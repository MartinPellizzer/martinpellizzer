                    <h1>Paraspalathus humifusa</h1>
<p>Paraspalathus humifusa, commonly known as the lowland spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the moist, shaded environments of tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring or early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Paraspalathus humifusa is adapted to thrive in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
