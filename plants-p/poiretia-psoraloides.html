                    <h1>Poiretia psoraloides</h1>
<p>Poiretia psoraloides, commonly known as the golden sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Poiretia psoraloides is notable for its ability to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments.</p>
