                    <h1>Pogonia triflora</h1>
<p>Pogonia triflora, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like flower that is typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and swamps, often growing along stream banks. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Pogonia triflora is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
