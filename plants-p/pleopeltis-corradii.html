<p>Pleopeltis corradii, commonly known as the Corradi's pleated fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain water in humid environments.</p>
<p>Pleopeltis corradii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to shaded, moist conditions.</p>
