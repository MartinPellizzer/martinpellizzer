                    <h1>Phlebodium salicifolium</h1>
<p>Phlebodium salicifolium, commonly known as the serrated wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with serrated edges, which are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the wild. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to its host, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and its adaptability to various indoor growing setups.</p>
