                    <h1>Pyrethrum galushkoi</h1>
<p>Pyrethrum galushkoi, commonly known as the Galushko's pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers with white centers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes on its leaves and stems, which are responsible for synthesizing natural pyrethrinsâ€”compounds with insecticidal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its chemical composition, it is of interest in both horticulture and pest control research.</p>
