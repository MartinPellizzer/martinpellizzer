                    <h1>Prunus zappeyana var. subsimplex</h1>
<p>Prunus zappeyana var. subsimplex, commonly known as the Zapeyana cherry, is a rare and ornamental species native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically darker green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by small, bright red fruits that are edible but not commonly cultivated. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
