                    <h1>Pimpinella tagawae</h1>
<p>Pimpinella tagawae, commonly known as the Japanese cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like flower clusters.</p>
<p>It is native to Japan and thrives in moist, woodland environments. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which disperse easily by wind.</p>
