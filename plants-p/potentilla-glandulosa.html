                    <h1>Potentilla glandulosa</h1>
<p>Potentilla glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, glandular-hairy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Potentilla glandulosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens.</p>
