                    <h1>Pterocaulon capitatum</h1>
<p>Pterocaulon capitatum, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Pterocaulon capitatum is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun conditions.</p>
