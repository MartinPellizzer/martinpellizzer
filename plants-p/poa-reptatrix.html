<p>Poa reptatrix, commonly known as the creeping meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and riverbanks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Poa reptatrix plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
