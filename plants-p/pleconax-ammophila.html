                    <h1>Pleconax ammophila</h1>
<p>Pleconax ammophila, commonly known as the dune morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils typical of dune environments. The plant produces showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Pleconax ammophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
