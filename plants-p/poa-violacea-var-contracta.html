<p>Poa violacea var. contracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and dense growth habit, making it suitable for turfgrass applications. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowering stems are often shorter than the leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often used in landscaping and erosion control.</p>
