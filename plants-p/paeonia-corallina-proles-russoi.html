                    <h1>Paeonia corallina proles russoi</h1>
<p>Paeonia corallina proles russoi, commonly known as the Russo's coral peony, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, coral-red flowers that bloom in early spring, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. Its foliage consists of large, palmately compound leaves that are dark green and velvety in texture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique botanical and horticultural value.</p>
