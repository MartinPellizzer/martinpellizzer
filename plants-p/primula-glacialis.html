                    <h1>Primula glacialis</h1>
<p>Primula glacialis, commonly known as the glacier primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments with limited soil and harsh weather conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are broad and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Primula glacialis plays an important role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing fragile mountain soils.</p>
