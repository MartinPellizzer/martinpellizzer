<p>Psylliostachys beludshistanicus, commonly known as the Beludshistan grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid regions.</p>
