                    <h1>Prosthechea pterocarpa</h1>
<p>Prosthechea pterocarpa, commonly known as the tree orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive red or purple lip. Its pseudobulbs are clustered and support the plant's structure, while its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Prosthechea pterocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
