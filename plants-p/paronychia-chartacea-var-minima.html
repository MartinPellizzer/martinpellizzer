                    <h1>Paronychia chartacea var. minima</h1>
<p>Paronychia chartacea var. minima, commonly known as the miniature marsh holly, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to wet, marshy environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, arranged in a dense, compact rosette. The plant produces tiny, white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in short inflorescences. Its leaves are succulent and have a waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in humid, boggy habitats.</p>
<p>It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
