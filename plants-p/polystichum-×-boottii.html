                    <h1>Polystichum × boottii</h1>
<p>Polystichum × boottii, commonly known as the Boott's wood fern, is a hybrid fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, arching fronds with a dark green color and a metallic sheen. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, fern-like appearance.</p>
