<p>Phyllostachys puberula var. flavescens, commonly known as the golden bamboo, is a variant of the silver bamboo species native to eastern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems that exhibit a distinctive golden-yellow coloration, especially in the younger shoots. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>This bamboo is also valued for its fast growth and ability to form dense clumps, which can be used for erosion control or as a decorative element in landscapes.</p>
