<p>Pleomele terniflora, commonly known as the three-leaf cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to 2 meters, giving the plant a dramatic appearance. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is considered a rare and valuable species.</p>
