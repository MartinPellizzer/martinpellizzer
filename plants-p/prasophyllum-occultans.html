                    <h1>Prasophyllum occultans</h1>
<p>Prasophyllum occultans, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, strap-like leaves and a single, delicate flower that typically blooms in late winter or early spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are often obscured by dense vegetation, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Prasophyllum occultans is considered endangered and is protected in several regions.</p>
