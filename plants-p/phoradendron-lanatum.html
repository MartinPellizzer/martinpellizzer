                    <h1>Phoradendron lanatum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron lanatum, commonly known as the silky mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are red and fleshy, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
