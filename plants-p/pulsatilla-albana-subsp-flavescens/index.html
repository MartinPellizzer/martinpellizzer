<p>White pasqueflower, scientifically known as Pulsatilla albana subsp. flavescens, is a striking alpine plant that thrives in high-altitude environments. With its delicate, cup-shaped blossoms and soft, fuzzy leaves, it is a symbol of resilience in harsh mountain climates. Native to regions like the Alps and the Carpathians, this species is often found in rocky soils and meadows where few plants can survive. Its flowers, which range from pale yellow to white, bloom in early spring, marking the arrival of warmer weather in cold regions. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, the white pasqueflower is also considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
