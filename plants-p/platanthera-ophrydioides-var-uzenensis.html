                    <h1>Platanthera ophrydioides var. uzenensis</h1>
<p>Platanthera ophrydioides var. uzenensis, commonly known as the Uzen marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a delicate, leafless stem that bears a single, showy, greenish-white to pale yellow flower. The plant thrives in wet, shaded habitats such as marshes and forested wetlands, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by flies, which are attracted by their strong, musty odor.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical conservation efforts.</p>
