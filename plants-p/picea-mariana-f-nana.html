                    <h1>Picea mariana f. nana</h1>
<p>Picea mariana f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf spruce, is a compact, low-growing variant of the white spruce.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green needles that are shorter than those of the typical white spruce, giving it a unique, bushy appearance. This variety is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor, acidic soils. It is often used as an ornamental plant in gardens due to its hardy nature and attractive form.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
