<p>Phedimus aizoon var. floribundus, commonly known as the silver carpet plant, is a low-growing perennial groundcover native to China.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, silvery-gray leaves that reflect light and reduce heat absorption. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers in early summer, adding a subtle ornamental touch. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover in shaded areas.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ability to spread easily make it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping.</p>
