<p>Pittosporum sinense, commonly known as Chinese pittosporum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China.</p>
<p>It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces fragrant white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which appear in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by small, round, orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly tasty.</p>
<p>Pittosporum sinense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
