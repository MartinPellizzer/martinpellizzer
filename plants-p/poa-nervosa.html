<p>Poa nervosa, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three bracteate florets. It is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is often found in moist to dry habitats.</p>
<p>Poa nervosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals.</p>
