                    <h1>Physalis suberosa</h1>
<p>Physalis suberosa, commonly known as the rough globeberry, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and produces small, yellow flowers that develop into inflated, orange-red fruits. The fruit, which is typically about 2â€“3 centimeters in diameter, contains numerous seeds enclosed in a papery membrane. The plant thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its edible fruits, though they are generally considered tart and less palatable than other physalis species.</p>
