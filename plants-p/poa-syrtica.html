                    <h1>Poa syrtica</h1>
<p>Poa syrtica, commonly known as the desert bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to whitish flowers, which are adapted to the harsh conditions of its environment. Poa syrtica is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common component of steppe and desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range.</p>
