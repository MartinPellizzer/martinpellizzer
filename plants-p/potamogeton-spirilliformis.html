<p>Potamogeton spirilliformis, commonly known as the spiral pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its scientific name. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are often spirally twisted around the stem. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>Potamogeton spirilliformis is often found in lakes, ponds, and wetlands where it contributes to water clarity and oxygenation.</p>
