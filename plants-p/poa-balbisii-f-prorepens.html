                    <h1>Poa balbisii f. prorepens</h1>
<p>Poa balbisii f. prorepens, commonly known as the prostrate meadow grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense ground cover. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
