<p>Paramapania rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated fern, is a rare and distinctive species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring elongated, strap-like fronds with a narrow, pointed apex. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures include small, spore-bearing sorus clusters located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Paramapania rostrata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
