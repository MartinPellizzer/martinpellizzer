                    <h1>Pedicularis nana</h1>
<p>Pedicularis nana, commonly known as the dwarf monkeyflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It produces showy, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often resembling those of orchids. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, nutrient-poor environments. It thrives in open, rocky habitats and is often found in tundra and mountain meadows.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and adaptation to harsh climates make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
