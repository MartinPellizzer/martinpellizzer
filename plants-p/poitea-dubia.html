                    <h1>Poitea dubia</h1>
<p>Poitea dubia, commonly known as the rare desert shrub, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, woody stems and narrow, succulent leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its seeds are encased in fluffy, wind-dispersed capsules, aiding in its survival in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Poitea dubia is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates.</p>
