<p>Piptocarpha venulosa, commonly known as the slender bluebunch wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing tufts. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ecological importance, it plays a key role in stabilizing soil and supporting wildlife in arid environments.</p>
