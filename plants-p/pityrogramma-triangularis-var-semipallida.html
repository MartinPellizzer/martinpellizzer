                    <h1>Pityrogramma triangularis var. semipallida</h1>
<p>Pityrogramma triangularis var. semipallida, commonly known as the pale lichen fern, is a variant of the triangular water fern.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, triangular fronds with a pale, almost whitish underside, distinguishing it from other varieties. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
