<p>Phyllostachys bambusoides var. boryana, commonly known as Boryana bamboo, is a cold-hardy ornamental bamboo native to China.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright culms that are typically green, with a smooth, slightly ridged surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late summer, though it is primarily cultivated for its attractive foliage and graceful form. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for gardens in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and compact size make it an ideal choice for container gardening or as a landscape accent.</p>
