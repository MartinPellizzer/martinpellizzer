                    <h1>Polytaenium quadriseriatum</h1>
<p>Polytaenium quadriseriatum, commonly known as the four-ribbed polytaenium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and requires a humid, shaded environment to flourish. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
