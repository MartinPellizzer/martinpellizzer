<p>Pachycentria lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Pachycentria lanceolata plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees.</p>
