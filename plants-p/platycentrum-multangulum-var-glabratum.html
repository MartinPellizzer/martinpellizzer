                    <h1>Platycentrum multangulum var. glabratum</h1>
<p>Platycentrum multangulum var. glabratum, commonly known as the smoothleaf platycentrum, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces delicate, clustered inflorescences with tiny, white flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
