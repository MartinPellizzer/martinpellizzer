                    <h1>Poa boryana</h1>
<p>Poa boryana, commonly known as the Arctic grass, is a perennial grass species native to cold climates, particularly in the Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, tufted stems and fine, soft leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa boryana is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including low temperatures and poor soil, making it a resilient member of tundra and mountain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a pioneer species in disturbed or barren landscapes.</p>
