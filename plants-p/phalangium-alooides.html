                    <h1>Phalangium alooides</h1>
<p>Phalangium alooides, commonly known as the cannonball plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that resembles a cannonball, which stores water to help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, green, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It blooms with clusters of yellowish-white flowers during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to dry environments makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
