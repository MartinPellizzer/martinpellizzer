                    <h1>Parathelypteris hattorii</h1>
<p>Parathelypteris hattorii, commonly known as Hattori's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sori are clustered and located on the abaxial side of the pinnae, a feature typical of many ferns in its family.</p>
<p>The spores are released through small, round, operculum-covered structures called annulus, which aid in dispersal.</p>
