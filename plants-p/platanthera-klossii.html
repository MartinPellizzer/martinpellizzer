                    <h1>Platanthera klossii</h1>
<p>Platanthera klossii, commonly known as Kloss's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or montane grasslands. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Platanthera klossii is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
