                    <h1>Polygala phlebotaenia var. obovata</h1>
<p>Polygala phlebotaenia var. obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems that often grow from the base, and its leaves are typically obovate, meaning they are broadest near the base and taper towards the tip. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive spurred structure on the petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its broader leaf shape compared to the typical form of Polygala phlebotaenia.</p>
