<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its aromatic, needle-like foliage and distinct cone structures. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate, which contributes to its limited distribution and conservation status. Its botanical features include a rugged bark and a preference for well-drained, acidic soils in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This variety is of significant interest to botanists due to its unique genetic makeup and ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>
