<p>Pelecyphora vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous liverwort, is a type of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a thalloid structure, with a leafy, flattened body that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. It reproduces through spores, and some species, including Pelecyphora vivipara, can produce offspring from structures called gemmae, which are small, vegetative propagules.</p>
<p>This species plays a vital role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
