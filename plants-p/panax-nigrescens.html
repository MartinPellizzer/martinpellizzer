                    <h1>Panax nigrescens</h1>
<p>Panax nigrescens, commonly known as black ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its dark, almost black roots, which are highly valued in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and has compound leaves with serrated edges. Its flowering occurs in late summer, producing small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by red berries.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Panax nigrescens is now critically endangered in the wild.</p>
