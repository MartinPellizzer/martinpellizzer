                    <h1>Pityrogramma calomelanos var. distans</h1>
<p>Pityrogramma calomelanos var. distans, commonly known as the distant male fern, is a variant of the male fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae, characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns.</p>
<p>The varietal distinction of distans is based on subtle differences in frond morphology compared to the typical form of Pityrogramma calomelanos.</p>
