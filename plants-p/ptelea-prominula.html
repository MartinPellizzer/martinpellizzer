<p>Ptelea prominula, commonly known as the spreading leaf sandverbena, is a small shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
