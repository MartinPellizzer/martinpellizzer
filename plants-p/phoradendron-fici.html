                    <h1>Phoradendron fici</h1>
<p>Phoradendron fici, commonly known as the fig mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host, typically ficus trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant forms a dense, leafy growth that can cover large portions of the host's branches. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually green or white, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This relationship can weaken the host tree over time, making it an ecologically significant but sometimes problematic species.</p>
