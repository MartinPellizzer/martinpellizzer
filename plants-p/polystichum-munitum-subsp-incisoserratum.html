<p>Polystichum munitum subsp.</p>
<p>incisoserratum, commonly known as the Pacific silver fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It features a compact, upright growth habit with lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are dark green and often have a silvery underside.</p>
<p>The fronds are characterized by their finely toothed margins, which give the plant its subspecies name, incisoserratum. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its ability to form dense, spreading colonies.</p>
