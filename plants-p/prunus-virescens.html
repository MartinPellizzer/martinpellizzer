                    <h1>Prunus virescens</h1>
<p>Prunus virescens, commonly known as the green cherry or the sweet cherry, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 meters, featuring a rounded canopy and smooth, gray bark. The plant produces showy white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, green fruits that ripen to a reddish color. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Prunus virescens is often cultivated for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it is less commonly used for commercial cherry production compared to other Prunus species.</p>
