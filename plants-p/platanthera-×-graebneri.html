                    <h1>Platanthera × graebneri</h1>
<p>Platanthera × graebneri, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Platanthera falcata and Platanthera psycodes, resulting in a unique combination of characteristics from both parents. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows, often in areas with rich, organic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
