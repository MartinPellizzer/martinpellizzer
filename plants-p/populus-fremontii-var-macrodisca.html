                    <h1>Populus fremontii var. macrodisca</h1>
<p>Populus fremontii var. macrodisca, commonly known as the Fremont's cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds encased in a cotton-like covering, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in riparian zones and is adapted to arid environments with periodic flooding.</p>
<p>Its bark is typically gray to brown, becoming fissured with age, and it plays an important role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
