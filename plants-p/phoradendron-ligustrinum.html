                    <h1>Phoradendron ligustrinum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron ligustrinum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the families Fabaceae and Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Phoradendron ligustrinum plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by providing food for various bird species and contributing to the ecological balance of its host trees.</p>
