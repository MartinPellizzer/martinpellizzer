                    <h1>Phoradendron duidanum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron duidanum, commonly known as the Mexican mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ecological role in supporting bird populations and contributing to forest biodiversity.</p>
