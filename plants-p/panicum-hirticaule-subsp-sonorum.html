<p>Panicum hirticaule subsp.</p>
<p>sonorum, commonly known as Sonoran hairgrass, is a grass species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous narrow leaves, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing desert soils and supporting local wildlife.</p>
