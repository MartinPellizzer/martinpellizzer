<p>Polypodium vagans, commonly known as the wandering fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that often trail from its rhizome, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Polypodium vagans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in controlled indoor settings.</p>
