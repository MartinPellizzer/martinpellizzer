<p>Pseuderucaria clavata subsp.</p>
<p>tourneuxii, commonly known as the Tourneux's clubmoss, is a rare and specialized member of the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a distinctive, clustered arrangement of sporophylls.</p>
<p>This subspecies is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures are adapted for spore dispersal in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
