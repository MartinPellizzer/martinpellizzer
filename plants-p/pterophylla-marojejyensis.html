                    <h1>Pterophylla marojejyensis</h1>
<p>Pterophylla marojejyensis, commonly known as the Marojejy star orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking star-shaped flowers, which are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive central dark spot. The plant thrives in the humid, shaded understory of tropical rainforests, where it forms symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are broad and glossy, adapted to capture limited light in its dense forest habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragmentation, Pterophylla marojejyensis is considered critically endangered.</p>
