                    <h1>Passerina obtusifolia</h1>
<p>Passerina obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leaf pasqueflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, fleshy, oblanceolate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white to grayish hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a raceme at the tip of the stem. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
