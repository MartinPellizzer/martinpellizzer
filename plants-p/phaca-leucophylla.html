The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-white, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Phaca leucophylla produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
