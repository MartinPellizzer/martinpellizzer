                    <h1>Plantago glomerata</h1>
<p>Plantago glomerata, commonly known as clustered plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish flowers on slender stalks, which bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are enclosed in a tough, three-lobed capsule that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, and it has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
