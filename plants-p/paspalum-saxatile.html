<p>Paspalum saxatile, commonly known as rock paspalum, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in rocky or sandy environments.</p>
<p>Paspalum saxatile is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
