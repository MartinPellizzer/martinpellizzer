<p>Potamogeton obtusus var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine pondweed, is a aquatic plant native to cold, oligotrophic lakes and ponds in alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically smooth and slightly pointed. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spikes, often appearing in late summer. It thrives in shallow, nutrient-poor waters with good water circulation.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of high water quality and minimal human disturbance.</p>
