<p>Pedicularis brachyodonta var. heterodonta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
