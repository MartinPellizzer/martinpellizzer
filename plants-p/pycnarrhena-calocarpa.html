<p>Pycnarrhena calocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruit pycnarrhena, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, spherical fruits that turn red when mature. Its fruit is an important food source for various bird species, contributing to seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique floral structure, it is often used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
