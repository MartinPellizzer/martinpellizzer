<p>Panicum hispidulum, commonly known as hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects.</p>
