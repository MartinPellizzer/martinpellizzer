<p>Prosopis articulata, commonly known as the screwbean mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. The plant has small, feathery leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall.</p>
<p>Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it a valuable plant in desert ecosystems.</p>
