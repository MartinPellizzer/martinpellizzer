                    <h1>Peristylus gramineus</h1>
<p>Peristylus gramineus, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the stems of other plants, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Peristylus gramineus is native to Australia and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
