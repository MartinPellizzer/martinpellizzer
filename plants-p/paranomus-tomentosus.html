                    <h1>Paranomus tomentosus</h1>
<p>Paranomus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly parasol mushroom, is a species of fungi characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like cap covered in a dense, white tomentum or veil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tricholomataceae and is typically found in forested areas, often growing on decaying wood. The stem is usually short and stout, with a fibrous texture, and the gills are initially white but may change color as the fungus matures.</p>
<p>This mushroom is not considered edible and is often avoided due to its potential to cause gastrointestinal distress.</p>
