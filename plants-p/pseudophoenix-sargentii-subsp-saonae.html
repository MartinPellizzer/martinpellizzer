<p>Pseudophoenix sargentii subsp.</p>
<p>saonae, commonly known as the Sargent's date palm, is a rare and endemic palm species native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of long, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, date-like fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapted to the unique climate of Socotra.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
