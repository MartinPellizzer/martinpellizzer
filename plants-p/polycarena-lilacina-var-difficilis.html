<p>Polycarena lilacina var. difficilis, commonly known as the purple orchid grass, is a rare and ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like stems with striking purple and lilac-colored inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.
