<p>Pyrus badensis, commonly known as the Baden pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. The plant is characterized by its deciduous habit, with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit, a small pear-like berry, is typically edible and has been historically used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus badensis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
