                    <h1>Pyrola asarifolia var. uliginosa</h1>
<p>Pyrola asarifolia var. uliginosa, commonly known as the bog snowbell, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in acidic, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and heathlands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are clustered at the base of the stems. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinct, aromatic scent when crushed.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often considered an indicator species for undisturbed, wetland ecosystems.</p>
