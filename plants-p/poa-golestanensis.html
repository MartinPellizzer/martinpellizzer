                    <h1>Poa golestanensis</h1>
<p>Poa golestanensis, commonly known as the Golestan grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of Iran, particularly in the Golestan Province, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Poa golestanensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
