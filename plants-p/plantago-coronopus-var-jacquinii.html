<p>Plantago coronopus var. jacquinii, commonly known as the Jacquin's plantain, is a variant of the common plantain, characterized by its distinctive foliage and growth habits.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist, calcareous soils. The leaves are lanceolate, with a rough, hairy surface, and the plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>This variant is less common than the typical form of Plantago coronopus and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists.</p>
