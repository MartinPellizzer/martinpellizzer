<p>Psidium cinereum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf guava, is a tropical plant belonging to the Myrtaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that are generally not as flavorful as those of the common guava. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some limited use in local cuisines.</p>
