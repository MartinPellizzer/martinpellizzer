                    <h1>Poa supina var. exigua</h1>
<p>Poa supina var. exigua, commonly known as the dwarf bentgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, creeping stems that produce small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and covered with a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its dense, carpet-like appearance.</p>
