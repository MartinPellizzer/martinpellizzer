                    <h1>Pinalia lyonii</h1>
<p>Pinalia lyonii, commonly known as the Lyon's pinyon, is a rare and endemic shrub native to specific regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Pinaceae family, which includes pines and other conifers, though it is not a true pine. The plant is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and produces cone-like structures that contain its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited geographic range and habitat specificity, Pinalia lyonii is considered a botanically significant species for ecological and conservation studies.</p>
