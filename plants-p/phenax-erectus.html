                    <h1>Phenax erectus</h1>
<p>Phenax erectus, commonly known as the upright fenax, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery down. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as streams and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Phenax erectus is considered endangered and is protected in several European countries.</p>
