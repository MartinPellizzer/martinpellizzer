                    <h1>Prunus spinosa f. sessiliflora</h1>
<p>Prunus spinosa f. sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-leaved blackthorn, is a compact shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a variant of the common blackthorn, characterized by its shorter, sessile leaves that are often clustered closely along the stems. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its flowers are white and appear in clusters, blooming before the leaves emerge in early spring.</p>
<p>This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and seasonal interest.</p>
