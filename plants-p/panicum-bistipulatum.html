<p>Panicum bistipulatum, commonly known as the two-leaf panicgrass, is a species of grass native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
