                    <h1>Platostoma ocimoides</h1>
<p>Platostoma ocimoides, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes. It is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological stability of these environments.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for moist conditions, it is an indicator species for areas with high water tables.</p>
