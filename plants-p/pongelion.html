                    <h1>Pongelion</h1>
<p>Pongelion, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. Pongelion has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, fragrant blooms that are often hidden among the foliage.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and its extremely limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
