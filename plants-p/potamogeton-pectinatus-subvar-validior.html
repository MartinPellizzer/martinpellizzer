<p>Potamogeton pectinatus subvar. validior, commonly known as the broad-leaf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow waters, often forming dense mats that provide habitat for aquatic organisms. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are broad at the base and taper towards the tip, with a smooth or slightly serrated surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, and it produces elongated, cylindrical fruits.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in water ecosystems by contributing to water clarity and supporting aquatic biodiversity.</p>
