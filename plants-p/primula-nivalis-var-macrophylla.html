                    <h1>Primula nivalis var. macrophylla</h1>
<p>Primula nivalis var. macrophylla, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The leaves are broadly ovate, hairy, and often covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
