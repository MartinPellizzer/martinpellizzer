<p>Panicum controversum, commonly known as the controversial grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open woods.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and sometimes invasive growth, it is both a useful forage plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
