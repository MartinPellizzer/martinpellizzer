<p>Polypodium capitellatum, commonly known as the hooded fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are typically covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
