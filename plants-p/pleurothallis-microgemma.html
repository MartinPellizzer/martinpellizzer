<p>Pleurothallis microgemma, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a small epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features delicate, narrow leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique beauty and botanical interest.</p>
