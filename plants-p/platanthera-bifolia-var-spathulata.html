                    <h1>Platanthera bifolia var. spathulata</h1>
<p>Platanthera bifolia var. spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to moist, shaded habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features a tall, slender stem with a dense cluster of pale green to white, fragrant flowers arranged in a spiral. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Platanthera bifolia.</p>
