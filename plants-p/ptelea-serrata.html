                    <h1>Ptelea serrata</h1>
<p>Ptelea serrata, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely serrated leaves and rough, fissured bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by elliptical, winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and canyons.</p>
<p>Ptelea serrata is well adapted to drought conditions and is an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
