                    <h1>Peliosanthes humilis</h1>
<p>Peliosanthes humilis, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of Socotra.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its short, stout trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a living fossil and is protected in its native habitat.</p>
