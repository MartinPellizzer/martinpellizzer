<p>Polystichum australium, commonly known as the southern wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to southern regions of the United States.</p>
<p>It features compound, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and leathery, with a dense, upright growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces sexually through spore dispersal.</p>
<p>The fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
