<p>Pityrogramma × mckenneyi, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a fern species resulting from the cross between Pityrogramma calomoda and Pityrogramma mirabilis.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive shield-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it exhibits a unique morphology with a short, thick rhizome.</p>
<p>This hybrid is often found in the southeastern United States, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates.</p>
