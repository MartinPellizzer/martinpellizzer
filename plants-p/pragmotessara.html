                    <h1>Pragmotessara</h1>
<p>Pragmotessara, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear almost ethereal under sunlight. The plant produces small, pale pink blossoms that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, a unique adaptation to attract nocturnal pollinators. Pragmotessara thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a delicately endangered species.</p>
