<p>Parrisia parietina, commonly known as the wall rue, is a species of fern native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, deciduous fern that typically grows on rocky or shaded walls, where it thrives in humid conditions. The plant features a creeping rhizome with dark green, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern.</p>
<p>Parrisia parietina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize difficult, rocky environments.</p>
