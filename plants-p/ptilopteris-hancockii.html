<p>Ptilopteris hancockii, commonly known as Hancock's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are adapted for life in freshwater environments. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches, where it can anchor itself to submerged substrates. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help in nutrient absorption and stabilization.</p>
<p>Ptilopteris hancockii plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments and supporting aquatic biodiversity.</p>
