<p>Pedicularis gyroflexa subsp.</p>
<p>gyroflexa, commonly known as the spiral monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its striking, spiral-shaped flowers that resemble a monkey's face, hence its common name. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
