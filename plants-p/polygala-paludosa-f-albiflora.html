                    <h1>Polygala paludosa f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Polygala paludosa f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered marsh milkvetch, is a rare and delicate plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, clustered white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in bogs or along the edges of marshes. Its flowers are typically arranged in spikes and are pollinated by insects, particularly flies and beetles.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
