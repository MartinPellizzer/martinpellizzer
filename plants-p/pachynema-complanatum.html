                    <h1>Pachynema complanatum</h1>
<p>Pachynema complanatum, commonly known as the flat moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, ribbon-like thallus that grows in dense mats on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, undifferentiated body called a thallus. It reproduces through spores released from tiny, cup-like structures called peristomes.</p>
<p>Pachynema complanatum is often found in temperate regions and is an important indicator species for undisturbed, moist habitats.</p>
