<p>Plantago gooddingii, commonly known as Goodding's plantain, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, and it produces small, clustered flowers in early spring. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
