                    <h1>Polycarpon diffusum</h1>
<p>Polycarpon diffusum, commonly known as broadleaf nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by smooth, spherical berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic berries, it should be handled with care.</p>
