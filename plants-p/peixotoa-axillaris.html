<p>Peixotoa axillaris, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees, utilizing its roots to anchor itself while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.

It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high air circulation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected botanical gardens.</p>
