                    <h1>Palma altissima</h1>
<p>Palma altissima, commonly known as the giant palm, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its slow growth rate makes it a long-lived species, often reaching heights of over 20 meters.</p>
<p>The palm is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes.</p>
