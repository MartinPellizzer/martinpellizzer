<p>Polystichum wilesianum, commonly known as the Wilesian shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
