<p>Pteris alcyonis, commonly known as the shield fern, is a compact evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are dark green and slightly curled. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in indoor gardening.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements.</p>
