                    <h1>Polystichum × tare-bhirense</h1>
<p>Polystichum × tare-bhirense, commonly known as the hybrid holly fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Polystichum tare and Polystichum bhirense.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its lush, dark green fronds with a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it lacks true flowers, relying solely on spore propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
