<p>Pediocactus nyensis, commonly known as the New Mexico prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are pollinated by insects. Its thick, fleshy pads are adapted for photosynthesis and water retention.</p>
<p>Pediocactus nyensis is often found in rocky soils and is a symbol of the desert's resilience.</p>
