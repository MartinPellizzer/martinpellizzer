<p>Phegopteris finisterrae, commonly known as the Canary Islands fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
