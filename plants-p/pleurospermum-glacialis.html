                    <h1>Pleurospermum glacialis</h1>
<p>Pleurospermum glacialis, commonly known as the alpine tansy, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Pleurospermum glacialis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
