<p>Parapolydora fastigiata, commonly known as the tall rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense clumps, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with long, narrow leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>Parapolydora fastigiata plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms.</p>
