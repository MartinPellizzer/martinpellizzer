<p>Polystichum tumbatzense, commonly known as the Tumbaz√© fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and slightly curled. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in shaded, forested areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Polystichum tumbatzense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
