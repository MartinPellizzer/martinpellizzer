<p>Primula heucherifolia subsp.</p>
<p>humicola, commonly known as the mossy primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It features dense, basal rosettes of dark green, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its foliage resembles that of heuchera, hence its scientific name, and it is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens.</p>
