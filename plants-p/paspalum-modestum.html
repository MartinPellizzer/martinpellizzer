                    <h1>Paspalum modestum</h1>
<p>Paspalum modestum, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and coastal prairies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is drought-tolerant and salt-resistant, making it well adapted to harsh coastal environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various coastal wildlife species.</p>
