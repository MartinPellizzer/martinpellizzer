                    <h1>Punica granatum f. albescens</h1>
<p>Punica granatum f. albescens, commonly known as the white pomegranate, is a cultivar of the pomegranate tree characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and fruit.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its reduced pigmentation compared to typical pomegranates, which results in a more delicate appearance. The plant retains the typical structure of the pomegranate, with broad, lance-shaped leaves and a robust, thorny stem. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>While the fruit is edible, it is generally smaller and less flavorful than the standard pomegranate.</p>
