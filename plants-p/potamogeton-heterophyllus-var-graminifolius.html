<p>Potamogeton heterophyllus var. graminifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that are often narrow and grass-like in appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually borne in spike-like clusters. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its submerged growth habit, it is often difficult to detect until it reaches the flowering stage.</p>
