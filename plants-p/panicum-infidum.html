<p>Panicum infidum, commonly known as the devil's needle, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. The plant thrives in wet, disturbed soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a persistent weed in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
