                    <h1>Poa pollinensis</h1>
<p>Poa pollinensis, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-blue foliage, which helps it thrive in cold, nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in alpine meadows, rocky slopes, and mountainous areas where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, Poa pollinensis is a valuable component of ecological restoration projects in harsh climates.</p>
