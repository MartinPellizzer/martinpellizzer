                    <h1>Picea polita</h1>
<p>Picea polita, commonly known as the smooth white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its distinctive smooth, white bark that becomes flaky with age. The tree produces small, cone-like seed structures that mature in the second year, releasing winged seeds for wind dispersal. Its needle-like leaves are short, flat, and have a silvery-blue appearance, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Picea polita is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in boreal forests and subarctic regions.</p>
