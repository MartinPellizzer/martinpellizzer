<p>Phelypaea emarginata, commonly known as the marginal water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, serrated segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Phelypaea emarginata plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
