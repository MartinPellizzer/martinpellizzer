                    <h1>Plantago arabica</h1>
<p>Plantago arabica, commonly known as the greater plantain, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are thick and fleshy, capable of storing water, which helps it survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Plantago arabica is often found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and along fences, making it a common weed in many areas.</p>
