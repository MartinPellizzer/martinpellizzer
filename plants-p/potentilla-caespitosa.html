                    <h1>Potentilla caespitosa</h1>
<p>Potentilla caespitosa, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with slender, wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread readily. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in cymes. Its leaves are narrow, alternate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Potentilla caespitosa is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
