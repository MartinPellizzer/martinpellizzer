<p>Pyxidaria subulata, commonly known as the needleleaf pyxidaria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it is well adapted to dry conditions with its succulent stems and reduced leaves.</p>
<p>Pyxidaria subulata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
