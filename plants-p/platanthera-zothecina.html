                    <h1>Platanthera zothecina</h1>
<p>Platanthera zothecina, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces pale yellow to greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose raceme, with the petals and sepals forming a distinctive hood-like structure. It thrives in moist, acidic soils in shaded forest understories, often near streams or wetlands.</p>
<p>The orchid is pollinated by flies and is considered rare due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
