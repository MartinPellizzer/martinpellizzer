                    <h1>Parnassia palustris var. yakusimensis</h1>
<p>Parnassia palustris var. yakusimensis, commonly known as the Yakusim Parnassia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and rocky slopes. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its subtle morphological differences from the typical Parnassia palustris, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
