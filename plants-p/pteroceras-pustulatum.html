<p>Pteroceras pustulatum, commonly known as the blistered clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant is notable for its spore-bearing structures, which are clustered in cone-like formations called strobili. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
