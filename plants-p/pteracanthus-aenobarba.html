                    <h1>Pteracanthus aenobarba</h1>
<p>Pteracanthus aenobarba, commonly known as the barbed wing fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that have a serrated or barbed appearance along the edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is fibrous and helps anchor it to rocky substrates or tree trunks.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
