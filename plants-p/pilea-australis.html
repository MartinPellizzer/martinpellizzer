                    <h1>Pilea australis</h1>
<p>Pilea australis, commonly known as the water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water and wetlands, with its leaves floating on the surface. The plant has a rosette-like structure with thick, waxy leaves that help it float and retain moisture. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Pilea australis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
