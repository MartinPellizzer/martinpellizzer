                    <h1>Polythecium pumilum</h1>
<p>Polythecium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf polypore, is a small, saprophytic fungus that grows on dead wood.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polyporaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like cap and white to pale yellow pores. The mushroom is typically found in temperate forests, where it decomposes fallen timber. Its spores are released from the underside of the cap and are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and specific habitat, it is often overlooked but plays an important role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.</p>
