                    <h1>Pilosella × solacolui</h1>
<p>Pilosella × solacolui, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a hybrid plant in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, thriving in rocky and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
