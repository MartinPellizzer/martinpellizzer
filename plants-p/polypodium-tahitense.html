<p>Polypodium tahitense, commonly known as the Tahitian water fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in Polynesian cultures.</p>
