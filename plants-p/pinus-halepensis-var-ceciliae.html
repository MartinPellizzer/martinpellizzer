                    <h1>Pinus halepensis var. ceciliae</h1>
<p>Pinus halepensis var. ceciliae, commonly known as the Cecilia Aleppo pine, is a variant of the Aleppo pine native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically shorter and more clustered than those of the typical Aleppo pine. The cones of this variety are usually smaller and more compact, with a distinctive shape that sets it apart from other Pinus species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, temperate climates.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in rocky or coastal areas where it contributes to local biodiversity and ecosystem stability.</p>
