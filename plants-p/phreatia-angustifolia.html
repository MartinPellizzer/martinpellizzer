<p>Phreatia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed phreatia, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces pendant, yellow-green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to trees without parasitizing them.</p>
<p>Phreatia angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded gardens.</p>
