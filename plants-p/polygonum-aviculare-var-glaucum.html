                    <h1>Polygonum aviculare var. glaucum</h1>
<p>Polygonum aviculare var. glaucum, commonly known as silver knotgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in a dense layer of fine, whitish hairs.</p>
<p>The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and often exhibit a bluish-green hue due to the presence of these hairs. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant is adaptable to various soil types and thrives in disturbed areas, making it a common weed in agricultural and urban settings.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively contribute to its success in colonizing new environments.</p>
