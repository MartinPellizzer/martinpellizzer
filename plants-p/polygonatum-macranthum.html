<p>Polygonatum macranthum, commonly known as the large-flowered Solomon's seal, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its arching stems and clusters of bell-shaped, white or greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, dark berries that ripen in late summer, and its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Polygonatum macranthum thrives in shady, moist woodland environments and is often used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
