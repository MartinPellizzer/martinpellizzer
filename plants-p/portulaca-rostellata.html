<p>Portulaca rostellata, commonly known as the coral plant or red sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, succulent perennial that produces vibrant red or orange flowers. The plant has fleshy, cylindrical stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters at the tips of the stems and bloom in summer.</p>
<p>Portulaca rostellata is well adapted to hot, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
