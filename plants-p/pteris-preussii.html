                    <h1>Pteris preussii</h1>
<p>Pteris preussii, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically light green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate, while its spore-producing sorus is located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Pteris preussii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
