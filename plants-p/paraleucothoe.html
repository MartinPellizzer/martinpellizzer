                    <h1>Paraleucothoe</h1>
<p>Paraleucothoe, commonly known as the silverleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers in late spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Paraleucothoe thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and seasonal interest, though it can be invasive in some regions.</p>
