<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are submerged and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
