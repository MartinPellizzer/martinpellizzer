<p>Polystichum lucidum, commonly known as the shining wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that are covered in a waxy, glossy cuticle, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically growing in shaded forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fiddleheads emerging each spring and maturing throughout the growing season.</p>
