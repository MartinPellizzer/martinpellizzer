<p>Pleurosorus rutifolius, commonly known as the rusty back fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored bloom. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the forest floor.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded sori.</p>
