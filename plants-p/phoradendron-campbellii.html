<p>Phoradendron campbellii, commonly known as the Campbell's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides some ecological benefits by serving as a food source for birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its berries are typically consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds to new host trees, facilitating its propagation.</p>
