<p>Pogonia simplex, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>

Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a unique visual element to the forest floor.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
