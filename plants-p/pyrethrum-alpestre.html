                    <h1>Pyrethrum alpestre</h1>
<p>Pyrethrum alpestre, commonly known as the alpine pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes on its leaves and stems, which contribute to its natural insect-repelling properties. Its flowers are typically bright yellow, with a distinctive central disc surrounded by petal-like bracts.</p>
<p>Pyrethrum alpestre is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in natural pest control.</p>
