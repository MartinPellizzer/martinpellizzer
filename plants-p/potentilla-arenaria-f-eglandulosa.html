                    <h1>Potentilla arenaria f. eglandulosa</h1>
<p>Potentilla arenaria f. eglandulosa, commonly known as the sandstone cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and rocky environments in Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant's foliage is typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This form is distinguished by the absence of glandular structures on its leaves, a key feature that sets it apart from other varieties of Potentilla arenaria.</p>
