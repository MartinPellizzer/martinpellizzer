<p>Pteridella hastata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it anchors itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread along the substrate, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, serrated pinnae that contribute to its distinctive appearance.</p>
