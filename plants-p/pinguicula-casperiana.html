                    <h1>Pinguicula casperiana</h1>
<p>Pinguicula casperiana, commonly known as the Casper's butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of short, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in nutrient-poor habitats by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
