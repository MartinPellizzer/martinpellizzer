                    <h1>Podocarpus coriaceus</h1>
<p>Podocarpus coriaceus, commonly known as the Indian teak or Indian oak, is a slow-growing evergreen tree native to southern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as a landscape tree and for its durable wood.</p>
