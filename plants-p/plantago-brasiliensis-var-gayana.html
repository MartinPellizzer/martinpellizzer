<p>Plantago brasiliensis var. gayana, commonly known as the Brazilian plantain or Gayana plantain, is a species of flowering plant in the family Plantaginaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Plantago brasiliensis.</p>
