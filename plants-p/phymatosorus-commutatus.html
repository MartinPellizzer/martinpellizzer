<p>Phymatosorus commutatus, commonly known as the crested fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, densely hairy fronds that give it a unique, almost fuzzy appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
