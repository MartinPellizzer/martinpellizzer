<p>Polypodium subarboreum, commonly known as the tree fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Its rhizome is thick and woody, providing structural support as it climbs toward light.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which helps attract pollinators.</p>
