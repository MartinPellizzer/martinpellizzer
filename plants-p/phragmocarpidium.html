                    <h1>Phragmocarpidium</h1>
<p>Phragmocarpidium, commonly known as the "bottle-shaped spore capsule," is a unique structure found in certain species of fungi.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, flask-like shape, which is formed by the fusion of the sporangium and the stalk. The capsule is typically covered in a thick, waxy cuticle that helps protect the spores from desiccation. Inside, the spores are arranged in a single layer, often with a distinctive ornamentation.</p>
<p>This structure plays a crucial role in the dispersal and survival of the fungal species in various ecological niches.</p>
