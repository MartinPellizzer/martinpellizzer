<p>Picea obovata subsp.</p>
<p>tschiketamanica, commonly known as the Tschiketamanica fir, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the high-altitude regions of the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more rigid compared to other fir species.</p>
<p>The cones are typically pendulous and contain small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in subalpine and alpine zones.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss.</p>
