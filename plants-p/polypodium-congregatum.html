                    <h1>Polypodium congregatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium congregatum, commonly known as the clustered maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often grow in clusters. The plant typically attaches itself to trees or rocks, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense mats, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are adorned with tiny, tooth-like serrations.</p>
