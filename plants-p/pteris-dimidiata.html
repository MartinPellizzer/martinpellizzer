<p>[WRONG START] Pteris dimimiata, commonly known as the split fern or the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds that have a zigzag or undulating pattern, giving it its common name. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
