                    <h1>Pulsatilla micrantha</h1>
<p>Pulsatilla micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf pasqueflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its early spring blooming habit, typically emerging when snow is still present. The plant features a short, thick rhizome and produces showy, single or clustered flowers with five to seven petal-like sepals. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Pulsatilla micrantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
