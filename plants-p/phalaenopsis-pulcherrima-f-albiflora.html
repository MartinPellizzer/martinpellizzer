                    <h1>Phalaenopsis pulcherrima f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Phalaenopsis pulcherrima f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered moth orchid, is a hybrid orchid prized for its elegant appearance.</p>
<p>It features long, slender leaves and produces clusters of white flowers with a subtle fragrance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, well-lit environments. It requires moderate watering and well-draining potting media to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its parentage, combining traits from Phalaenopsis pulcherrima and a white-flowered variant.</p>
