                    <h1>Pinus mugo var. pumilio</h1>
<p>Pinus mugo var. pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a compact, shrub-like conifer native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slow growth, dense foliage, and twisted, gnarled branches that form a cushion-like shape. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, and it is well adapted to harsh, rocky environments. Its needles are short and dark green, often with a slight blue-gray tinge, and it is highly frost-resistant.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging climates.</p>
