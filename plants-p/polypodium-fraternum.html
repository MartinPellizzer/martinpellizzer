<p>Polypodium fraternum, commonly known as the common wall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
