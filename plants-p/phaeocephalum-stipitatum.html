<p>Phaeocephalum stipitatum, commonly known as the black-stemmed clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, dark green stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the sporangia for spore production. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its primitive structure, it provides valuable insights into the evolution of early land plants.</p>
