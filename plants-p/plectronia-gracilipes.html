<p>Plectronia gracilipes, commonly known as the slender feather fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Plectronia gracilipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
