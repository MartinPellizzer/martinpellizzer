                    <h1>Pleopeltis</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis, commonly known as the rock fern or staghorn fern, is a genus of epiphytic and lithophytic ferns native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>These plants typically grow on rocks or trees, anchoring themselves with their rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. They possess a distinctive frond structure, with a fleshy, lobed shield on the underside that helps retain water. The leaves are usually compound, with a broad, fan-like shape that aids in photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Pleopeltis species are valued in horticulture for their unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
