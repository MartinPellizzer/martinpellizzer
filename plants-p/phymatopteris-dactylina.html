<p>Phymatopteris dactylina, commonly known as the rockcap fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky soils and in arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Phymatopteris dactylina plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to harsh climates.</p>
