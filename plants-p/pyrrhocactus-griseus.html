<p>Pyrrhocactus griseus, commonly known as the gray prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny areoles, typical of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its stems to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Pyrrhocactus griseus is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun.</p>
