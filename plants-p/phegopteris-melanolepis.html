<p>Phegopteris melanolepis, commonly known as the black-stained water fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate-shaped pinnae that contribute to its distinctive appearance.</p>
