                    <h1>Physothallis</h1>
<p>Physothallis, commonly known as the bladder moss, is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>These small, non-vascular plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. They have a distinctive morphology with a leafy shoot that is often covered in a dense layer of tiny, cup-like structures called gemmae. The reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature.</p>
<p>Physothallis species are often used in ecological studies due to their sensitivity to environmental changes and their role in soil stabilization.</p>
