<p>Pterolepis weddelliana f. elatior, commonly known as the Weddell's pterolepis, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and compound leaves. The plant features a slender, branched stem with small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels.

<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
