<p>Pleurothallis incurva, commonly known as the hooked pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant produces elliptical, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Pleurothallis incurva is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate with proper care.</p>
