<p>Polypodium vulgare var. caprinum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, shaded environments, often growing on limestone or slate. The plant has a creeping rhizome with fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and its preference for humid, cool climates.</p>
