<p>Phoradendron proctorii, commonly known as Proctor's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its parasitic nature allows it to derive water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
<p>Phoradendron proctorii plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for various species.</p>
