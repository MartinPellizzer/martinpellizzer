                    <h1>Peltophorus forficulatus var. hirsuta</h1>
<p>Peltophorus forficulatus var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy bladder fern, is a variant of the bladder fern species native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, bladder-like formations along the fronds.</p>
<p>The hairy texture of the leaves is a distinguishing feature that aids in its identification and adaptation to its habitat.</p>
