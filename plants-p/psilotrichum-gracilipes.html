                    <h1>Psilotrichum gracilipes</h1>
<p>Psilotrichum gracilipes, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its primitive structure provides insights into the evolutionary history of early land plants.</p>
