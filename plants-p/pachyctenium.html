                    <h1>Pachyctenium</h1>
<p>Pachyctenium, commonly known as the broad-leafed grass or false panic grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family.</p>
<p>It consists of several species native to Australia, characterized by their tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plants typically produce small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers. They are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Pachyctenium species are adapted to arid conditions, with deep root systems that help them survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
