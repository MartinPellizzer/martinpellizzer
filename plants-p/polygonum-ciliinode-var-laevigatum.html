                    <h1>Polygonum ciliinode var. laevigatum</h1>
<p>Polygonum ciliinode var. laevigatum, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinct swollen nodes along the stem. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with smooth margins and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive.</p>
