<p>Potentilla nivea var. macrophylla, commonly known as the snow potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its silver-gray foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and has a compact, bushy habit. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs, which help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to cold, alpine environments and is often found in rocky soils at high elevations.</p>
