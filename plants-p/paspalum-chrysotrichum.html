<p>Paspalum chrysotrichum, commonly known as golden paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and produces small, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Paspalum chrysotrichum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects.</p>
