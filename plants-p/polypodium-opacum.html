<p>Polypodium opacum, commonly known as the pale polypody, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
