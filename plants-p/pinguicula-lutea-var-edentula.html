<p>Pinguicula lutea var. edentula, commonly known as the yellow butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and lack teeth, giving it its scientific name "edentula.".</p>
