<p>Poecilostachys geminata, commonly known as the twin-stemmed grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typically with two to three flowers per spikelet. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Poecilostachys geminata is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
