                    <h1>Pseudocyclosorus ochthodes var. palniensis</h1>
<p>Pseudocyclosorus ochthodes var. palniensis, commonly known as the Palni hill fern, is a rare variant of the genus Pseudocyclosorus.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically 30â€“50 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the mountainous regions of southern India. Its spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, this variant is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists studying fern diversity.</p>
