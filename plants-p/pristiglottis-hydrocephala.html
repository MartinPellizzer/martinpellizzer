                    <h1>Pristiglottis hydrocephala</h1>
<p>Pristiglottis hydrocephala, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that resemble the spokes of a wheel, hence its common name. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in wetlands and rice paddies. Its submerged leaves are thin and ribbon-like, adapted for efficient light absorption in water.</p>
<p>Pristiglottis hydrocephala plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water oxygenation.</p>
