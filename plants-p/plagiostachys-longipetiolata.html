<p>Plagiostachys longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled arrowhead, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often bright green and have long petioles, allowing them to float on the water's surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, enabling it to form dense mats that provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Plagiostachys longipetiolata is valued in ornamental water gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
