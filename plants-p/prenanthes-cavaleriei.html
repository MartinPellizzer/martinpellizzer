                    <h1>Prenanthes cavaleriei</h1>
<p>Prenanthes cavaleriei, commonly known as the Cavalerie's bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its unique, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are submerged, while its flowers emerge above the water surface, often in a spadix surrounded by a spathe.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
