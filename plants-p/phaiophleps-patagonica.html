<p>Phaiophleps patagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in cold, humid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a tight, often colorful covering on rock surfaces. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is typically found in high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Patagonia.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered an indicator species for environmental health and stability.</p>
