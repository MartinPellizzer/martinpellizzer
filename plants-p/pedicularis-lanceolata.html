<p>Pedicularis lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf lousewort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from the roots of host plants. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple, and it thrives in cool, moist environments such as alpine meadows and forested areas.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
