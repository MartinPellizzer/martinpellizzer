<p>Pimpinella saxifraga subsp.</p>
<p>dissecta, commonly known as the dissected cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species.</p>
