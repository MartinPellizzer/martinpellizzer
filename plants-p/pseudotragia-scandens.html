<p>Pseudotragia scandens, commonly known as the climbing false tragus, is a woody vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features opposite, elliptical leaves with slightly serrated edges and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to climb using tendrils, making it a common sight in shaded, humid environments. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Pseudotragia scandens is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
