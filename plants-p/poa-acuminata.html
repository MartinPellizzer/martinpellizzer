                    <h1>Poa acuminata</h1>
<p>Poa acuminata, commonly known as slender meadow grass, is a cool-season grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, slender blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue-gray florets. Its rhizomatous and stolonal growth allows it to spread and colonize open areas effectively.</p>
<p>Poa acuminata is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks, contributing to soil stabilization and ecological diversity.</p>
