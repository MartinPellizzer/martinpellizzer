                    <h1>Pinus monstrosa var. hendersonii</h1>
<p>Pinus monstrosa var. hendersonii, commonly known as the Henderson's twisted pine, is a rare and striking variant of the Monterey pine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its highly contorted, gnarled trunk and branches, which give it a distinctive, almost sculptural appearance. This variety thrives in coastal environments with mild, wet winters and dry summers, typical of its native range in California. Its foliage consists of short, needle-like leaves that are dark green and evergreen, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts for its visual appeal.</p>
