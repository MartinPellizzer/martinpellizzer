                    <h1>Paspalum lacustre</h1>
<p>Paspalum lacustre, commonly known as water paspalum, is a perennial grass native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist to aquatic habitats, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, spreading stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce minute flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Paspalum lacustre plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
