                    <h1>Potentilla rupestris proles villosa</h1>
<p>Potentilla rupestris proles villosa, commonly known as the woolly sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy habitats in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with wiry, often hairy stems that help it anchor in loose, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its characteristic "woolly" appearance.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in alpine or coastal regions.</p>
