                    <h1>Pleione sparsa</h1>
<p>Pleione sparsa, commonly known as the sparse pleione, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the high altitudes of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, pale yellow to orange flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on forest floors or rocky substrates. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces a single flower per stem during the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pleione sparsa is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
