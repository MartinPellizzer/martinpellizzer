                    <h1>Potentilla incana var. arenicola</h1>
<p>Potentilla incana var. arenicola, commonly known as sand buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well adapted to dry conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
