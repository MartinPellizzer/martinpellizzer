<p>Presliophytum arequipense, commonly known as the Arequipa cactus, is a unique succulent native to the high-altitude regions of southern Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, spiny stems that store water efficiently. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its flowers, which are usually yellow or orange, bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
