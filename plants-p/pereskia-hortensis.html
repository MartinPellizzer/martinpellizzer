                    <h1>Pereskia hortensis</h1>
<p>Pereskia hortensis, commonly known as the ornamental cactus or Christmas cactus, is a unique succulent plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often mistaken for leaves, which are actually modified stems. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically during the winter months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish.</p>
<p>Despite its cactus-like appearance, it is not a true cactus but belongs to the Cactaceae family.</p>
