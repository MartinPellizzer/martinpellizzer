                    <h1>Potamogeton × leptocephalus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × leptocephalus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant that occurs naturally in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide, often with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically emerging from the water surface. It is commonly found in shallow lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams, where it can form dense underwater vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
