<p>Picea excelsa f. balcanica, commonly known as the Balkan white fir, is a rare subspecies of the white fir native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender form and conical crown, with needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist mountain environments, often at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its cones are usually pendulous and contain small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
