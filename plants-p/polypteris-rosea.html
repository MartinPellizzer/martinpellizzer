                    <h1>Polypteris rosea</h1>
<p>Polypteris rosea, commonly known as the rose fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are pinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a soft, ornamental appearance.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid, tropical climates.</p>
