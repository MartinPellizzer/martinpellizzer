                    <h1>Phelypaea ramosa var. brevispicata</h1>
<p>Phelypaea ramosa var. brevispicata, commonly known as the short-spined waterwheel plant, is a species of aquatic fern characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a whorl around the stem, giving it a distinctive waterwheel appearance. The plant thrives in shallow, still freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands, where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. Its small, spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more robust spines compared to other varieties of Phelypaea ramosa.</p>
