                    <h1>Pedicularis groenlandica f. pallida</h1>
<p>Pedicularis groenlandica f. pallida, commonly known as the pale lady's mantle, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, deriving some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>This unique botanical form is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme climatic conditions.</p>
