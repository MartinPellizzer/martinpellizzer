                    <h1>Potentilla palustris f. subglabra</h1>
<p>Potentilla palustris f. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that are glabrous, meaning they lack hairs, giving it a smooth texture. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptical, and often covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to moist soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed wetlands.</p>
