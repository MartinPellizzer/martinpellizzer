                    <h1>Patagonium glaucum</h1>
<p>Patagonium glaucum, commonly known as the Patagonian bluebush, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-green foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Patagonium glaucum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
