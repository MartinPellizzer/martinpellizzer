<p>Poa bergiana, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, Poa bergiana is often cultivated in gardens and used for soil stabilization in mountainous areas.</p>
