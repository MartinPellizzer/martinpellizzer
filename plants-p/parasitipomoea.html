<p>Parasitipomoea, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Convolvulaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are hemiparasitic, meaning they derive some nutrients from their host plants while also performing photosynthesis. They typically have showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are often blue or purple in color. The leaves are usually alternate and can be heart-shaped or ovate.</p>
<p>Parasitipomoea species are found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in association with other plants in forested areas.</p>
