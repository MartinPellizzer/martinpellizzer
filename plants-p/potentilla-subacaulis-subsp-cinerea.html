                    <h1>Potentilla subacaulis subsp. cinerea</h1>
<p>Potentilla subacaulis subsp.</p>
<p>cinerea, commonly known as the gray cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine hairs, and its showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically forms dense mats or cushions, adapting to harsh alpine or subalpine environments. It has small, palmately divided leaves and produces fruiting structures called achenes, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky soils.</p>
