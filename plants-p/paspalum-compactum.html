<p>Paspalum compactum, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is highly salt-tolerant and thrives in sandy or coastal soils, making it well-suited for erosion control in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Paspalum compactum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
