                    <h1>Polypodium fossum</h1>
<p>Polypodium fossum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a yellowish hue. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in moist, forested habitats.</p>
