<p>Fire pink, scientifically known as Pyrolirion xiphopetalum, is a strikingly colorful plant that captivates with its vivid red blooms. Native to the mountainous regions of western North America, it thrives in rocky and dry environments. This perennial plant is admired for its ability to flourish in challenging conditions, making it a hardy choice for gardeners. Its flowers, which resemble tiny flames, bloom in late spring and early summer, adding a dramatic touch to the landscape. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively obscure, often overshadowed by more common garden plants.</p>
