<p>Picea likiangensis var. bhutanica, commonly known as the Bhutan fir, is a rare coniferous tree native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist mountainous environments at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
