                    <h1>Phagnalon geminiflorum var. tenorei</h1>
<p>Phagnalon geminiflorum var. tenorei, commonly known as the coastal phagnalon, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, creeping stems that form dense mats. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in the salty, windy coastal environment.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in sandy soils and is an important component of coastal vegetation communities.</p>
