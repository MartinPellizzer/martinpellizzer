<p>Plantago scariosa, commonly known as the scarlet plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, three-lobed capsule that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is valued for its medicinal properties.</p>
