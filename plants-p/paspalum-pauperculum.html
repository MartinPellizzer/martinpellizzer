<p>Paspalum pauperculum, commonly known as the poor grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to grow in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
