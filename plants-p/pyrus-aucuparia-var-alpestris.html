<p>Pyrus aucuparia var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a hedging plant in colder climates.</p>
