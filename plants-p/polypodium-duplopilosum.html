<p>Polypodium duplopilosum, commonly known as the double-hair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive double row of tiny, hair-like structures along the leaf margins. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Polypodium duplopilosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
