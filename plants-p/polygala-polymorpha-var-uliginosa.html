                    <h1>Polygala polymorpha var. uliginosa</h1>
<p>Polygala polymorpha var. uliginosa, commonly known as the bog milkvetch, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshy or boggy areas, where it thrives in poorly drained, acidic soils. The plant features slender, often hairy stems that bear small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or purple. Its leaves are alternate and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
