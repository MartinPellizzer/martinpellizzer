                    <h1>Pothos auritus</h1>
<p>Pothos auritus, commonly known as the "earleaf philodendron," is a tropical vine native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that have a distinctive ear-like protrusion on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is primarily grown for its foliage rather than its blooms. Its trailing growth habit makes it popular as a houseplant, and it thrives in bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Pothos auritus is relatively low maintenance, requiring moderate watering and well-draining soil.</p>
