<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and a long, spiraled inflorescence of small, white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires a specific mycorrhizal association for nutrient uptake. It blooms in late summer, producing a fragrant, delicate floral display.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a threatened species in many regions.</p>
