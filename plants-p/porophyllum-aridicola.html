                    <h1>Porophyllum aridicola</h1>
<p>Porophyllum aridicola, commonly known as the desert lettuce, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy, succulent leaves. The plant has a rosette growth form, allowing it to conserve water in its harsh environment. Its leaves are typically gray-green due to a dense covering of trichomes, which reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Porophyllum aridicola produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
