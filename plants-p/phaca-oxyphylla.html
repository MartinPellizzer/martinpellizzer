                    <h1>Phaca oxyphylla</h1>
<p>Phaca oxyphylla, commonly known as the sharp-leafed phaca, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is characterized by its linear, sharply pointed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Phaca oxyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
