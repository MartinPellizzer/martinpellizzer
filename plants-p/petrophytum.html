                    <h1>Petrophytum</h1>
<p>Petrophytum, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its root system is shallow and adapted to quickly absorb moisture from infrequent rainfalls.</p>
<p>Petrophytum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various desert animals.</p>
