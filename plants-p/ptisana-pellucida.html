                <h1>Ptisana pellucida</h1>
<p>Ptisana pellucida, commonly known as the translucent grass or ghost grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Ptisana pellucida is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, exhibiting succulence in its leaves to store water.</p>
<p>It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine by local communities.</p>
