<p>Poa kronokensis, commonly known as the KÃ¥reland bluegrass, is a species of grass native to the Nordic region, particularly Sweden.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and a bluish-green coloration due to its high chlorophyll content. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, compact flower clusters typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>Poa kronokensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native environment.</p>
