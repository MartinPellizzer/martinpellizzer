<p>Pinus yecorensis, commonly known as the Yecora pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are often covered in a sticky resin, which helps in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>The Yecora pine plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
