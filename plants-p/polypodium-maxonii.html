<p>Polypodium maxonii, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread vegetatively. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving them a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Polypodium maxonii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
