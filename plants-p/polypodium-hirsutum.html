<p>Polypodium hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The fronds are divided into segments, with the upper part often forming a dense, shield-like shape.</p>
