<p>Phlegmariurus juniperistachyus, commonly known as the juniper-stalked clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or acidic soils. The plant produces sporophytes that bear microsporangia and megasporangia, typical of its lycophyte classification. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
