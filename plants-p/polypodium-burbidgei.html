<p>Polypodium burbidgei, commonly known as the Burbidge's hart's-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that resemble the shape of a hart's tongue, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, thriving in humid conditions. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are divided into narrow, leathery segments that remain attached to the plant for several years.</p>
