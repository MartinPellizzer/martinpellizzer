                    <h1>Potentilla adenophylla</h1>
<p>Potentilla adenophylla, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations.</p>
<p>Potentilla adenophylla thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or steppe habitats.</p>
