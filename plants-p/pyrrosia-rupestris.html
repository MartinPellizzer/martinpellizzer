                    <h1>Pyrrosia rupestris</h1>
<p>Pyrrosia rupestris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rock surfaces or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Pyrrosia rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
