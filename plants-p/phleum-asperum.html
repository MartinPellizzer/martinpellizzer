<p>Phleum asperum, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in rocky or disturbed soils. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences with small, two-lobed florets, which are typically green to purplish in color. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy choice for landscaping and erosion control.</p>
<p>Its ecological value includes providing food for grazing animals and supporting pollinators.</p>
