<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, dry soils. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its adaptation to harsh desert environments.</p>
