<p>Pandanus aquaticus, commonly known as the water pandanus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and coastal areas, where it can tolerate brackish water conditions. Its roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in these habitats.</p>
