                    <h1>Pilea muscosa var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Pilea muscosa var. microphylla, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are smaller than those of the standard Pilea muscosa, giving it a more delicate appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care.</p>
