                    <h1>Polygonum japonicum var. densiflorum</h1>
<p>Polygonum japonicum var. densiflorum, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread rapidly and aggressively. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in urban environments.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a problematic weed in many regions.</p>
