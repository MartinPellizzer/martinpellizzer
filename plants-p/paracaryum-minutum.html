<p>Paracaryum minutum, commonly known as the dwarf water lily, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are usually less than 5 centimeters in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its flowers are small and pale yellow, blooming in the early morning and closing by midday.</p>
<p>Paracaryum minutum plays a role in providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributes to water clarity by absorbing nutrients.</p>
