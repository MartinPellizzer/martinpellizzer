<p>Panax ginseng f. xanthocarpus, commonly known as yellow-fruited ginseng, is a rare and less commonly cultivated variant of the ginseng plant.</p>

The plant belongs to the Araliaceae family and is native to specific regions in China, Korea, and Russia. Its botanical features include a multi-branched root system and lanceolate leaves with a serrated margin.</p>
<p>This form is valued in traditional medicine for its purported adaptogenic and tonic properties.</p>
