                    <h1>Phalangium virgatum</h1>
<p>Phalangium virgatum, commonly known as the slender centipede plant, is a unique species of flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. It has a creeping growth habit, with stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground.</p>
<p>Despite its name, it is not related to centipedes but is named for its segmented appearance.</p>
