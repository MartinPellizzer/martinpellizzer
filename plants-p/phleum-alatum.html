<p>Phleum alatum, commonly known as silver grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-blue foliage, which results from dense pubescence on the leaf blades. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, cylindrical spikelets that form panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Phleum alatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
