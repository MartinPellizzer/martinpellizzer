<p>Panicum barbivaginale, commonly known as the hairy beardgrass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, hairy inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered, producing lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
