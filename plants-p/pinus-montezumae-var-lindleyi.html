                    <h1>Pinus montezumae var. lindleyi</h1>
<p>Pinus montezumae var. lindleyi, commonly known as the Lindley's Mexican pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the high-altitude regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The cones of this variety are woody and can persist on the tree for several years before opening. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
