<p>Pityrogramma elongata, commonly known as the long-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to spread and colonize wetlands and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are usually elongated and have a lanceolate shape, with a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>Pityrogramma elongata plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
