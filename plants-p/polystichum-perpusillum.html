<p>Polystichum perpusillum, commonly known as the dwarf fern or the miniature shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that form a rounded, mat-like growth pattern. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its fronds are deeply divided, with a feathery appearance, and they maintain their green color throughout the year.</p>
<p>Polystichum perpusillum thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
