The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in cloud forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its host and absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Polypodium bonplandii is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
