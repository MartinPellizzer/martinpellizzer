                    <h1>Pinguicula caerulea f. leucantha</h1>
<p>Pinguicula caerulea f. leucantha, commonly known as the white-leaved butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small insects. The leaves are typically pale green to white in color, which distinguishes this form from the more commonly known blue-leaved variety. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wet meadows.</p>
<p>This plant is popular among carnivorous plant enthusiasts for its unique appearance and specialized adaptations.</p>
