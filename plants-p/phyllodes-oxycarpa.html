                    <h1>Phyllodes oxycarpa</h1>
<p>Phyllodes oxycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wattle, is a species of acacia native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow phyllodes that are often curved and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are grouped into cylindrical spikes. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>The phyllodes are modified leaves that serve as the primary photosynthetic structures, reducing water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
