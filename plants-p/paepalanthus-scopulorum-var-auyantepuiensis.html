<p>Paepalanthus scopulorum var. auyantepuiensis, commonly known as the Angel's Tears plant, is a rare bromeliad native to the tepuis of Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, drooping inflorescences that resemble tears, often in shades of pink and red. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires high humidity and indirect light. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, forming a rosette structure that holds water.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
