                    <h1>Phaseolus lathyroides f. chacoensis</h1>
<p>Phaseolus lathyroides f. chacoensis, commonly known as the Chaco runner bean, is a wild legume native to South America, particularly the Chaco region of Paraguay and northern Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit, trifoliate leaves, and elongated, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and efficient water use. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces a modest yield of seeds that are sometimes used in traditional cuisines.</p>
<p>This species is of interest for its potential in agricultural breeding programs due to its resilience and genetic diversity.</p>
