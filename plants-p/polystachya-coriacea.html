                    <h1>Polystachya coriacea</h1>
<p>Polystachya coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leafed ginger, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stiff, coriaceous leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitats. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is cultivated in some botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
