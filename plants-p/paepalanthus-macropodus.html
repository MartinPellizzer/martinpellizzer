                    <h1>Paepalanthus macropodus</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus macropodus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. The plant's flowers are typically white or pink, with a distinctive, showy structure that attracts pollinators such as beetles and flies. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Paepalanthus macropodus plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water quality through oxygenation.</p>
