<p>Paullinia dentata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually alternate and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Paullinia dentata thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and ornamental contexts.</p>
