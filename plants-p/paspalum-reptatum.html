<p>Paspalum reptatum, commonly known as匍匐 grass or creeping paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with rhizomes that allow it to form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in wet or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Paspalum reptatum is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid spread and ability to colonize new areas.</p>
