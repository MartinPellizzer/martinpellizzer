<p>Pterostylis macrocalymma, commonly known as the large-calyx spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features a slender, leafless stem that produces a single, showy, spider-like flower with a distinctive greenish-yellow hue. The plant has a short, fibrous root system and is often found in open heathlands or dry grassy areas. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly thrips, which are attracted to the nectar-rich structure.</p>
<p>The orchid is known for its unique morphology and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
