<p>Polypodium laevigatum, commonly known as the smooth holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas.</p>
