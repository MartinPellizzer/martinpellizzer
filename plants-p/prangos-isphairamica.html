<p>Prangos isphairamica, commonly known as the desert thistle, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces spiny, woolly stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Prangos isphairamica is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
