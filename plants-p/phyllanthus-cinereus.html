                    <h1>Phyllanthus cinereus</h1>
<p>Phyllanthus cinereus, commonly known as the ash-leaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its grayish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, dusty appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, often blooming during the dry season. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny capsule, which aids in dispersal by animals or through mechanical means.</p>
<p>Phyllanthus cinereus is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots and succulent leaves that store water.</p>
