<p>Polygonum lencoranicum, commonly known as the Lencoranic knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive nodes and often triangular stems. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain areas.</p>
