                    <h1>Pogonia japonica f. lineariperiantha</h1>
<p>Pogonia japonica f. lineariperiantha, commonly known as the Japanese twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant is typically found in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its linear, narrow leaves are adapted to maximize light absorption in low-light environments.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its elongated perianth and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
