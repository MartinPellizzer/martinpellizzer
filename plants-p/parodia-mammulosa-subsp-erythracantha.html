<p>Parodia mammulosa subsp.</p>
<p>erythracantha, commonly known as the red-spined cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to southern Africa. It features a ribbed stem with prominent, red-tinged spines that give it its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne in the axils of the ribs. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions.</p>
