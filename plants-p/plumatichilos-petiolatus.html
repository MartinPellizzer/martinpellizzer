<p>Plumatichilos petiolatus, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often glandular. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense, terminal spike, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
