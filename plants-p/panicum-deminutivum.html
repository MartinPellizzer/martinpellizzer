                    <h1>Panicum deminutivum</h1>
<p>Panicum deminutivum, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a small annual grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of less than 10 inches and has slender, spreading stems covered in fine, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of pale green to yellowish flowers, which are often mistaken for seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and along creek banks.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and rapid growth cycle, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
