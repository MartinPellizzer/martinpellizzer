                    <h1>Pitcairnia oblongifolia</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia oblongifolia, commonly known as the "Beware of the Dog" plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears vibrant, long-lasting orange-red flowers. The plant's rosette of narrow, waxy leaves forms a water-holding cup, which supports a unique ecosystem for small organisms. It thrives in shady, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is a symbol of the biodiversity of the Brazilian rainforest.</p>
