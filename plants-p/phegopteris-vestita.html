<p>Phegopteris vestita, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Islands and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns.</p>
<p>Phegopteris vestita plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability.</p>
