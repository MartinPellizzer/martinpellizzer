                    <h1>Pitcairnia maritima</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia maritima, commonly known as the sea pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to coastal regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a feature common among bromeliads. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its flowers, which are typically pink or purple, bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability to coastal conditions, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
