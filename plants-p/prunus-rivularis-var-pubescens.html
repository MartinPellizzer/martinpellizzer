                    <h1>Prunus rivularis var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Prunus rivularis var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy river cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and alternate, ovate leaves that are hairy on both surfaces. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, followed by edible, cherry-like fruits that are yellow when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found along riverbanks and in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
