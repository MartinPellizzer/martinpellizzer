                    <h1>Pedicularis baumgartenii</h1>
<p>Pedicularis baumgartenii, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the alpine regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded shape, typical of the genus Pedicularis. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
