                    <h1>Ptilotus barkeri</h1>
<p>Ptilotus barkeri, commonly known as the sandbur or desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, ball-like seed heads that disperse seeds via wind. The plant has small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Ptilotus barkeri is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
