<p>Peteniodendron estoriense, commonly known as the Estoriense Tree, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the humid lowland forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and aromatic resinous bark. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern with a broad, spreading canopy and woody, fibrous roots that anchor it firmly in the rich, moist soil. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-yellow in color, while its fruits are spherical and contain a single seed.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Peteniodendron estoriense is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
