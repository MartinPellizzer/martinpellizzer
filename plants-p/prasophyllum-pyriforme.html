                    <h1>Prasophyllum pyriforme</h1>
<p>Prasophyllum pyriforme, commonly known as the yellow fairy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as heathlands and grasslands. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf and a spike of up to 20 yellow or greenish-yellow flowers. Its flowers are resupinate, meaning they are twisted so that the lip faces backward, a characteristic common in many orchid species.</p>
<p>Prasophyllum pyriforme is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor environments and is often found in coastal regions.</p>
