<p>Pyrola reticulata, commonly known as the netted wintergreen, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its leathery, elliptic leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils under shaded conditions.</p>
<p>Pyrola reticulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to bloom in cool climates.</p>
