<p>Pereskia spathulata, commonly known as the flat-leaf cactus, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically oval and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Pereskia spathulata is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
