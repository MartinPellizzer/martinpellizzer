<p>Pandanus horridus, commonly known as the rough pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many pandanus species. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional basket weaving.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near coastal areas or in humid lowland regions.</p>
