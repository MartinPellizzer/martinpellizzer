                    <h1>Polystichum × kasayamense</h1>
<p>Polystichum × kasayamense, commonly known as the hybrid Japanese forest fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Polystichum setiferum and Polystichum hirtum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas across Japan.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
