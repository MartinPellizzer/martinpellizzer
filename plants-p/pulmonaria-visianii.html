<p>Pulmonaria visianii, commonly known as the Visianii Lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spotted leaves that resemble lung tissue, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland environments and is often found in calcareous soils.</p>
<p>Pulmonaria visianii is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and early blooming habit.</p>
