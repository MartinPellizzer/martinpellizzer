                    <h1>Puya guianensis</h1>
<p>Puya guianensis, commonly known as the giant puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can reach up to 10 meters in height, making it one of the tallest flowering plants in the world. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bats. Its rosette of broad, sword-shaped leaves forms a water-holding structure, which supports its unique ecological role in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Puya guianensis is also notable for its ability to survive in shaded environments, contributing to its success in dense forest understories.</p>
