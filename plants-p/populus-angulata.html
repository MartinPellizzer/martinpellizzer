                    <h1>Populus angulata</h1>
<p>Populus angulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller and more pointed than those of other poplar species. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Populus angulata is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
