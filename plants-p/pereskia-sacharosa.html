                    <h1>Pereskia sacharosa</h1>
<p>Pereskia sacharosa, commonly known as the sugar bush, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, a typical adaptation to arid environments. The plant has large, waxy leaves that are often mistaken for true leaves, as it lacks the typical succulent foliage seen in many cacti. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, appearing in clusters and attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Pereskia sacharosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
