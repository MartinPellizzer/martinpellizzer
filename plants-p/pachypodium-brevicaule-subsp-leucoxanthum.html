<p>Pachypodium brevicaule subsp.</p>
<p>leucoxanthum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered pachypodium, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, and its spiny, branching structure.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the dry season, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature adapted to minimize water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is well-suited to rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun.</p>
