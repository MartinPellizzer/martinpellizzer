                    <h1>Polypodium piloselloides</h1>
<p>Polypodium piloselloides, commonly known as the silky cliff fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are covered in a dense layer of soft, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in shaded, moist environments, thriving in acidic soils. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, fibrous sheath, which helps anchor it to its substrate.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
