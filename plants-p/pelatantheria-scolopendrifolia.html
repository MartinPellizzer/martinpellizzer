<p>Pelatantheria scolopendrifolia, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves and produces intricate, spider-like flowers in shades of white and purple. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection.</p>
