                    <h1>Poa × multnomae</h1>
<p>Poa × multnomae, commonly known as the hybrid bluegrass, is a sterile grass species resulting from the cross between Poa annua and Poa pratensis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green, bluish-gray foliage. The plant typically forms dense, low-growing sods and is often found in moist, temperate environments. While it does not produce viable seeds, it is frequently used in turfgrass mixtures for its durability and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic bridge between two economically important grass species.</p>
