                    <h1>Pitcairnia albolutea</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia albolutea, commonly known as the white-flowered pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a common adaptation among bromeliads. The plant produces striking white or pale blue flowers that bloom in a spike, adding visual interest to its foliage. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia albolutea is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
