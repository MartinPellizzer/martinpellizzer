<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, green stems and sparse, spiny foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rains.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments.</p>
