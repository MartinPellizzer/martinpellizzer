<p>Polystichum kungianum, commonly known as the Kung's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright fronds with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes.
