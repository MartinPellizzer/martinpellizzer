<p>Pleopeltis renifera, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often lobed and have a velvety texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Pleopeltis renifera is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in tropical forest ecosystems.</p>
