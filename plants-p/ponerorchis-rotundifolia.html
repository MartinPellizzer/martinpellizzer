<p>It is characterized by its small, rosette-like growth habit and distinctive, rounded leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a unique, spurred lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
