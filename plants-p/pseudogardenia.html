                    <h1>Pseudogardenia</h1>
<p>Pseudogardenia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying solely on its roots for sustenance. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Pseudogardenia thrives in wet, acidic pine flatwoods and is often found growing on the trunks of trees.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining population, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
