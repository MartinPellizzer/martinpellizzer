<p>Bluegrasses, scientifically known as Pseudoroegneria setulifera, are a type of cool-season grass native to the northern regions of North America. This hardy plant is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks, thriving in well-drained soils. With its fine, dark green blades and tufted growth habit, it adds a soft texture to natural landscapes. Bluegrasses are valued for their drought tolerance and ability to form dense, low-maintenance turf. Its ecological importance includes supporting wildlife and preventing soil erosion in diverse environments.</p>
