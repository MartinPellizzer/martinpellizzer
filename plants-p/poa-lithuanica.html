                    <h1>Poa lithuanica</h1>
<p>Poa lithuanica, commonly known as the Lithuanian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Poa lithuanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in natural habitats.</p>
