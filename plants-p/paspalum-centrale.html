                    <h1>Paspalum centrale</h1>
<p>Paspalum centrale, commonly known as Florida grass or coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and forms dense, low-growing turf, often found in coastal areas and wetlands. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and establish quickly in disturbed or moist soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly rolled, with a bluish-green coloration.</p>
<p>Paspalum centrale is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is often used in restoration projects along shorelines.</p>
