                    <h1>Paepalanthus polyanthus var. tomentosa</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus polyanthus var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly pincushion cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of spiny stems covered in a thick, white, woolly coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a subtle ornamental touch. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
