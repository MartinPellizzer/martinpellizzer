                    <h1>Phleum dactylon</h1>
<p>Phleum dactylon, commonly known as couch grass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread aggressively and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Couch grass is commonly found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
