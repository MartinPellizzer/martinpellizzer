<p>Pedicularis macrochila, commonly known as the large-flowered lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots often form symbiotic relationships with fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
