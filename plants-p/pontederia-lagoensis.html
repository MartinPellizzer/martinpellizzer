<p>Pontederia lagoensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water hyacinth, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, supported by spongy, air-filled stems. Its striking violet-blue flowers bloom in dense clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
