                    <h1>Plantago australis</h1>
<p>Plantago australis, commonly known as the common plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spike, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread easily and colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures.</p>
