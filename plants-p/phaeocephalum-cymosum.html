                    <h1>Phaeocephalum cymosum</h1>
<p>Phaeocephalum cymosum, commonly known as the clustered mossy cushion, is a low-growing plant that thrives in arctic and alpine environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it withstand harsh climatic conditions. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are typically covered in a thick layer of moss, providing insulation and moisture retention. It reproduces through spores, which are released from cup-like structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting microbial life in extreme habitats.</p>
