                    <h1>Phthirusa iodocarpa</h1>
<p>Phthirusa iodocarpa, commonly known as the iodine-bearing cactus, is a unique species native to specific arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent stems and clusters of small, spiny leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its name derives from the presence of iodine in its tissues, which is rare among succulents.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to harsh environments, storing water in its thick stems and minimizing water loss through its protective spines.</p>
