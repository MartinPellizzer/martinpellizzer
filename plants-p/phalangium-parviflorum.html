                    <h1>Phalangium parviflorum</h1>
<p>Phalangium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered phalangium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it competes with other shade-tolerant flora. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its unique botanical appearance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Phalangium parviflorum is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
