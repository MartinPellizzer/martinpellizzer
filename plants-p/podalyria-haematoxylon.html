                    <h1>Podalyria haematoxylon</h1>
<p>Podalyria haematoxylon, commonly known as the Indian red sanders, is a small evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of India and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green. The plant is most notable for its heartwood, which is rich in a red dye called haematoxylon, used historically for coloring textiles and body paint. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained soils with minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
