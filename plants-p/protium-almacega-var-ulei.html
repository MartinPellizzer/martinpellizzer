                    <h1>Protium almacega var. ulei</h1>
<p>Protium almacega var. ulei, commonly known as the Brazilian mahogany, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its large, simple leaves that are alternate and often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed.</p>
<p>Its bark and wood have historically been valued for their durability and fine grain, though overharvesting has led to conservation concerns.</p>
