<p>Psephellus vanensis, commonly known as the Vanuatu rock orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the island of Vanuatu in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, showy flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliff faces or in crevices. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, which play a crucial role in its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Psephellus vanensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
