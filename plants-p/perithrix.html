                    <h1>Perithrix</h1>
<p>Perithrix, commonly known as the "ghost plant," is a unique member of the liverwort family (Marchantiophyta).</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in damp soil or on decaying wood. Its structure consists of a thallus, which is a leaf-like structure with a central strand of cells. Perithrix lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead relies on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>This plant plays a vital role in nutrient cycling in its ecosystem.</p>
