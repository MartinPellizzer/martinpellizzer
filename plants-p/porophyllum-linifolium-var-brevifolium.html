The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-gray, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun.</p>
