<p>Phelypaea albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense underwater colonies. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and often float on the water surface. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it relies on spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Phelypaea albiflora plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
