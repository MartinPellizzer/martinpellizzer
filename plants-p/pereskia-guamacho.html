                    <h1>Pereskia guamacho</h1>
<p>Pereskia guamacho, commonly known as the Guamacho cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, woody stems that are covered with a layer of pale green bark, resembling a tree rather than a typical cactus. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Pereskia guamacho is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
