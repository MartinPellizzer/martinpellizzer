<p>Poa annua var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the fuzzy annual bluegrass, is a cool-season grass that thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, soft blades covered in a dense layer of hairs, giving it a velvety texture. This variety is often found in lawns, golf courses, and disturbed soils due to its rapid growth and adaptability. It produces small, blue-green seed heads that are distinctive in appearance.</p>
<p>While it is a common weed in turfgrass, it also has ornamental value in certain garden settings.</p>
