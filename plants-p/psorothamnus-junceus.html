<p>Psorothamnus junceus, commonly known as desert flax, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, needle-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. Its foliage is often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Psorothamnus junceus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
