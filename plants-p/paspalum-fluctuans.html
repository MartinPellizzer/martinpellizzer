                    <h1>Paspalum fluctuans</h1>
<p>Paspalum fluctuans, commonly known as the floating grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and the edges of ponds, where it can float on the water's surface. Its leaves are narrow and often form dense mats, which help in stabilizing the soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Paspalum fluctuans is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through vegetative propagation, making it both a useful ecological plant and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
