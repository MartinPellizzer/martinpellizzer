<p>Parathelypteris petiolulata, commonly known as the slender frilled fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frilled fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a network of roots that help anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually lance-shaped with a serrated margin, and the sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
