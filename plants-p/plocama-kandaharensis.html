<p>Plocama kandaharensis, commonly known as the Kandahar bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptation to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Plocama kandaharensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
