                    <h1>Pisum sativum var. indehiscens</h1>
<p>Pisum sativum var. indehiscens, commonly known as the runner bean, is a variant of the common pea that features pods that do not open naturally.</p>
<p>This trait is due to a genetic mutation that prevents the pod from splitting, which can be advantageous for seed retention and harvest. The plant is a climbing legume with compound leaves and small, white or pink flowers. It produces edible pods that contain seeds, often used in culinary applications.</p>
<p>This variety is cultivated for its nutritious beans and is well-suited to temperate climates.</p>
