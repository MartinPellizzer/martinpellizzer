<p>It has small, opposite leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. Its berries are red and fleshy, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of forest canopies.</p>
