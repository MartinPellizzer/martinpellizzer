<p>Pedicularis longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often at high elevations. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of showy, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees, and the plant is often found in association with other alpine flora.</p>
<p>Pedicularis longiflora is also notable for its parasitic nature, drawing nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants.</p>
