<p>Polypodium vulgare subsp.</p>
<p>mantoniae, commonly known as the Mantonia fern, is a fern species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizome is creeping and produces a dense network of roots that help anchor it in soil.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
