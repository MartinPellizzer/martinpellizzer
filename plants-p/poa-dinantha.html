<p>Poa dinantha, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along streambanks. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets.</p>
<p>Poa dinantha plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
