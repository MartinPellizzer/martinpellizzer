<p>Pseudoprosopis gilletii, commonly known as the desert shrub or creosotebush, is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its woody stems and ability to resprout after fire make it a resilient species in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Pseudoprosopis gilletii plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
