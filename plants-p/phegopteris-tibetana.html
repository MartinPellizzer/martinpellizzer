<p>Phegopteris tibetana, commonly known as the Tibetan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to high-altitude regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as mountain lakes and streams. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it in the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Phegopteris tibetana plays a crucial ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality regulation.</p>
