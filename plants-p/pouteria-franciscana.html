                    <h1>Pouteria franciscana</h1>
<p>Pouteria franciscana, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody pods containing multiple seeds. The tree can grow up to 50 meters tall and has a dense, buttressed root system that helps it thrive in the humid, nutrient-poor soils of the rainforest. Its fruit is economically important for its edible seeds, which are harvested for their rich oil content and are a key component of the Brazil nut trade.</p>
<p>The species also plays a vital ecological role in supporting diverse wildlife within its native habitat.</p>
