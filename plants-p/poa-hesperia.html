                    <h1>Poa hesperia</h1>
<p>Poa hesperia, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial plant that thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue-green flowers that bloom in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Poa hesperia is valued for its ecological role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for various alpine species.</p>
