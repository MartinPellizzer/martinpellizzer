<p>Phegopteris asterothrix, commonly known as the star-veined water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often adorned with distinctive star-shaped patterns on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates such as rocks or soil.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
