<p>Polypodium vulgare var. commune, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive U-shaped sori on the underside of the leaves. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are deciduous, dying back in winter and regrowing in the spring.</p>
