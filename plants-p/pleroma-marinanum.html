<p>Pleroma marinanum, commonly known as the coastal pleroma, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Pleroma marinanum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
