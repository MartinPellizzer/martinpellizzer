<p>Pachysandra axillaris subsp.</p>
<p>axillaris, commonly known as the creeping pachysandra, is a low-growing evergreen groundcover native to southern China. It features glossy, dark green, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, mat-like growth habit.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late spring, followed by black berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its dense foliage and ability to suppress weeds.</p>
<p>Its hardiness makes it a popular choice for woodland gardens and shaded rockeries.</p>
