<p>Polybotrya articulata, commonly known as the articulated polypody, is a fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its unique morphology.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its segmented stems, which give it its common name.</p>
