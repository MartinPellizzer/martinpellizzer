<p>Phlebiophragmus macrorhizus var. meyenii, commonly known as the giant root lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a thick, leathery thallus with a deep green to brown coloration, often featuring distinct lobes and a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide photosynthetic capabilities, while the fungal component absorbs water and nutrients. It is typically found on decaying wood or stone in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and unique morphology make it a notable species in ecological studies.</p>
