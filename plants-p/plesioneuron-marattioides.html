<p>Plesioneuron marattioides, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large fern belonging to the family Cyatheaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, tree-like trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a long, fibrous root system that helps anchor it in moist soils.</p>
<p>Its spore-bearing structures, called sorangia, are located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
