<p>Pycreus intactus, commonly known as the desert star cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed structure that helps it store water efficiently in its succulent stems. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are modified into spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Overall, Pycreus intactus is well adapted to harsh desert environments, showcasing remarkable resilience and unique botanical features.</p>
