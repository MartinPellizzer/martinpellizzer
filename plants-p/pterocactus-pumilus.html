                    <h1>Pterocactus pumilus</h1>
<p>Pterocactus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf pterocactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem that is often covered in a dense layer of white, powdery wax, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a delicate touch of color to its otherwise desolate habitat. It is well adapted to extreme drought conditions and thrives in full sun with minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping in dry climates.</p>
