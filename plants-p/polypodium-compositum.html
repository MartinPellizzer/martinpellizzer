<p>Polypodium compositum, commonly known as the composite fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are divided into numerous small, finger-like segments. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in shaded, moist environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Polypodium compositum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
