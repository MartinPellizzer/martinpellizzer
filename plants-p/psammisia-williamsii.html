                    <h1>Psammisia williamsii</h1>
<p>Psammisia williamsii, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its succulent leaves and deep root system. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to thrive with minimal water and maintenance.</p>
<p>Psammisia williamsii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
