<p>Pediocactus parviflorus subsp.</p>
<p>terrae-canyonae, commonly known as the Terrae-Canyon Hedgehog Cactus, is a compact, spiny cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It features short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
