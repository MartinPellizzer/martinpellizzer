                    <h1>Platanthera praeustipetala</h1>
<p>Platanthera praeustipetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to wetland and bog habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and requires consistent moisture.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
