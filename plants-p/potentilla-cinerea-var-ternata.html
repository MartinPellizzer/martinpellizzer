<p>Potentilla cinerea var. ternata, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, and its clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are palmately divided into five lobes, giving it a distinctive, delicate appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in the wild.</p>
