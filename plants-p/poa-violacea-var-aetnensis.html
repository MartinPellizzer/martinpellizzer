<p>Poa violacea var. aetnensis, commonly known as the Aetna violet, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass species characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and delicate, violet-blue flower heads. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment of its native habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, while its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution.</p>
