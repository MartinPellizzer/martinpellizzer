<p>Phymatosorus malabaricus, commonly known as the Malabar holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Asia, particularly India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common reproductive feature in ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing in forest understories.</p>
<p>Phymatosorus malabaricus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>
