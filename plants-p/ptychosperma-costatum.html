                    <h1>Ptychosperma costatum</h1>
<p>Ptychosperma costatum, commonly known as the mountain cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of long, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its foliage is often used in traditional practices, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
