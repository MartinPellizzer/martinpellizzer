<p>Pteris luxuriosa, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, which are covered in small, spore-producing structures called sori.</p>
<p>Pteris luxuriosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in ponds and water gardens.</p>
