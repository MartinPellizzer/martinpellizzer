                    <h1>Pyrrocoma halophila</h1>
<p>Pyrrocoma halophila, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to saline environments, with a deep root system that helps it access water in dry soils. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Pyrrocoma halophila is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate extreme conditions.</p>
