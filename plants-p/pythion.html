                    <h1>Pythion</h1>
<p>Pythion, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that resemble those of a water lily but are more fragile. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on its rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption. Pythion is often found in shaded, nutrient-rich areas of ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its ability to indicate water quality and its role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems.</p>
