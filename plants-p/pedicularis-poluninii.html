<p>Pedicularis poluninii, commonly known as the Siberian lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Siberia and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
