<p>Pilosella kalksburgensis subsp.</p>
<p>laschii, commonly known as the Kalksburg hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
