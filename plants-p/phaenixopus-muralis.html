<p>Phaenixopus muralis, commonly known as the wall ivy, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale yellow. Its rapid growth makes it suitable for covering walls and trellises.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive if not controlled, posing a challenge in garden management.</p>
