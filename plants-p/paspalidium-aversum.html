<p>Paspalidium aversum, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, along roadsides, and in pastures.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
