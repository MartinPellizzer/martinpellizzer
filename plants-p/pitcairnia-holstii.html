                    <h1>Pitcairnia holstii</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia holstii, commonly known as the Holst's pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense rosette of long, sword-shaped, waxy leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red bracts that contrast beautifully with its green foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia holstii is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation.</p>
