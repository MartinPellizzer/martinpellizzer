                    <h1>Polygonum kotoshoense</h1>
<p>Polygonum kotoshoense, commonly known as the Japanese knotweed, is a perennial herb native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread rapidly. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple tint, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in non-native regions.</p>
