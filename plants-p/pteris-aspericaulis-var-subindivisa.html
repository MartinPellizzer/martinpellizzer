                    <h1>Pteris aspericaulis var. subindivisa</h1>
<p>Pteris aspericaulis var. subindivisa, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its serrated, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, rough-textured scales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green with a leathery texture, and they produce spore-bearing sori on the underside.</p>
