                    <h1>Phoradendron pennivenium</h1>
<p>Phoradendron pennivenium, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically red or orange, which are consumed by birds that help in seed dispersal. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Phoradendron pennivenium is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in warm, humid climates.</p>
