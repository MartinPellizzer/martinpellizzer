<p>Phalaris villosa, commonly known as hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and wet meadows. The plant features slender,丛生 stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence is a panicle composed of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
