                    <h1>Perymenium ayutlanum</h1>
<p>Perymenium ayutlanum, commonly known as the Ayutlan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees in the neotropical region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its leafless stems and small, fleshy, white berries. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while photosynthesis occurs through its scale-like structures. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for certain birds and insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
