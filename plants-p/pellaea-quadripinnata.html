                    <h1>Pellaea quadripinnata</h1>
<p>Pellaea quadripinnata, commonly known as the four-pinnate fern, is a species of fern native to the southern United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically bright green and somewhat glossy. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the ground, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat.</p>
