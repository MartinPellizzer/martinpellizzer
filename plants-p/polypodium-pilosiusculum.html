<p>Polypodium pilosiusculum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments, and the plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
