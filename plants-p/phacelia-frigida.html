                <h1>Phacelia frigida</h1>
<p>Phacelia frigida, commonly known as the alpine phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, hairy stems and produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Phacelia frigida is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in supporting local pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
