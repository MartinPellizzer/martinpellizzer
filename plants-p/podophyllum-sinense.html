                    <h1>Podophyllum sinense</h1>
<p>Podophyllum sinense, commonly known as Chinese mayapple, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features a short, stout rhizome and produces a single, umbrella-shaped leaf that is typically divided into three segments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have been historically explored, though its use is limited due to the toxicity of its parts.</p>
