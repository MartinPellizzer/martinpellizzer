                    <h1>Psoralea lanceolata var. stenostachys</h1>
<p>Psoralea lanceolata var. stenostachys, commonly known as narrow-stalked psoralea, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, trifoliate leaves with a hairy surface, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in small, leathery pods that split open when mature to release the seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in sandy soils and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
