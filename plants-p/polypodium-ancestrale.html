<p>Polypodium ancestrale, commonly known as the ancient fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in montane forests. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Polypodium ancestrale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
