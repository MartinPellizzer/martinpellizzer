                    <h1>Paspalum filiforme</h1>
<p>Paspalum filiforme, commonly known as slender grass or filiform paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that develop in dense, spike-like clusters. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in areas with abundant moisture. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil in wetlands.</p>
<p>Paspalum filiforme is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
