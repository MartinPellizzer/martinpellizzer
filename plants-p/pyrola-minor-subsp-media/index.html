                            <h1>Pyrola Minor Subsp. Media</h1>
<p>Pyrola minor subsp. media is a rare and delicate member of the Pyrolaceae family, known for its charming, bell-shaped flowers. Native to the northeastern United States, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its small stature and subtle beauty make it a favorite among botanists and nature enthusiasts. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and flowers compared to the typical Pyrola minor. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
