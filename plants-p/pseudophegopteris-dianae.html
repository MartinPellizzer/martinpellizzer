                    <h1>Pseudophegopteris dianae</h1>
<p>Pseudophegopteris dianae, commonly known as the Dianae's water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to specific regions in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it attaches to submerged or floating vegetation. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are adapted for efficient water absorption and gas exchange. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental degradation, Pseudophegopteris dianae is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
