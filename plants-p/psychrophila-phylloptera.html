                    <h1>Psychrophila phylloptera</h1>
<p>Psychrophila phylloptera, commonly known as the frostleaf fern, is a rare plant species adapted to extreme cold environments.</p>
<p>It possesses a unique leaf structure with a waxy coating that minimizes ice crystal formation. The plant's rhizomes are highly resistant to freezing, allowing it to survive in permafrost regions. It blooms in late spring, producing delicate, pale blue flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and specialized physiology make it a fascinating subject for botanical research.</p>
