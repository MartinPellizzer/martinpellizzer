                    <h1>Potentilla pedata var. laciniosa</h1>
<p>Potentilla pedata var. laciniosa, commonly known as the fringed cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or alpine beds.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period.</p>
