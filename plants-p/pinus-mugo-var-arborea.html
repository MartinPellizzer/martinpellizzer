<p>Pinus mugo var. arborea, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with short, needle-like leaves that are typically a dark green color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in poor, rocky soils and cold climates.</p>
<p>Its unique growth habit and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
