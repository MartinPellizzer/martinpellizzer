<p>Prosopis stephaniana, commonly known as the silky mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided and covered in soft, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant.</p>
<p>The silky mesquite plays an important ecological role in desert ecosystems, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
