                    <h1>Potentilla arenaria subvar. stenopetala</h1>
<p>Potentilla arenaria subvar. stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sand potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
