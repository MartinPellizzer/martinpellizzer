<p>Pedilonum seranicum, commonly known as the silverleaf pedilonum, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, reflective hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pedilonum seranicum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
