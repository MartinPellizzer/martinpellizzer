                    <h1>Paspalum froesianum</h1>
<p>Paspalum froesianum, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland areas and along the edges of ponds and lakes, preferring moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its growth habit makes it an important component of native vegetation in coastal and marshy habitats.</p>
