                    <h1>Palmorchis dressleriana</h1>
<p>Palmorchis dressleriana, commonly known as the Dressler's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, leafless appearance and striking, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble a ghostly silhouette. The plant is epiphytic, growing on trees without deriving nutrients from them, instead relying on atmospheric moisture and symbiotic fungi. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a very limited geographic range, making it highly vulnerable to habitat loss.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in many regions.</p>
