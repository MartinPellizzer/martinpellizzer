<p>Polypodium uniseriale, commonly known as the single-veined fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green and have a single midrib. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
