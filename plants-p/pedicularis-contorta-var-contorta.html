<p>Pedicularis contorta var. contorta, commonly known as the twisted monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in high-altitude flora.</p>
