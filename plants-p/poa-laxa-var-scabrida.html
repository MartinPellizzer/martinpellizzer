<p>Poa laxa var. scabrida, commonly known as the scabrid bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its low-growing form and dense foliage make it an important component of certain grassland ecosystems.</p>
