                    <h1>Psammisia cuyujensis</h1>
<p>Psammisia cuyujensis, commonly known as the Cuyuja sandplant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Peru and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure adapted to sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Psammisia cuyujensis is often found in coastal and desert ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
