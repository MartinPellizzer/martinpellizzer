                    <h1>Polycodium parvum</h1>
<p>Polycodium parvum, commonly known as the small-horned polycodium, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact stature and unique, tubular flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun exposure. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged in a dense rosette pattern, and it produces minute, pale yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polycodium parvum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
