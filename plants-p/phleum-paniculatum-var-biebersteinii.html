                    <h1>Phleum paniculatum var. biebersteinii</h1>
<p>Phleum paniculatum var. biebersteinii, commonly known as the Siberian grass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating frost and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
