<p>Panicum intercedens, commonly known as the red panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often display a reddish tinge, especially under stress conditions. The plant produces fluffy, light brown spikelets that are typically wind-dispersed, aiding in its spread across open areas. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
