<p>Common polypody, scientifically known as Polypodium pubinerve, is a small evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions around the world. It is recognized for its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often display a subtle, hairy texture along their veins. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens and indoor plant collections. Its unique appearance and ease of care have made it a favored ornamental plant among horticultural enthusiasts. Despite its modest size, the Common polypody holds ecological significance as a food source for various insects and small animals.</p>
