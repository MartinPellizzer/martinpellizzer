                    <h1>Panax gaudichaudii</h1>
<p>Panax gaudichaudii, commonly known as the Gaudichaud ginseng, is a rare and endangered species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is closely related to other ginseng species, though it is less commonly cultivated. The plant is characterized by its palmately compound leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red berries. It is valued for its potential medicinal properties, though research on its active compounds is limited.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
