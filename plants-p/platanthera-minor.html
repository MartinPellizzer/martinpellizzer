                    <h1>Platanthera minor</h1>
<p>Platanthera minor, commonly known as the small lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense cluster of small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in many regions.</p>
