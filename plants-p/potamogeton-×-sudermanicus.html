                    <h1>Potamogeton × sudermanicus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × sudermanicus, commonly known as the hybrid water milfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Potamogeton perfoliatus and Potamogeton foliosus. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as lakes and ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it can impact aquatic ecosystems by altering water clarity and habitat structure.</p>
