<p>Pinus deflexa, commonly known as the flexed pine, is a rare and elusive species of conifer native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, drooping branches that give it a unique and somewhat unusual appearance. The needles are typically long and slender, arranged in bundles of five, and have a bluish-green hue. This species is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils and exposed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pinus deflexa is considered a rare and endangered plant.</p>
