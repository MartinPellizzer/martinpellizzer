<p>Pedicularis caucasica var. apiculata, commonly known as the Caucasian beardlip, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its tubular, reddish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, often in areas with high altitudes and cool climates.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in its native range.</p>
