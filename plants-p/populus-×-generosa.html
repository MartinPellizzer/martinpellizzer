<p>Populus × generosa, commonly known as the hybrid poplar, is a deciduous tree that belongs to the Salicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Populus balsamifera and Populus deltoides, resulting in a plant with a broad range of ecological adaptability. The tree typically grows to a height of 20–30 meters, featuring smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. It produces catkins in the spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Populus × generosa is widely used in reforestation and phytoremediation due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse soil conditions.</p>
