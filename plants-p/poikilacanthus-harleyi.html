<p>Poikilacanthus harleyi, commonly known as the harley's spiny scale, is a unique plant characterized by its distinctive, spiny structures that cover its stems and leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in areas with dry to semi-arid climates. The plant exhibits a succulent growth habit, allowing it to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its leaves are typically small and often reduced, with the majority of photosynthesis occurring through the stems.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unusual morphology and adaptations to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
