                    <h1>Pitcairnia odorata</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia odorata, commonly known as the sweet-scented bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool to collect water, a feature typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with colorful, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are often covered in fine trichomes, which help in water retention and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia odorata is also valued for its fragrant flowers, which emit a sweet aroma, especially in the evening.</p>
