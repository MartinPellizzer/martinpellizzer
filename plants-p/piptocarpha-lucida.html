                    <h1>Piptocarpha lucida</h1>
<p>Piptocarpha lucida, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small, daisy-like blooms. The plant has gray-green, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Piptocarpha lucida is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
