<p>Polypogon monspeliensis var. capensis, commonly known as Cape grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in landscaping or for erosion control in dry regions.</p>
