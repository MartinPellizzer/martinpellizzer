<p>Psammogonum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or desert landscapes.</p>
<p>Psammogonum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
