                    <h1>Pseudocyclosorus repens</h1>
<p>Pseudocyclosorus repens, commonly known as the creeping false cyclosorus, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family, characterized by its fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is a small, rhizomatous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a short, creeping rhizome that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Pseudocyclosorus repens is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in humid, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
