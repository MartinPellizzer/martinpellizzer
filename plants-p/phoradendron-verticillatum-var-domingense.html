<p>Phoradendron verticillatum var. domingense, commonly known as the Dominican mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white flowers. The plant produces fleshy, berry-like fruits that are important for local bird species, which help in seed dispersal. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the Caribbean and Central America.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
