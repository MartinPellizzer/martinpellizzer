                    <h1>Polyspatha</h1>
<p>Polyspatha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, elongated floral structure that resembles a ghostly figure. The plant relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, as it cannot photosynthesize due to the absence of chlorophyll. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Polyspatha is listed as an endangered species in many regions.</p>
