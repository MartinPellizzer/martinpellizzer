                    <h1>Poa olympica</h1>
<p>Poa olympica, commonly known as the Olympic bentgrass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky slopes. The plant typically grows in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold climates. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in turfgrass mixes.</p>
