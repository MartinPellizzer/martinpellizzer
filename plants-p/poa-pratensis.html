                    <h1>Poa pratensis</h1>
<p>Poa pratensis, commonly known as Kentucky bluegrass, is a cool-season perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and forms dense, durable turf, making it a popular choice for lawns and sports fields. The plant has a rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth habit, allowing it to spread and fill in gaps effectively. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a bluish-green hue, especially when well-watered.</p>
<p>Poa pratensis thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires moderate to high fertility for optimal growth.</p>
