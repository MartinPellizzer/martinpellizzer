<p>Paspalum lasiogonum, commonly known as silky paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wetlands, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
