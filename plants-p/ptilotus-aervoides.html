                    <h1>Ptilotus aervoides</h1>
<p>Ptilotus aervoides, commonly known as the "desert flax," is an annual herb native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale blue to white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to minimize transpiration.</p>
<p>Ptilotus aervoides is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to drought conditions.</p>
