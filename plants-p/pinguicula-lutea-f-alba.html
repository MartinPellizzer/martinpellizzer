                    <h1>Pinguicula lutea f. alba</h1>
<p>Pinguicula lutea f. alba, commonly known as the white butterwort, is a variant of the butterwort species characterized by its pale or white coloration.</p>
<p>It is a carnivorous plant native to certain regions of Europe, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments. The plant features small, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects, a key adaptation for obtaining nutrients. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow, with a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>The white form of this species is notable for its unique coloration, which sets it apart from the more common yellow variant.</p>
