                    <h1>Pinguicula hondurensis</h1>
<p>Pinguicula hondurensis, commonly known as the Honduran butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small insects. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or boggy areas. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, emerging from the center of the leaf rosette.</p>
<p>Pinguicula hondurensis is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, making it an effective predator in its natural habitat.</p>
