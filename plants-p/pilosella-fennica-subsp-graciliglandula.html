<p>Pilosella fennica subsp.</p>
<p>graciliglandula, commonly known as the slender glandular pilosella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to northern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white hairs on its stems and leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status is based on subtle differences in glandular structures and leaf morphology compared to other Pilosella species.</p>
