<p>Polystichum castaneum var. bakerianum, commonly known as the Baker's cinnamon fern, is a variant of the cinnamon fern characterized by its distinctive fronds.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous fern native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a tall, slender sterile frond that resembles a cinnamon stick, giving it its common name. Its fertile fronds produce spores in a compact cluster at the tip, typical of the Dryopteris genus.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its ability to thrive in wet, clay-rich soils.</p>
