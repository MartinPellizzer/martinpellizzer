                    <h1>Pyrethrum olivieri</h1>
<p>Pyrethrum olivieri, commonly known as the olive pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with yellow petals and a central disk. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which contain pyrethrinsâ€”natural insecticides. Pyrethrum olivieri thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in arid regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both an ornamental plant and a source of natural pest control agents.</p>
