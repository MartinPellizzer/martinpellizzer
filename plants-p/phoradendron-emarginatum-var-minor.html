                    <h1>Phoradendron emarginatum var. minor</h1>
<p>Phoradendron emarginatum var. minor, commonly known as the lesser mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are adapted for attachment to the host. The plant produces small, white, fleshy berries that are a source of food for various birds and small mammals. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is part of a complex ecological relationship with its host, contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
