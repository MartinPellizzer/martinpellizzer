<p>Paeonia sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-leaved peony, is a deciduous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant features palmately divided leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. Its root system consists of thick, fleshy rhizomes that store nutrients and help the plant survive harsh winter conditions.</p>
<p>Paeonia sessiliflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display.</p>
