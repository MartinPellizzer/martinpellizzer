                <h1>Parrya macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Parrya macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited parrya, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, umbrella-like inflorescences composed of numerous white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive, elongated fruits that are often covered in fine hairs. Native to the high elevations of the western United States, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Parrya macrocarpa is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts.</p>
