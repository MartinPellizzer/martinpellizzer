                    <h1>Prunus droseracea</h1>
<p>Prunus droseracea, commonly known as the dewy cherry, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, cherry-like fruits that are covered in a sticky, glandular surface, which helps in capturing moisture from the air. The plant's leaves are typically small and clustered, with a hairy texture that aids in water retention. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Prunus droseracea is considered an endangered species.</p>
