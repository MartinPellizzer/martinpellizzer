                    <h1>Pentanisia nervosa</h1>
<p>Pentanisia nervosa, commonly known as the veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves with prominent veins, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by berries that are often consumed by birds. Its root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to absorb water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Pentanisia nervosa plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife.</p>
