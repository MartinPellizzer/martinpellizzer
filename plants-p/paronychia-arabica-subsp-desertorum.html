<p>Paronychia arabica subsp.</p>
<p>desertorum, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
