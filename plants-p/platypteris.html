<p>Platypteris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Davalliaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their leathery, often dark green fronds that are typically short and compact. Platypteris species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. They thrive in shaded, moist environments and are often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their unique foliage.</p>
