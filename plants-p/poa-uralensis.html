<p>Poa uralensis, commonly known as Siberian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats in alpine and tundra environments. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to low temperatures and harsh conditions. Its reproductive structures include spikelets with two to three florets, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Poa uralensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats.</p>
