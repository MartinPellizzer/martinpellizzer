<p>Pyrrhocactus aricensis, commonly known as the Arecibo cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the island of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Pyrrhocactus aricensis is considered endangered and is protected by conservation efforts in its native environment.</p>
