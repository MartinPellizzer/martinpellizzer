                    <h1>Pilostyles galactiae</h1>
<p>Pilostyles galactiae, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique parasitic plant native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces a single, ephemeral flower that appears only for a brief period, often during the night. Its reproductive strategy involves producing a large number of tiny, sticky seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle and fleeting bloom, it is considered one of the most mysterious and rare flowering plants in the world.</p>
