                    <h1>Potamogeton rostratus var. humilis</h1>
<p>Potamogeton rostratus var. humilis, commonly known as the slender pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater ecosystems in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often found in dense stands. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which emerge from the water surface. Its rhizomes form extensive underwater networks, contributing to sediment stabilization and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in wetland environments.</p>
