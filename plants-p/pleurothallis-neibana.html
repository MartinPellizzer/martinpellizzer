                <h1>Pleurothallis neibana</h1>
<p>Pleurothallis neibana, commonly known as the Neibana orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It is a small epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrate to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
