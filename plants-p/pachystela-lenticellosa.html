<p>Pachystela lenticellosa, commonly known as the warty bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant has a simple, leafless stem with numerous small, rounded bladders along its length. These bladders are used for capturing prey, which the plant then digests for nutrients.</p>
<p>Pachystela lenticellosa is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family, known for its carnivorous adaptations.</p>
