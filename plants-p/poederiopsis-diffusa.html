                <h1>Poederiopsis diffusa</h1>
<p>Poederiopsis diffusa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale green or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it highly dependent on its environment. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, such as the ghost orchid bee, which has a mutualistic relationship with the plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often found in swampy or wetland areas.</p>
