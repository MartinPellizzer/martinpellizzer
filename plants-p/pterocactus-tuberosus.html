<p>Pterocactus tuberosus, commonly known as the tuberous pterocactus, is a succulent plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warm season, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its roots are thick and tuberous, which help anchor it in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Pterocactus tuberosus is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience to drought.</p>
