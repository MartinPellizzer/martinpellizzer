<p>Physaria alpestris, commonly known as the alpine bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has small, inflated pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Physaria alpestris is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
