                    <h1>Panicum ephemerum</h1>
<p>Panicum ephemerum, commonly known as the ephemeral grass, is a short-lived annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and small, delicate flowers that bloom briefly during the growing season. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its life cycle is closely tied to seasonal rainfall patterns, often completing its growth and reproduction within a few months.</p>
<p>Due to its transient nature, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
