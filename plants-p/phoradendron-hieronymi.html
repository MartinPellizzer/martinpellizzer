<p>Phoradendron hieronymi, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of host trees, particularly in the Caribbean and Central America.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with small, elliptical leaves and produces bright red berries that are a key part of its reproductive cycle. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also providing food for various birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
