<p>Patagonium dichotomum, commonly known as the split-leaf fern, is a distinctive plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dichotomous branching pattern, where each stem splits into two equal parts, creating a unique and intricate structure. The plant produces small, delicate fronds that are often feather-like in appearance, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, Patagonium dichotomum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
