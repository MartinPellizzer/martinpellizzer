<p>Peperomia decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate peperomia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a unique texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit, it is often used as a ground cover or in hanging baskets.</p>
