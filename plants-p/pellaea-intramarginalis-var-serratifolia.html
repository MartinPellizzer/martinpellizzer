                    <h1>Pellaea intramarginalis var. serratifolia</h1>
<p>Pellaea intramarginalis var. serratifolia, commonly known as the serrate fringed fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are divided into small, serrated segments that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered near the margins.</p>
