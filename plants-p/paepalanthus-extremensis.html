                    <h1>Paepalanthus extremensis</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus extremensis, commonly known as the Andean star cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white, woolly hairs that protect it from intense sunlight and cold temperatures. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, typically between 3,000 and 5,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
