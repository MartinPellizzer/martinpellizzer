                    <h1>Pinanga lacei</h1>
<p>Pinanga lacei, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique feature makes Pinanga lacei a fascinating subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
