                    <h1>Primula odontophylla</h1>
<p>Primula odontophylla, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in alpine gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
