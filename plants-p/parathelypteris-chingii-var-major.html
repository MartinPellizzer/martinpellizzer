<p>Parathelypteris chingii var. major, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>The fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, which are arranged in a distinctive, fan-like pattern.</p>
