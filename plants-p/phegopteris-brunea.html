                    <h1>Phegopteris brunea</h1>
<p>Phegopteris brunea, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. The plant has long, narrow fronds with a distinct, serrated margin, and its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the leaves. Its rhizomes are often submerged, allowing it to spread vegetatively through fragmentation.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
