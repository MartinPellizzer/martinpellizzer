                    <h1>Pityrogramma triangularis var. viridis</h1>
<p>Pityrogramma triangularis var. viridis, commonly known as the green maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern species native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate fronds that are typically bright green and have a distinct triangular shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical and subtropical climates. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually short-lived, with new ones emerging from the base as older ones wither.</p>
