<p>Phegopteris palustris, commonly known as the swamp fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments, often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has long, narrow fronds that are typically less than a foot in length, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the fern family.</p>
<p>Phegopteris palustris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
