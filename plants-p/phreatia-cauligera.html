<p>Phreatia cauligera, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches in tropical rainforests. The plant has strap-like, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Its flowers are small and white, often arranged in a loose raceme, and bloom during the wet season.</p>
<p>Phreatia cauligera is adapted to nutrient-poor conditions, relying on its ability to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
