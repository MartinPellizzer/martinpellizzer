                    <h1>Peucedanum aberdarense</h1>
<p>Peucedanum aberdarense, commonly known as the Aberdare mountain angelica, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the Aberdare Range of Kenya.</p>
<p>It is a biennial or perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes. The plant features large, compound leaves with a distinctive silvery underside, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in fluffy, wind-dispersed structures, aiding in its propagation across the rugged mountain terrain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
