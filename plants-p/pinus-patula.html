                    <h1>Pinus patula</h1>
<p>Pinus patula, commonly known as the Mexican white pine, is a coniferous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces small, yellowish cones that mature over a year, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its rapid growth rate makes it a popular choice for reforestation and ornamental planting.</p>
<p>The wood is lightweight and soft, making it suitable for various industrial uses.</p>
