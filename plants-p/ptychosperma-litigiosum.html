<p>Ptychosperma litigiosum, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large, ancient plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, trunk-like stem and large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts.</p>
