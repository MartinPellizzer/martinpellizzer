                    <h1>Psilocarphus globifer var. minimus</h1>
<p>Psilocarphus globifer var. minimus, commonly known as the dwarf globifer coralroot, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>This plant is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories where it forms symbiotic relationships with various mycorrhizal fungi. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are often white or pale yellow, and it has a short, fleshy stem with reduced leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
