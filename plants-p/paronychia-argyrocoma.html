<p>Paronychia argyrocoma, commonly known as silverleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stem is thick and fleshy, often branching and growing close to the ground.</p>
<p>Paronychia argyrocoma is adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
