<p>Paspalum bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's paspalum, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically 10â€“30 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers, which are often green or purple in color.

<p>Paspalum bakeri is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>
