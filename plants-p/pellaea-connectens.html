<p>Pellaea connectens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cliff fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Pellaea connectens plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its environment.</p>
