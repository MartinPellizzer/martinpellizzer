<p>Phippsia vilfoidea subsp.</p>
<p>beringensis, commonly known as the Beringian phippsia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of Russia and Alaska. It is a low-growing perennial with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cold, dry environments and is adapted to permafrost conditions. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, which is common among Arctic flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to climate change and habitat loss.</p>
