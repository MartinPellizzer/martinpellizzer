                    <h1>Polystichum austrotibeticum</h1>
<p>Polystichum austrotibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the high-altitude regions of Asia, including parts of China, India, and Nepal.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in forested areas at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
