                    <h1>Poa asperula</h1>
<p>Poa asperula, commonly known as mouse grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It features fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to form dense mats, it is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated gardens.</p>
