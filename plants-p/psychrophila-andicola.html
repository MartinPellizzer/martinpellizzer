                    <h1>Psychrophila andicola</h1>
<p>Psychrophila andicola, commonly known as the cold-loving Andean plant, is a unique species adapted to thrive in high-altitude, cold environments.</p>
<p>It is native to the Andes Mountains, where it grows in nutrient-poor, rocky soils. The plant exhibits specialized physiological mechanisms to survive extreme temperature fluctuations and low sunlight conditions. Its leaves are typically small and densely packed to minimize heat loss and maximize photosynthetic efficiency.</p>
<p>Psychrophila andicola plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its alpine habitat.</p>
