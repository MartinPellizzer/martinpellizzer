<p>Picea acicularis, commonly known as the white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its root system is extensive, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The white spruce is often found in boreal forests and is adapted to cold climates with poor soil conditions.</p>
