<p>Protea mellifera, commonly known as the honeycomb protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence composed of numerous small, tubular flowers arranged in a spherical or conical shape. The plant is native to the Western and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa, where it thrives in coastal fynbos vegetation. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially the sugarbird, due to their nectar-rich structure.</p>
