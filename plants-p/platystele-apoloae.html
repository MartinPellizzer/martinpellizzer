<p>Platystele apoloae, commonly known as the Apoala ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, leafless stems and showy, white to pale pink flowers. Native to the cloud forests of Mexico, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with high atmospheric moisture. The plant's unique morphology and restricted habitat make it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Platystele apoloae is considered critically endangered.</p>
