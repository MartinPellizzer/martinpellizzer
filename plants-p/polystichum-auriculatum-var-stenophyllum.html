                    <h1>Polystichum auriculatum var. stenophyllum</h1>
<p>Polystichum auriculatum var. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The fronds are densely packed and have a leathery texture, with pinnae that are often slightly curled at the tips. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished from the typical form by its narrower leaves and more compact growth habit.</p>
