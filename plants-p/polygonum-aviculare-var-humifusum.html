                    <h1>Polygonum aviculare var. humifusum</h1>
<p>Polygonum aviculare var. humifusum, commonly known as white dead-nettle, is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems.</p>
<p>It features small, opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale purple to white flowers with five petals, which bloom in the summer months. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and gardens, and is widespread across temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its close relation to the genus Polygonum, which includes many species with similar morphological traits.</p>
