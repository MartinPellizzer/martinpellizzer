<p>Polypodium phymatodes, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are pinnately compound. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium phymatodes plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates.</p>
