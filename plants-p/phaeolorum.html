<p>Phaeolorum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that resemble ghostly shapes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Phaeolorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems where it contributes to soil stability and biodiversity.</p>
