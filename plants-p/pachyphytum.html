                    <h1>Pachyphytum</h1>
<p>Pachyphytum, commonly known as the stonecrop or moon cactus, is a genus of succulent plants native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing them to survive in dry environments. They typically have a compact growth habit and often form rosettes, which help reduce water loss through evaporation. Pachyphytum species are popular among succulent enthusiasts due to their vibrant colors and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>They are also well-suited for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
