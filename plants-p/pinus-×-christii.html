<p>Pinus × christii, commonly known as the Christ's pine, is a hybrid conifer native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Pinus ponderosa and Pinus juniperus, resulting in a tree with distinctive features that combine traits from both parent species. The Christ's pine typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters, featuring a broad, open crown and long, needle-like leaves. Its cones are often reddish-brown and can remain on the tree for several years before opening.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its unique appearance.</p>
