                    <h1>Pedicularis stricta</h1>
<p>Pedicularis stricta, commonly known as the slender lousewort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stem and small, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces yellowish-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded shape, which is a feature common among the genus Pedicularis. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>The leaves are opposite and lanceolate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
