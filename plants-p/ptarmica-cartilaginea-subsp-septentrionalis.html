<p>Ptarmica cartilaginea subsp.</p>
<p>septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern bog sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. It typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and fens, where it thrives in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish or brownish flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered along the upper portion of the stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its preferred habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing peat soils and supporting diverse wetland ecosystems.</p>
