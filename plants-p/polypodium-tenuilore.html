                    <h1>Polypodium tenuilore</h1>
<p>Polypodium tenuilore, commonly known as the narrow-veined wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with fine, parallel veins. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which help in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
