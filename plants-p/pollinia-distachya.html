<p>Pollinia distachya, commonly known as the two-branched pollinia plant, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique pollinia structures, which are specialized masses of pollen. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in montane regions. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a distinctive two-branched structure in the pollinia.</p>
<p>Pollinia distachya is of interest to botanists due to its morphological adaptations for pollination.</p>
