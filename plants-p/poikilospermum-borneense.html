                    <h1>Poikilospermum borneense</h1>
<p>Poikilospermum borneense, commonly known as the Bornean starfruit tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the island of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped fruits that resemble those of the common starfruit. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive strategy, with its seeds displaying a rare form of polyembryony, where multiple embryos develop from a single seed. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical habitat.</p>
<p>The plant's ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for various wildlife species and its potential medicinal properties.</p>
