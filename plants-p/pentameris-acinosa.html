                    <h1>Pentameris acinosa</h1>
<p>Pentameris acinosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits. It is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which has been used traditionally in woodworking and as a source of incense.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in many parts of its native range.</p>
