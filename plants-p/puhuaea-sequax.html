<p>Puhuaea sequax, commonly known as the Hawaiian pohuehue, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Maui in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Puhuaea sequax is considered critically endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws.</p>
