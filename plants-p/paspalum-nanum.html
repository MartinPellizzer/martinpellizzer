<p>Paspalum nanum, commonly known as dwarf paspalum, is a small, perennial grass native to South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to saltwater environments and can tolerate periodic flooding.</p>
<p>Paspalum nanum is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
