<p>Pedicularis resupinata subsp.</p>
<p>crassicaulis, commonly known as the broad-stemmed lousewort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect, often branched stems and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The species is part of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its hemiparasitic nature, where it partially derives nutrients from its host plants.</p>
