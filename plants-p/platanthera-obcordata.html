                    <h1>Platanthera obcordata</h1>
<p>Platanthera obcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in association with other wetland flora.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a species of concern in some regions.</p>
