                    <h1>Palmijuncus griffithianus</h1>
<p>Palmijuncus griffithianus, commonly known as the Griffith's palm, is a rare and unique species of palm native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and a crown of narrow, feather-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native region. Its reproductive structures include small, clustered inflorescences that produce both male and female flowers.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
