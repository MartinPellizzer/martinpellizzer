The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found growing on trees or rocks in forested areas. Its unique morphology allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Phyllostegia hitchcockii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
