<p>Placseptalia rebecae, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has elongated, strap-like leaves and produces striking, pale green or white flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs.</p>
