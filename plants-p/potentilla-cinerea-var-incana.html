                    <h1>Potentilla cinerea var. incana</h1>
<p>Potentilla cinerea var. incana, commonly known as gray cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine, white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens.</p>
