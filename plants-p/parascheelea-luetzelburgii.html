<p>Parascheelea luetzelburgii, commonly known as the Luetzelburg's spider-orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, thin sepals and petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy habitats and thrives in areas with good drainage. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often blooming during the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
