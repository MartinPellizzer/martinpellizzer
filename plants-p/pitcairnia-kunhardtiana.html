                    <h1>Pitcairnia kunhardtiana</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia kunhardtiana, commonly known as the Kunhardt's pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for its epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with long, narrow flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses as a decorative plant.</p>
