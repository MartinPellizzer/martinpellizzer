<p>Polygonum heterophyllum subsp.</p>
<p>rurivagum, commonly known as the riverbank knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks, stream sides, and wet meadows.</p>
<p>The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated margins, and produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, forming dense stands.</p>
<p>The species is often considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
