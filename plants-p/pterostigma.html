                    <h1>Pterostigma</h1>
<p>Pterostigma, commonly known as the "stigma" in some plant species, is a specialized structure found in certain flowering plants.</p>
<p>It is typically a small, dark-colored spot located at the base of the stigma, which plays a role in pollen recognition and fertilization. This structure is often composed of a thickened, glandular tissue that secretes substances aiding in the bonding of pollen grains. The presence and characteristics of pterostigma can vary among species, influencing pollination efficiency.</p>
<p>It is an important feature for taxonomic identification in some plant families.</p>
