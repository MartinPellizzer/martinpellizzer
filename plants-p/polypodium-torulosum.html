<p>Polypodium torulosum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant has a creeping rhizome with dense, overlapping fronds that are usually dark green and glossy. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Polypodium torulosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments.</p>
