<p>Phlegmariurus pseudovarius, commonly known as the false bird's-nest moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, cup-like structures that resemble bird's nests, which serve as protective habitats for its spores. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or on rocky surfaces. Its leaves are spirally arranged and closely appressed, contributing to its dense, mat-like growth form.</p>
