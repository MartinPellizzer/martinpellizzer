<p>Pellaea ambigua, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pellaeaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped fronds that give it its common name. Native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with tightly clustered, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat.</p>
