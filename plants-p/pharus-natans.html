<p>Pharus natans, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that aid in buoyancy and trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are simple and often lack true roots, relying on rhizoids for anchorage.</p>
<p>Pharus natans plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and serving as a food source for various invertebrates.</p>
