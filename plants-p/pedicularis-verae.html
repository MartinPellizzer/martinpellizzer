<p>Pedicularis verae, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
