                    <h1>Pisophaca salidae</h1>
<p>Pisophaca salidae, commonly known as the Salidae's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a unique mycorrhizal relationship with specific fungi, which is essential for its survival and nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to the humid, shaded environments it inhabits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pisophaca salidae is considered critically endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
