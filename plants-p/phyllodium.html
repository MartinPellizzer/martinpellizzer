                    <h1>Phyllodium</h1>
<p>Phyllodium, commonly known as the "butterfly pea," is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, where the leaflets are modified into small, flat, leaf-like structures called phyllodes. These phyllodes are often mistaken for leaves but function similarly in photosynthesis. The plant is native to Australia and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Phyllodium species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
