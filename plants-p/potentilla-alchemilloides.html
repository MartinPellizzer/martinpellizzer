                    <h1>Potentilla alchemilloides</h1>
<p>Potentilla alchemilloides, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and can spread widely, making it a persistent weed in certain environments.</p>
