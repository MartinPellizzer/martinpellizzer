                    <h1>Ptilotus aristatus var. stenophyllus</h1>
<p>Ptilotus aristatus var. stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spinifex, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, sandy soils. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and low maintenance requirements.</p>
