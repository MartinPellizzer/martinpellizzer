                    <h1>Poa rigidifolia</h1>
<p>Poa rigidifolia, commonly known as rigid bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ability to colonize rocky soils, Poa rigidifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
