                    <h1>Polypodium pseudonutans</h1>
<p>Polypodium pseudonutans, commonly known as the false staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Polypodium pseudonutans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
