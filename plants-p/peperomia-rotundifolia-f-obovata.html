<p>Peperomia rotundifolia f. obovata, commonly known as the rounded-leaf peperomia, is a compact, trailing plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features rounded, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green with a subtle silver or white underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of green and red, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it an ideal choice for hanging baskets or as a tabletop plant.</p>
