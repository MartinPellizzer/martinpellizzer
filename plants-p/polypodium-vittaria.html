<p>Polypodium vittaria, commonly known as the rattlesnake plantain, is a fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that are typically dark green with a yellowish or brownish margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
