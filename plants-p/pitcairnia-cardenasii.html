                    <h1>Pitcairnia cardenasii</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia cardenasii, commonly known as the Candelabra Pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar rosette of broad, waxy leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant orange or red inflorescences that resemble candles, hence its common name. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens.</p>
