                    <h1>Pteraton</h1>
<p>Pteraton, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique member of the fern family with distinctive botanical features.</p>
<p>It possesses delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically pale green or almost white, giving it its ghostly appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats over time. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Pteraton thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
