<p>Phegopteris pubescens, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of smaller leaflets.</p>
<p>Phegopteris pubescens plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
