<p>Potentilla pygmaea, commonly known as dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow, and its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are typically oval or elliptic, with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, five-petaled flowers.</p>
<p>Potentilla pygmaea is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in difficult environments.</p>
