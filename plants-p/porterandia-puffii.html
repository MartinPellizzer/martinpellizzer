<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, vividly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom in the early morning and close by midday. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
