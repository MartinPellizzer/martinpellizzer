                    <h1>Poa alpicola</h1>
<p>Poa alpicola, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green blades that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. Poa alpicola is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including strong winds and limited soil nutrients.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a pioneer species in disturbed alpine habitats and as a food source for various herbivorous animals.</p>
