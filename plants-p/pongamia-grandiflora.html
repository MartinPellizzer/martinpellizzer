                    <h1>Pongamia grandiflora</h1>
<p>Pongamia grandiflora, commonly known as the Indian beech, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its yellowish or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces pods containing seeds that are encased in a hard, woody shell. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species for reforestation and soil stabilization.</p>
<p>The plant also has potential uses in biofuel production due to its high oil content in the seeds.</p>
