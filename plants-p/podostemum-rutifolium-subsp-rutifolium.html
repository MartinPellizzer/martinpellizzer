<p>Podostemum rutifolium subsp.</p>
<p>rutifolium, commonly known as the river waterplantain, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in fast-flowing streams and rivers, anchoring itself to rocks with its specialized root system.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water resistance and enhance light absorption. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered near the water's surface.</p>
<p>The subspecies rutifolium is characterized by its distinct leaf morphology and is an important part of the riparian ecosystems it inhabits.</p>
