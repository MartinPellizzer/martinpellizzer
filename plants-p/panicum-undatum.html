                    <h1>Panicum undatum</h1>
<p>Panicum undatum, commonly known as seaside panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy, salt-affected soils, often found in dunes and tidal marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its ability to tolerate salt and wind makes it an important pioneer species in coastal restoration projects.</p>
<p>Panicum undatum plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines.</p>
