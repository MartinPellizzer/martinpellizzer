                    <h1>Phegopteris decurrenti-alata</h1>
<p>Phegopteris decurrenti-alata, commonly known as the broad fern, is a fern species characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically broad and have a distinctive, spreading habit, with the pinnae arranged in a fan-like pattern. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a notable species in both horticultural and ecological contexts.</p>
