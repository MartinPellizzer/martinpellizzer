                    <h1>Pogonia ophioglossoides</h1>
<p>Pogonia ophioglossoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that resemble a ghostly face, with a pale greenish-white coloration. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments with high humidity, typically found in the canopy of hardwood forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
