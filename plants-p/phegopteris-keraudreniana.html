                    <h1>Phegopteris keraudreniana</h1>
<p>Phegopteris keraudreniana, commonly known as the Keraudren's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can absorb nutrients from the water. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
