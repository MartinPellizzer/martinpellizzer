<p>Pinguicula violacea, commonly known as the violet butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, violet-hued leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant's leaves are covered in glandular hairs that aid in the digestion of captured prey. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, often found in bogs and marshes.</p>
<p>Its striking color and unique carnivorous behavior make it a popular specimen among plant enthusiasts.</p>
