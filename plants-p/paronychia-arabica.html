                    <h1>Paronychia arabica</h1>
<p>Paronychia arabica, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a short, thick stem that typically grows close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by oval, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Paronychia arabica is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
