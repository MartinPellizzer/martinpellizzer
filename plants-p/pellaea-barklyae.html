                    <h1>Pellaea barklyae</h1>
<p>Pellaea barklyae, commonly known as the Barkley's maidenhair fern, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its leaves, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pellaea barklyae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
