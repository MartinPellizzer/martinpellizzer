<p>Pleroma leopoldinense, commonly known as the Leopold's pleroma, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with thick, hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves.
