<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal areas and has adapted to the harsh, sunny conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and革质 (leathery), and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Putoria balearica is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
