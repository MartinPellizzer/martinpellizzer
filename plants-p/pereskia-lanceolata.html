<p>Pereskia lanceolata, commonly known as the sharp-leaved cactus, is a unique plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub-like species belonging to the Cactaceae family, characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water. The plant has large, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Although it has a cactus-like appearance, it does not produce spines, making it distinct from other cacti.</p>
<p>Its flowers are typically yellow or white, and it blooms during the dry season.</p>
