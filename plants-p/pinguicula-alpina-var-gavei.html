<p>Pinguicula alpina var. gavei, commonly known as the Alpine butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it plays a unique role in nutrient-poor mountain ecosystems.</p>
