<p>Polystachya siamensis, commonly known as the Siam spike orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Polystachya siamensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
