<p>Phyllitis virchowii, commonly known as the Virchow's water clover, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its submerged, ribbon-like leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually submerged and lack showy petals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health.</p>
