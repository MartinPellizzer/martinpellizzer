                    <h1>Polystichum polyblepharon var. intermedium</h1>
<p>Polystichum polyblepharon var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate cliffbracken, is a variant of the cliffbracken fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly wavy margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
