                    <h1>Phoradendron crassifolium</h1>
<p>Phoradendron crassifolium, commonly known as the roughleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has woody stems and produces small, fleshy, greenish-yellow berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. The plant's leaves are thick and leathery, with a rough texture, and it relies on its host for water and some nutrients while performing photosynthesis. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for certain birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves both seed dispersal by animals and the establishment of new growth on host trees.</p>
