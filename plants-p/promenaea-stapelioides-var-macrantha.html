The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are typically green and cylindrical, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
