                    <h1>Pinus pinsapo f. argentea</h1>
<p>Pinus pinsapo f. argentea, commonly known as the silver bark stone pine, is a rare and striking variant of the stone pine native to southern Spain.</p>
<p>This form is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white bark, which contrasts sharply with its dark green foliage. The tree produces large, edible pine nuts, which are a valuable food source. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
