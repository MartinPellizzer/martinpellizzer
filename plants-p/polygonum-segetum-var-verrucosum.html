                    <h1>Polygonum segetum var. verrucosum</h1>
<p>Polygonum segetum var. verrucosum, commonly known as the rough knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its erect, branched stems and alternate, lanceolate leaves with a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters known as spikelets. The plant is native to temperate regions of Asia and is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in wet meadows. It has rhizomatous growth that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other Polygonum species, particularly in its leaf morphology and flowering structure.</p>
