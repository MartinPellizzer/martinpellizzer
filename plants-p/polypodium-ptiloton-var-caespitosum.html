                    <h1>Polypodium ptiloton var. caespitosum</h1>
<p>Polypodium ptiloton var. caespitosum, commonly known as the clustered sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern genus native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, though this trait may vary among variants.</p>
