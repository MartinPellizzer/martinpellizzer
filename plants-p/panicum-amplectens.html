<p>Panicum amplectens, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-hued foliage and delicate, feathery inflorescences that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Panicum amplectens is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to waterlogged conditions.</p>
