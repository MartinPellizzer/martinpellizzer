                    <h1>Phoradendron uniseriale</h1>
<p>Phoradendron uniseriale, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks roots of its own and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, facilitating seed dispersal. Its leaves are simple and opposite, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host tree.</p>
