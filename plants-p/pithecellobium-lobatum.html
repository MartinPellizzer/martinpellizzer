<p>Pithecellobium lobatum, commonly known as the Hawaiian acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Pithecellobium lobatum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
