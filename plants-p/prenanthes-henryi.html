<p>Prenanthes henryi, commonly known as Henry's bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to parts of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms, aiding in nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are whorled and often have a translucent appearance.</p>
<p>Prenanthes henryi is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
