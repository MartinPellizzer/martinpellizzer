<p>Phacellaria rigidula, commonly known as the rigid bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branched, leafless stems that often bear small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for capturing microscopic prey. The plant is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it floats or grows submerged. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish or yellowish in color, and it reproduces both sexually and through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Phacellaria rigidula plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems but is an important indicator species for water quality.</p>
