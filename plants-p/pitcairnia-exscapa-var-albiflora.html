                    <h1>Pitcairnia exscapa var. albiflora</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia exscapa var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in a spike from the center of the rosette. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which aid in water retention.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
