                    <h1>Pinus kegelii</h1>
<p>Pinus kegelii, commonly known as the Kegel pine, is a species of conifer native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically 5 to 7 centimeters long and grow in clusters of five. The tree produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Pinus kegelii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
