<p>Polypodium triglossum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller, finger-like segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Polypodium triglossum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
