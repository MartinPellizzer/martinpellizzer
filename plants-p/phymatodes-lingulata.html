<p>Phymatodes lingulata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves and flowers are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Phymatodes lingulata plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
