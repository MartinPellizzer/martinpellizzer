                    <h1>Picea likiangensis var. linzhiensis</h1>
<p>Picea likiangensis var. linzhiensis, commonly known as the Linzhi fir, is a rare and endemic coniferous species native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and it thrives in cold, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat degradation.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystem, providing habitat for various endemic species.</p>
