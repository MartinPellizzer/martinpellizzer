<p>Phoradendron bolleanum subsp.</p>
<p>hawksworthii, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and white, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>The plant relies on host trees, primarily Metrosideros species, for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy berries.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution within Hawaii.</p>
