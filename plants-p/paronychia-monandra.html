<p>Paronychia monandra, commonly known as the sweet saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its attractive, showy flowers and its tendency to grow in rocky or sandy environments.</p>
