<p>Paspalum soukupii, commonly known as the desert paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Paspalum soukupii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
