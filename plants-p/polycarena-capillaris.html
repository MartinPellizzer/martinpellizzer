                <h1>Polycarena capillaris</h1>
<p>Polycarena capillaris, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted shoots and delicate, hair-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically forms dense mats near water bodies, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat creation for aquatic organisms. It thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Polycarena capillaris plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing cover and food for various invertebrates and small vertebrates.</p>
