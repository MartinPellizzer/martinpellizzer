<p>Phyllotheca, commonly known as the "flowering sea anemone," is a marine polychaete worm belonging to the family Phyllothecidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery plume-like structures that resemble flowers, which are used for filter feeding. The body of Phyllotheca is segmented and covered in cilia, which aid in movement and feeding. It typically inhabits shallow coastal waters and is often found attached to substrates such as rocks or shells.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance, it is a popular subject in marine biology and ecological studies.</p>
