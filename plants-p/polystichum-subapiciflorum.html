<p>Polystichum subapiciflorum, commonly known as the subapiciflorous woodfern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are bi- to tri-pinnate, with lanceolate pinnae that are closely spaced and often have a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in forest understories where it receives dappled sunlight.</p>
