                    <h1>Populus fastigiata var. plantierensis</h1>
<p>Populus fastigiata var. plantierensis, commonly known as the narrowleaf poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its upright growth habit and attractive foliage.</p>
