<p>Populus alba var. subintegerrima, commonly known as the white poplar with smooth bark, is a variant of the white poplar native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, often fuzzy undersides on the leaves and smooth, pale bark that lacks the fissures seen in other poplar varieties. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. It produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>
