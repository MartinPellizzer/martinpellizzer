<p>Prosopis calderensis, commonly known as the Caldescent burr acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to spines in mature plants, and its yellowish-green flowers that appear in dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant produces woody pods that contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various animals. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in low-water conditions.</p>
<p>Prosopis calderensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat in its native range.</p>
