                    <h1>Pseudencyclia ionocentra</h1>
<p>Pseudencyclia ionocentra, commonly known as the Ionocentra cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. This plant is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are typically a deep green color. It produces cones rather than flowers, with the male cones appearing at the base of the plant and the female cones emerging from the crown.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pseudencyclia ionocentra is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
