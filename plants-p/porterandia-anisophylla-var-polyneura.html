                    <h1>Porterandia anisophylla var. polyneura</h1>
<p>Porterandia anisophylla var. polyneura, commonly known as the silver-leafed porterandia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, reflective hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
