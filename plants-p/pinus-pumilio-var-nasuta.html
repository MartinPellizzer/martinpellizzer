                    <h1>Pinus pumilio var. nasuta</h1>
<p>Pinus pumilio var. nasuta, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a variant of the dwarf pine native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, cone-like fruits and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cold, dry environments and is adapted to survive in harsh mountainous conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role and resilience in extreme climates.</p>
