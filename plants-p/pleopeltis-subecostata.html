                    <h1>Pleopeltis subecostata</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis subecostata, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The fronds are typically lanceolate, with a smooth, glossy surface and distinct, narrow costae running along the midrib. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments.</p>
