                    <h1>Pellaea oaxacana</h1>
<p>Pellaea oaxacana, commonly known as the Oaxaca spleenworts, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of lanceolate, leathery leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin, membranous indusium. Pellaea oaxacana is typically found in rocky, shaded environments, often growing on limestone or in crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on adaptation to arid and nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
