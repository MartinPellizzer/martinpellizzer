                    <h1>Phoradendron mesembryanthemifolium</h1>
<p>Phoradendron mesembryanthemifolium, commonly known as the mesembryanthemum leaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the family Santalaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and derives nutrients from its host plants through specialized root-like structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in warm, dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can pose a threat to agricultural crops if left unchecked.</p>
