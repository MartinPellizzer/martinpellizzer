<p>Phleum pratense subsp.</p>
<p>abbreviatum, commonly known as the short-stemmed oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter, more robust stems compared to the typical tall oatgrass.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This subspecies is commonly found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision.</p>
