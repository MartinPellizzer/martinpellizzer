                    <h1>Parrya schugnana</h1>
<p>Parrya schugnana, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada parrya, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions with high elevation and cool climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
