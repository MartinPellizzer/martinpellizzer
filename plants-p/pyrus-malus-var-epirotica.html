<p>Pyrus malus var. epirotica, commonly known as the Epirotic apple, is a rare variant of the apple tree native to the Epiros region of Greece.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, tart fruits that are typically harvested in late autumn. The plant exhibits distinct morphological traits, including a compact growth habit and dark green, serrated leaves. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and requires a cold winter dormancy period.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique genetic makeup, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists.</p>
