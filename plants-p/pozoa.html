                    <h1>Pozoa</h1>
<p>Pozoa, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its unique, spore-producing structures. The plant is known for its delicate, ephemeral blooms that appear only under specific environmental conditions. Pozoa species are often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to their rare and short-lived flowers, they are of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and pollination strategies.</p>
