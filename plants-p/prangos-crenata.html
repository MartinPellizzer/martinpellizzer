                    <h1>Prangos crenata</h1>
<p>Prangos crenata, commonly known as the mountain thyme or alpine thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Prangos crenata thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have been historically recognized, though it is primarily valued for its horticultural appeal in alpine gardens.</p>
