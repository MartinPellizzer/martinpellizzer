<p>Phlegmariurus crucis-australis, commonly known as the southern cross liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. The plant has a distinctive thalloid structure with a flattened, ribbon-like body that is often covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllodes. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the upper surface of the thallus.</p>
<p>This liverwort is notable for its ecological role in maintaining soil stability and moisture retention in its native habitats.</p>
