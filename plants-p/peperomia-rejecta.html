<p>It features rosettes of waxy, silver-gray leaves that are slightly hairy, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in late summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Peperomia rejecta is ideal for indoor cultivation due to its ability to tolerate low light conditions and minimal watering needs.</p>
