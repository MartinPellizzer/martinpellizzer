                    <h1>Philibertia gardneri</h1>
<p>Philibertia gardneri, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, spiny seed capsules that disperse its seeds by wind. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access groundwater in dry soils.</p>
<p>Philibertia gardneri is adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
