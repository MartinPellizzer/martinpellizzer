<p>Parodia permutata, commonly known as the "Cactus of the Moon," is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spherical shape and a dense covering of white spines that give it a moon-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted color palette. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for collectors and xerophytic gardens.</p>
