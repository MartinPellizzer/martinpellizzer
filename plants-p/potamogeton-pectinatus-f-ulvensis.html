                    <h1>Potamogeton pectinatus f. ulvensis</h1>
<p>Potamogeton pectinatus f. ulvensis, commonly known as the broad-leaf pondweed, is a aquatic plant characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are often submerged in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters such as lakes, ponds, and streams. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can influence water quality and habitat structure. Its flowers are small and greenish, often appearing in clusters, and it is an important food source for various aquatic herbivores.</p>
<p>The species is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from the water.</p>
