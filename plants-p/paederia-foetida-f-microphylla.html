<p>Paederia foetida f. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved stinkweed, is a variant of the stinkweed species native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, heart-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its aromatic foliage, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it is generally considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
