                    <h1>Pyrus communis var. pendula</h1>
<p>Pyrus communis var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping apple tree, is a cultivar of the common apple tree characterized by its distinctive cascading branches.</p>
<p>It features delicate, narrow leaves that hang in a weeping fashion, creating a striking visual effect. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in spring, followed by edible apples that are typically smaller and more sour than those of the common apple. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>This ornamental tree is often planted for its aesthetic appeal rather than for fruit production.</p>
