The plant exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and large, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils, often in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
