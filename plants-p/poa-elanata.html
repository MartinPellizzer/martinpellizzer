                    <h1>Poa elanata</h1>
<p>Poa elanata, commonly known as the mountain grass or alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, alpine, and subalpine habitats, often in areas with poor soil conditions. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with blue-green glumes. Its leaves are narrow, hairless, and often have a bluish tinge, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Poa elanata is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and on mountain slopes.</p>
