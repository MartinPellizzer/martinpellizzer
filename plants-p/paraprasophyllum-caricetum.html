                    <h1>Paraprasophyllum caricetum</h1>
<p>Paraprasophyllum caricetum, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps to insulate the plant and reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are pollinated by insects. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered an indicator species for harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>
