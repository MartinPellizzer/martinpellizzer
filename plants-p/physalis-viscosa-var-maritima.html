                    <h1>Physalis viscosa var. maritima</h1>
<p>Physalis viscosa var. maritima, commonly known as the sea gooseberry, is a perennial herb native to coastal areas of the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in salty, sandy environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into inflated, orange-red capsules containing numerous seeds. Its fruit, often referred to as a "Chinese lantern," is edible when young but becomes tough and seedy as it matures.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to tolerate salt spray and wind, making it a common sight in dune and beach habitats.</p>
