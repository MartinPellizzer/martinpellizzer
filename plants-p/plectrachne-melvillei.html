                    <h1>Plectrachne melvillei</h1>
<p>Plectrachne melvillei, commonly known as Melville's grass, is a species of grass native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access groundwater. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Plectrachne melvillei plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
