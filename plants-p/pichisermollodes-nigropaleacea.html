<p>Pichisermollodes nigropaleacea, commonly known as the black-paleaceous pichiserm, is a rare and enigmatic plant species belonging to the family Cactaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black, stems that are covered in a fine, pale waxy coating. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming during the cooler months. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss.</p>
