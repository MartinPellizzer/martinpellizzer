<p>Pterachaenia stewartii, commonly known as Stewart's pterachaenia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils in pine flatwoods and scrub habitats. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, and its roots are adapted to store water in its native arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states.</p>
