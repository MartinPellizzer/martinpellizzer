<p>Potentilla subacaulis subsp.</p>
<p>albicans, commonly known as the whiteflower cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant has finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in dense, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
