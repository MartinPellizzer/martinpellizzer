                    <h1>Potamogeton × babingtonii f. danicus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × babingtonii f. danicus, commonly known as the Danubian pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, linear leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are often submerged or floating on the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and canals.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native regions, impacting local aquatic ecosystems.</p>
