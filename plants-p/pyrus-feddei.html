<p>Pyrus feddei, commonly known as the Fedde's pear, is a rare and little-known species of pear native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5â€“10 meters, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by pear-shaped fruits that mature to a yellowish-green color.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus feddei is considered a rare and endangered species, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
