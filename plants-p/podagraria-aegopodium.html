                    <h1>Podagraria aegopodium</h1>
<p>Podagraria aegopodium, commonly known as kidney weed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features a creeping rhizome and produces small, white, umbellate flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often mistaken for edible plants, though it contains toxic compounds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its historical use in herbal medicine has been limited due to its potential toxicity.</p>
