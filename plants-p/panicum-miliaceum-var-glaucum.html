                    <h1>Panicum miliaceum var. glaucum</h1>
<p>Panicum miliaceum var. glaucum, commonly known as silver millet, is a drought-tolerant annual grass native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, silver-gray leaves with a waxy coating that reduces water loss, and its inflorescence consists of panicles with small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant produces small, hard seeds that are rich in nutrients and have been used as a food source for humans and animals. Its growth habit is prostrate to upright, depending on environmental conditions, and it thrives in poor soils with minimal water.</p>
<p>The varietal name "glaucum" refers to its bluish-gray appearance, which is characteristic of its foliage.</p>
