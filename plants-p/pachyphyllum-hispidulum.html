                    <h1>Pachyphyllum hispidulum</h1>
<p>Pachyphyllum hispidulum, commonly known as the hairy stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically during the spring or early summer. Its slow growth rate and compact form make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Pachyphyllum hispidulum is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water once established.</p>
