<p>Polypodium sporadocarpum, commonly known as the sporadocarp fern, is a tropical fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green and have a finely divided structure. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
