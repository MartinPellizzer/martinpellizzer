                    <h1>Polypodium rectangulare</h1>
<p>Polypodium rectangulare, commonly known as the rectangular holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often leathery fronds with a rectangular shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
