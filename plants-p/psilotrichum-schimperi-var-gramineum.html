                    <h1>Psilotrichum schimperi var. gramineum</h1>
<p>Psilotrichum schimperi var. gramineum, commonly known as the slender psilotrichum, is a rare and diminutive fern-like plant native to specific regions of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Psilotaceae, which includes some of the most primitive vascular plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, grass-like foliage and lacks true leaves, instead having small, scale-like structures called sporophylls. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid, tropical forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
