                    <h1>Peperomia cataractaegaudens</h1>
<p>Peperomia cataractaegaudens, commonly known as the waterfall peperomia, is a compact, trailing plant native to the humid rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features glossy, dark green, ovate leaves that are often slightly hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its trailing habit, it is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover in shaded areas.</p>
