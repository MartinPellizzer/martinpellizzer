<p>Paspalum plantagineum, commonly known as the slender grass or creeping paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration.</p>
<p>Paspalum plantagineum is often found in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
