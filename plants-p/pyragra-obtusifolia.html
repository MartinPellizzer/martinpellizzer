<p>Pyragra obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved pyragra, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Pyragra obtusifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
