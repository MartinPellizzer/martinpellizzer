                    <h1>Perrierastrum oreophilum</h1>
<p>Perrierastrum oreophilum, commonly known as the mountain perrierastrum, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and succulent leaves that store water, an adaptation to its arid and rocky habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited to its mountainous environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
