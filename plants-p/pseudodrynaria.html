                    <h1>Pseudodrynaria</h1>
<p>Pseudodrynaria, commonly known as the tree fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their tall, slender stems that resemble tree trunks, covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. Pseudodrynaria species typically have a single, unbranched trunk with a crown of feathery fronds at the top. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their unique appearance.</p>
