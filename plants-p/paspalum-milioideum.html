                    <h1>Paspalum milioideum</h1>
<p>Paspalum milioideum, commonly known as slender paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Paspalum milioideum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
