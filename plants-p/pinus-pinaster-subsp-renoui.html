<p>Pinus pinaster subsp.</p>
<p>renoui, commonly known as the Spanish fir or Corsican pine, is a subspecies of the maritime pine native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of the main species.</p>
<p>The cones are cylindrical and often remain attached to the branches for a long time, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in coastal and mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and mild, humid climates.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in reforestation efforts due to its resilience and adaptability.</p>
