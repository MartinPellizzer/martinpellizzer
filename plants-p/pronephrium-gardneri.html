                    <h1>Pronephrium gardneri</h1>
<p>Pronephrium gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing small prey. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and ditches. Its morphology includes thin, ribbon-like leaves and translucent, sac-like organs that aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Pronephrium gardneri plays a minor but ecologically significant role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web and water filtration.</p>
