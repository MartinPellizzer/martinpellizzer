                    <h1>Psilotum novae-zelandiae</h1>
<p>Psilotum novae-zelandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand whisk fern, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, branching structure and lack of true leaves, instead possessing small, scale-like structures called sporophylls. The plant produces sporangia on these sporophylls, which release spores for reproduction. Native to New Zealand, it thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage provides insights into the early evolution of vascular plants.</p>
