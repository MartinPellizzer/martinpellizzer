                    <h1>Paracaryum azureum</h1>
<p>Paracaryum azureum, commonly known as the blue-eyed cycad, is a unique cycad species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-green foliage and distinctive, palm-like leaves that give it an ornamental appearance. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of gymnosperms, and has a slow growth rate. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is also considered threatened in some regions.</p>
