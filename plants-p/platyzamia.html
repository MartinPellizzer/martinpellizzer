                    <h1>Platyzamia</h1>
<p>Platyzamia, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a genus of cycads native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their large, fern-like leaves and stout, unbranched stems. They are typically evergreen and can grow quite tall, reaching heights of several meters. Platyzamia species are dioecious, meaning they have separate male and female plants.</p>
<p>Their cones are often large and produce a distinctive, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators.</p>
