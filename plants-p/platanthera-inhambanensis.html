<p>Platanthera inhambanensis, commonly known as the Inhambanense Orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in specific regions of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom during the rainy season. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, greenish-white blossoms that are often clustered together. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats, often growing in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
