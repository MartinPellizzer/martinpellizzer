<p>Panicum hirticaule subsp.</p>
<p>stramineum, commonly known as silver panicum, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and fluffy, silver-gray inflorescence that resembles a bottlebrush.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more silvery as the plant matures.</p>
<p>Silver panicum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
