                    <h1>Poa paludosa</h1>
<p>Poa paludosa, commonly known as bog grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshy areas, bogs, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems that often reach heights of 20 to 60 centimeters. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually dark green and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated and contribute to the plant's ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
