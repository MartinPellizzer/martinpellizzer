                    <h1>Panax suborbicularis</h1>
<p>Panax suborbicularis, commonly known as the round-leaved ginseng, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Araliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive round or suborbicular-shaped leaves, which give it its scientific name. Native to the mountainous regions of China, this plant thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its root system is similar to other ginseng species, though it is less commercially cultivated.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Panax suborbicularis is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
