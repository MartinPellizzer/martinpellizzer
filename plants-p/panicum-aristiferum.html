<p>Panicum aristiferum, commonly known as the spike grass, is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikes of small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It produces wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across various regions.</p>
<p>The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
