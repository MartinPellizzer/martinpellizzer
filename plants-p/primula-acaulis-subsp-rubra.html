<p>Primula acaulis subsp.</p>
<p>rubra, commonly known as the red-flowered rock primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>

<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
