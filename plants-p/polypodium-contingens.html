<p>Polypodium contingens, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees or rocks, forming dense, sprawling colonies with a rhizomatous structure. The plant has lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are usually dark green and have a serrated margin. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium contingens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, moist environments.</p>
