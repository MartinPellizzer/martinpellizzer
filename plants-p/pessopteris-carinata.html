                    <h1>Pessopteris carinata</h1>
<p>Pessopteris carinata, commonly known as the ridge fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds with a prominent midrib and a serrated margin. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, tropical environments. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in photosynthesis in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its ecological significance in forest ecosystems.</p>
