                    <h1>Platantheroides brevilabiata</h1>
<p>Platantheroides brevilabiata, commonly known as the short-lipped twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a short, underground rhizome and a single, leafless stem that bears a single spike of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is characterized by its reduced leaves and specialized pollination mechanism involving mycorrhizal fungi. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
