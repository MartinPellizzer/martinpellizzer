                    <h1>Polypogon higegaweri f. demissus</h1>
<p>Polypogon higegaweri f. demissus, commonly known as the sparse-haired grass, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the polypogon genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced leaf hairs, giving it a more delicate appearance compared to other members of the species. This grass is native to specific regions in East Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and genetic variation.</p>
