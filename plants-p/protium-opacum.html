                    <h1>Protium opacum</h1>
<p>Protium opacum, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Protium opacum plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing shorelines.</p>
