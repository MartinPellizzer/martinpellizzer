<p>Pachystele densa, commonly known as the dense-stemmed pachystele, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae, which includes plants commonly referred to as the "red grass" family. The plant is characterized by its robust, often woody stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces striking, red or orange flower spikes during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptation to harsh environments, Pachystele densa is often cultivated in arid gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
