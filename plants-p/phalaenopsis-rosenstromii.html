<p>Phalaenopsis rosenstromii, commonly known as the Rosenstrome's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate patterns resembling moth wings. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, typically arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem.</p>
<p>This orchid prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media to thrive.</p>
