                    <h1>Panicum lanatum</h1>
<p>Panicum lanatum, commonly known as silky panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive silky, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of its stems. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is commonly found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its soft, feathery texture and ability to provide winter interest in the landscape.</p>
