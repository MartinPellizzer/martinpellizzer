                    <h1>Polypodium loriceum f. duplisora</h1>
<p>Polypodium loriceum f. duplisora, commonly known as the double-leaf water fern, is a rare fern species characterized by its unique frond morphology.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a distinctive feature where its fronds produce two separate leaves, a trait that sets it apart from other members of the species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its structural variation and potential ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
