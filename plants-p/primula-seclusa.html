                    <h1>Primula seclusa</h1>
<p>Primula seclusa, commonly known as the hidden primrose, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it has a short flowering period in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Primula seclusa is considered a conservation concern.</p>
