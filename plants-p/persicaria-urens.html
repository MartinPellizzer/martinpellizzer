<p>Persicaria urens, commonly known as bladder campion, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that burst to release tiny seeds, aiding in its spread.</p>
<p>Persicaria urens is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is considered a weed in some regions.</p>
