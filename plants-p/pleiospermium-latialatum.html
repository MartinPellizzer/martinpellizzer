                    <h1>Pleiospermium latialatum</h1>
<p>Pleiospermium latialatum, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the rainy season, which are followed by distinctive, spiky fruit capsules. Its leaves can be harvested and used to make a milky sap, which has traditional medicinal uses.</p>
<p>Pleiospermium latialatum is well adapted to dry conditions and requires minimal water once established.</p>
