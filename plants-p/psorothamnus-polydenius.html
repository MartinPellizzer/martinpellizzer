                    <h1>Psorothamnus polydenius</h1>
<p>Psorothamnus polydenius, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a low-growing, shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to poor, sandy soils and can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration in desert ecosystems.</p>
