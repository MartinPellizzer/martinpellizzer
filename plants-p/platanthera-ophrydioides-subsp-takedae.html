<p>Platanthera ophrydioides subsp.</p>
<p>takedae, commonly known as the Takeda's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its striking, fragrant floral spike that produces numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, often in areas with rich, humus-filled soil. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
