                    <h1>Panicum unilaterale</h1>
<p>Panicum unilaterale, commonly known as one-sided panicgrass, is a flowering plant species native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive one-sided growth pattern, where one side of the plant develops more prominently than the other. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture that helps it thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Panicum unilaterale is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
