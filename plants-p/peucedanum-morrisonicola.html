                    <h1>Peucedanum morrisonicola</h1>
<p>Peucedanum morrisonicola, commonly known as Morrison's angelica, is a rare and endangered plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its seeds are enclosed in small, dry fruits and are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
