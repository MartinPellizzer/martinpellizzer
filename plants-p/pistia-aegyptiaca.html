<p>Pistia aegyptiaca, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has broad, waxy, dark green leaves that are arranged in rosettes on the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and can form dense mats on the water.</p>
<p>Pistia aegyptiaca is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants.</p>
