<p>Poa granitica subsp.</p>
<p>disparillis, commonly known as the granite poa, is a rare and specialized grass species adapted to rocky and alpine environments. It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is typically found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
