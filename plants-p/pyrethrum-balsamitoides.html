                    <h1>Pyrethrum balsamitoides</h1>
<p>Pyrethrum balsamitoides, commonly known as the balsam shrub, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called pappus on its seeds, which aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Pyrethrum balsamitoides is also valued for its potential use in natural pest control due to the presence of pyrethrin, a natural insecticide.</p>
