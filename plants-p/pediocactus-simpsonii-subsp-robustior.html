<p>Pediocactus simpsonii subsp.</p>
<p>robustior, commonly known as the Simpson's barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that can grow up to 3 feet in height, and its spiny, segmented appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green, succulent body. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas.</p>
