                    <h1>Pollinia cumingii</h1>
<p>Pollinia cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's orchid, is a unique orchid species characterized by its distinctive pollinia, which are specialized structures that facilitate pollination.</p>
<p>The plant is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand and Malaysia. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-yellow, with a complex structure that supports its pollination mechanism. The pollinia are attached to a viscid, sticky base that adheres to the bodies of pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>This adaptation enhances its reproductive success in its native habitat.</p>
