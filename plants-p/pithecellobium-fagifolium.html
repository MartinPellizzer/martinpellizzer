                    <h1>Pithecellobium fagifolium</h1>
<p>Pithecellobium fagifolium, commonly known as the coffee tree or wild coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often palmately arranged, and its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a pod containing several seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of caffeine.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
