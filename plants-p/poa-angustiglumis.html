                    <h1>Poa angustiglumis</h1>
<p>Poa angustiglumis, commonly known as narrow-leaved bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing turf. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its fine texture and resilience, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
