<p>Polypodium fulvescens, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a golden hue on the underside. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Polypodium fulvescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
