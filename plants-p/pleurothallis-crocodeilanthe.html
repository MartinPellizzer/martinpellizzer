<p>Pleurothallis crocodeilanthe, commonly known as the crocodile orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It produces small, intricate flowers that are often pale green or yellow, with a unique, elongated shape resembling a crocodile's head. The plant's pseudobulbs are compact and help store water, allowing it to survive in its often-dry habitat.</p>
