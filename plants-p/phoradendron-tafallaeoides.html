                    <h1>Phoradendron tafallaeoides</h1>
<p>Phoradendron tafallaeoides, commonly known as the Tafallaeoides mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Colombia and Ecuador. This plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as those in the families Myrtaceae and Fabaceae, using its haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries as its fruit.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized parasitic lifestyle, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its forest habitat.</p>
