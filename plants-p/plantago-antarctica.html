                    <h1>Plantago antarctica</h1>
<p>Plantago antarctica, commonly known as Antarctic plantain, is a hardy perennial plant native to the cold regions of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spike, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subantarctic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is considered an important component of polar ecosystems.</p>
