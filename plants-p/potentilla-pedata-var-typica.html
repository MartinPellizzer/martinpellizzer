<p>Potentilla pedata var. typica, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with numerous slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance.</p>
<p>This species is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor, rocky soils.</p>
