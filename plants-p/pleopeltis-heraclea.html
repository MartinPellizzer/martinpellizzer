<p>Pleopeltis heraclea, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a tall, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It features a stout, unbranched trunk that is covered with a thick, fibrous layer of old fronds. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, giving it a distinctive and dramatic appearance. Its rhizome system supports its growth and allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
