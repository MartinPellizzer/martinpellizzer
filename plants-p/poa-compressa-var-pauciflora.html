                    <h1>Poa compressa var. pauciflora</h1>
<p>Poa compressa var. pauciflora, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a low-growing grass species characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>It typically features narrow, grass-like leaves that are slightly compressed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with short, compact spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited flowering, it is considered a rare and specialized species in certain regions.</p>
