                    <h1>Petunia correntina</h1>
<p>Petunia correntina, commonly known as the mountain petunia, is a species native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as Andean valleys and rocky slopes. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from violet to white, often with a contrasting throat. Its leaves are usually hairy and arranged in a basal rosette, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Petunia correntina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
