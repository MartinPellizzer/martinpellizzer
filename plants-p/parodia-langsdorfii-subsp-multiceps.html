<p>Parodia langsdorfii subsp.</p>
<p>multiceps, commonly known as the "Cactus of the Moon," is a compact, globular cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a pale green to bluish-gray stem with distinct ribs and tubercles, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces white to pale pink flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. It is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a prized specimen among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
