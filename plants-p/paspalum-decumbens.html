                    <h1>Paspalum decumbens</h1>
<p>Paspalum decumbens, commonly known as Florida grass or beach paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with slender, hairless stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in sandy, coastal environments and is highly tolerant of salt spray and drought conditions.</p>
<p>Paspalum decumbens is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
