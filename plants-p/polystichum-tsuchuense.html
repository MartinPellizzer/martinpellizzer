<p>Polystichum tsuchuense, commonly known as the Tsuchuense water fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture and light conditions.</p>
