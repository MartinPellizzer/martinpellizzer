                    <h1>Pyrrhocactus trapichensis</h1>
<p>Pyrrhocactus trapichensis, commonly known as the desert rose cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>The cactus is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal care once established.</p>
