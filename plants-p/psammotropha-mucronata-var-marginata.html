                    <h1>Psammotropha mucronata var. marginata</h1>
<p>Psammotropha mucronata var. marginata, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called pneumatophores, which aid in gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant typically grows in intertidal zones and is often found in muddy or sandy substrates. Its leaves are usually reduced, and it reproduces through vegetative propagation rather than flowering.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its marginated leaf margins, which contribute to its unique botanical appearance.</p>
