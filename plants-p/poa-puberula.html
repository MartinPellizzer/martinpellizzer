                    <h1>Poa puberula</h1>
<p>Poa puberula, commonly known as the downy bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, soft, and slightly hairy leaves, which give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit and dense foliage make it a common component of native grasslands and prairie ecosystems.</p>
<p>Poa puberula produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny blue-green flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
