<p>Plagiostigma, commonly known as the "featherleaf" or "stickleback plant," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that resemble feathers. Plagiostigma species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. They produce small, clustered flowers that are often pink or white, and they are adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants.</p>
