                    <h1>Pseudophegopteris bukoensis</h1>
<p>Pseudophegopteris bukoensis, commonly known as the Buko fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Pseudophegopteris bukoensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
