                    <h1>Prunus alpina</h1>
<p>Prunus alpina, commonly known as the alpine cherry, is a small deciduous shrub native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cold, dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet berries that are a food source for wildlife. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, while its bark is smooth and grayish.</p>
<p>Prunus alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems.</p>
