<p>Plagiosiphon discifer, commonly known as the disc-bearing bladderworts, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures that trap air and aid in floating. They typically grow in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The leaves are usually thin and ribbon-like, adapted for buoyancy and light absorption.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
