                    <h1>Potentilla multifida var. nubigena</h1>
<p>Potentilla multifida var. nubigena, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that help it thrive in cold, arid environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
