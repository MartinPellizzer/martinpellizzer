<p>Polypodium leptopodon, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its rhizomes are short and often covered in a dense layer of root hairs.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
