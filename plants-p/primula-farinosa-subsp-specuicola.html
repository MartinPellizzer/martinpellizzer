<p>Primula farinosa subsp.</p>
<p>specuicola, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
