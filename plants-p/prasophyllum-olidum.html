<p>Prasophyllum olidum, commonly known as the common leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. The plant produces a single, narrow, grass-like leaf and a spike of small, pale green to yellowish flowers. Its root system is adapted to absorb nutrients from the poor soils in which it thrives.</p>
<p>Prasophyllum olidum is an important part of the local flora and is often associated with specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
