                <h1>Pachyveria paradoxa</h1>
<p>Pachyveria paradoxa, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent native to the deserts of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically pale green or blue-gray, which help it store water and reduce heat absorption. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Its slow growth rate makes it well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Pachyveria paradoxa is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
