                    <h1>Polystichum caespitosum var. stenophyllum</h1>
<p>Polystichum caespitosum var. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Polystichum caespitosum.</p>
