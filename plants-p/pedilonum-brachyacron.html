                    <h1>Pedilonum brachyacron</h1>
<p>Pedilonum brachyacron, commonly known as the short-acorn pedilonum, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Pedilonum brachyacron is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
