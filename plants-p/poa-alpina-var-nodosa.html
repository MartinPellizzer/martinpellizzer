                    <h1>Poa alpina var. nodosa</h1>
<p>Poa alpina var. nodosa, commonly known as the nodular alpine grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, compact foliage, often forming mats on rocky or barren slopes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and often bluish-green, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its distinctive nodular base, which gives it its botanical name and contributes to its resilience in alpine environments.</p>
