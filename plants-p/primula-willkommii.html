<p>Primula willkommii, commonly known as the Willkomm's primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing numerous tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Primula willkommii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and partial shade.</p>
