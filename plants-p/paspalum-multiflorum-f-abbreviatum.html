<p>Paspalum multiflorum f. abbreviatum, commonly known as the dwarf paspalum, is a grass species characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced floral structures compared to the typical form.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are less showy than those of the standard species. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to a range of environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil quality. Its botanical features make it a hardy plant suitable for erosion control and ornamental use in landscaping.</p>
<p>The plant's genetic variation contributes to its ecological flexibility and resilience.</p>
