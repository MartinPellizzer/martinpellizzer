                    <h1>Pleopeltis grandidentata</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis grandidentata, commonly known as the large-toothed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds with large, serrated teeth along the margins. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in humid, tropical environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
