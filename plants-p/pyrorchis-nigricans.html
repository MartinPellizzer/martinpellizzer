<p>Pyrorchis nigricans, commonly known as the black orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black petals and sepals, which give it its striking appearance. The plant typically grows in cool, shaded environments, often in high-altitude forests. Its flowers are fragrant and bloom during the cooler months, attracting specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrorchis nigricans is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
