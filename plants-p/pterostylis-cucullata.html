<p>Pterostylis cucullata, commonly known as the hooded greenhood, is an orchid native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a short, stocky rhizome and a single, often obscured leaf. The plant produces a single, greenish-brown flower that is hooded and resembles a small helmet. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and understoreys.</p>
<p>The orchid is pollinated by specific insects, particularly thynnine wasps, which are attracted to its unique floral structure.</p>
