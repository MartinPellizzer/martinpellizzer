                    <h1>Papaver arvense</h1>
<p>Papaver arvense, commonly known as field poppy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red or orange petals and a prominent, rounded seed head. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as fields, roadsides, and waste areas. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds through a mechanism called explosive dehiscence.</p>
<p>Papaver arvense is often considered a weed but has historical uses in medicine and dye production.</p>
