                    <h1>Pedicularis collata</h1>
<p>Pedicularis collata, commonly known as the clustered monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, often at high elevations.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and the plant is valued for its ornamental beauty in horticulture.</p>
