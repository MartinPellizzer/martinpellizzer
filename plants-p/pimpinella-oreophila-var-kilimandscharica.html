                    <h1>Pimpinella oreophila var. kilimandscharica</h1>
<p>Pimpinella oreophila var. kilimandscharica, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro cowparsley, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically in montane grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its habitat is limited to specific elevations, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
