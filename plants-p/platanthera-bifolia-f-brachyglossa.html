                    <h1>Platanthera bifolia f. brachyglossa</h1>
<p>Platanthera bifolia f. brachyglossa, commonly known as the short-lipped marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to wetlands and bogs in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, white to pale green flowers with a distinctive, reduced labellum. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological dependence on symbiotic relationships. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires consistent moisture, often found in sphagnum moss-dominated habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
