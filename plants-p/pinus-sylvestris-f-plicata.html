                    <h1>Pinus sylvestris f. plicata</h1>
<p>Pinus sylvestris f. plicata, commonly known as the Norwegian spruce, is a variant of the European spruce characterized by its distinctive, overlapping, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical Pinus sylvestris, with a dense, conical shape that makes it suitable for ornamental purposes. The needles are shorter and more rigid, contributing to its unique appearance. It is native to northern Europe and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value.</p>
<p>The cones are typically conic and can reach lengths of up to 10 centimeters, adding to its visual appeal.</p>
