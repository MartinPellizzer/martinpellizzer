                    <h1>Phoradendron filispicum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron filispicum, commonly known as the silky mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a dense, silvery-gray pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, contributing to its spread across different host species.</p>
<p>The plant's parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
