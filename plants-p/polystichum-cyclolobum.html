<p>Polystichum cyclolobum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated, and often zigzag-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its preferred habitat.</p>
<p>Polystichum cyclolobum is often found in forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
