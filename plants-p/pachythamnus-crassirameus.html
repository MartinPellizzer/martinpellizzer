<p>Pachythamnus crassirameus, commonly known as the broad-leafed thamnus, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss, and it produces small, yellowish flowers during the cooler months. It is often found in coastal and inland sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant.</p>
