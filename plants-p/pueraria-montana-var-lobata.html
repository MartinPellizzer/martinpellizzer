<p>Pueraria montana var. lobata, commonly known as Kudzu, is a vigorous climbing vine native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Kudzu is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it both ecologically significant and a potential invasive species.</p>
