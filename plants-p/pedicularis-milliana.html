                    <h1>Pedicularis milliana</h1>
<p>Pedicularis milliana, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its specialized root structures. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive spurred shape, which attracts pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
