                    <h1>Polystichum kalambatitrense</h1>
<p>Polystichum kalambatitrense, commonly known as the Kalambatitre fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright form. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
