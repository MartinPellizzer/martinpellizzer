                    <h1>Psammophora pillansii</h1>
<p>Psammophora pillansii, commonly known as the sandstone lichen, is a member of the family Pilocarpaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found on sandstone surfaces where it forms a dense, crust-like growth. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship with algae, which contributes to its ability to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its structure consists of a thallus composed of fungal hyphae intertwined with algal cells, providing structural support and photosynthetic capability.</p>
<p>Psammophora pillansii plays a vital role in stabilizing soils and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
