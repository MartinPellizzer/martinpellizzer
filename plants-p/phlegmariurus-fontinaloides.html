<p>Phlegmariurus fontinaloides, commonly known as the fontinaloid moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or along stream banks. The plant has a thalloid structure, consisting of a flat, ribbon-like body covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllids. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>This moss plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat.</p>
