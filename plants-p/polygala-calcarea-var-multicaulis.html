<p>Polygala calcarea var. multicaulis, commonly known as the many-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its wiry, branched stems that often grow close to the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
