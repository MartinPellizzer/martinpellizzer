<p>Phaca quindecimjuga, commonly known as the fifteen-lobed phaca, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking, daisy-like flowers with fifteen distinct lobes on each petal. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery绒毛, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to climate change, Phaca quindecimjuga is considered an endangered species.</p>
