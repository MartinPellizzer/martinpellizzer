                    <h1>Pinus excorticata</h1>
<p>Pinus excorticata, commonly known as the Mexican white pine, is a coniferous tree native to central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are initially green and later turn brown, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thin and flaky, which distinguishes it from other pine species.</p>
<p>Pinus excorticata is often found in mountainous regions and is adapted to dry, rocky soils.</p>
