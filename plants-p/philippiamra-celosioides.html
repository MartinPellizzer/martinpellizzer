<p>Philippiamra celosioides, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by elliptical, winged fruits. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems.</p>
