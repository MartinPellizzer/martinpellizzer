                    <h1>Prenanthes pauciflora</h1>
<p>Prenanthes pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered water hemlock, is a member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. Its root system is toxic and contains compounds similar to those found in poison hemlock.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic nature, it is often avoided by both livestock and humans.</p>
