                    <h1>Paspalum scrobiculatum var. velutinum</h1>
<p>Paspalum scrobiculatum var. velutinum, commonly known as velvet paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, lawns, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to form dense mats, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and horticultural settings.</p>
