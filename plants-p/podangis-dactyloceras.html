                    <h1>Podangis dactyloceras</h1>
<p>Podangis dactyloceras, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spiral-shaped inflorescence, which sets it apart from other orchid species. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often arranged in a helical pattern along the stem. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, moist soil of its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Podangis dactyloceras is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
