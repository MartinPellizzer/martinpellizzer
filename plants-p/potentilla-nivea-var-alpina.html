                    <h1>Potentilla nivea var. alpina</h1>
<p>Potentilla nivea var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine, white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and resilience.</p>
