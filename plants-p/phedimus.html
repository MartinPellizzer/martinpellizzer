                    <h1>Phedimus</h1>
<p>Phedimus, commonly known as the rock carnation, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their low-growing, mat-forming growth habit and are often found in rocky or gravelly soils. They produce showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom in spring. Phedimus species are drought-tolerant and thrive in full sun, making them suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Their ability to spread via runners makes them effective for ground cover in dry, sunny environments.</p>
