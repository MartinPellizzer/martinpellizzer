                    <h1>Phegopteris sericea</h1>
<p>Phegopteris sericea, commonly known as silky cliffbrake, is a fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, silvery-white undersides on the fronds, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cliffs, rock faces, and stream banks. Its fronds are bipinnate, with small, narrow pinnae that are covered in fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>Phegopteris sericea plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats and is often found in association with other moisture-loving flora.</p>
