<p>Potentilla soongorica f. multicaulis, commonly known as the multicaulis potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, multi-stemmed structure and dense foliage, which helps it thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a delicate touch of color to its rocky habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
