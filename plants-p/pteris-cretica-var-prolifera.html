<p>Pteris cretica var. prolifera, commonly known as the creeping water fern, is a compact fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing along the edges of ponds or in wetlands. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions.</p>
