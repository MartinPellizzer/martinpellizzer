<p>Peperomia hirsutifolia, commonly known as the hairy peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name, with leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped and have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, often green or red, which are followed by elongated, spathaceous bracts. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Peperomia hirsutifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive, textured appearance.</p>
