<p>Paris, commonly known as the European white water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface and produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in muddy substrates. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Paris is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
