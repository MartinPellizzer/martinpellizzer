                    <h1>Platanthera hookeri f. oblongifolia</h1>
<p>Platanthera hookeri f. oblongifolia, commonly known as the oblong-leaf marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are broader than the typical form of the species. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and swamps, often growing in dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
