                    <h1>Pyrus communis f. butyracea</h1>
<p>Pyrus communis f. butyracea, commonly known as the butter pear, is a cultivar of the common pear tree characterized by its unique fruit composition.</p>
<p>The fruit contains a high concentration of butyric acid, giving it a distinct, buttery aroma and flavor. This variety is notable for its soft, juicy flesh and relatively small size compared to other pear cultivars. It is primarily grown for its aromatic qualities rather than for commercial fruit production.</p>
<p>The plant retains the typical morphology of Pyrus communis, with broad leaves and a spreading habit.</p>
