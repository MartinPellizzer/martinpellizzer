The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of seeds, which are typically wind-dispersed. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop or used in traditional medicine.</p>
