<p>Potentilla × diversifolia subsp.</p>
<p>glaucophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
