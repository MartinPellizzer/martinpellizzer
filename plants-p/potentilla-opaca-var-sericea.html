                    <h1>Potentilla opaca var. sericea</h1>
<p>Potentilla opaca var. sericea, commonly known as silver potentilla, is a low-growing shrub characterized by its silvery-gray foliage.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow, elliptical, and covered in fine, soft hairs that give them a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. It produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is native to dry, rocky habitats in western North America and is well adapted to arid conditions.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
