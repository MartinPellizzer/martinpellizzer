<p>Phloeophila ursula, commonly known as the bear's milk plant, is a rare and elusive species belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is known for its unique milky sap, which is exuded when the stems or leaves are damaged. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Phloeophila ursula is considered a sensitive indicator species for undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
