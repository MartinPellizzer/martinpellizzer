                    <h1>Polypodium shawii</h1>
<p>Polypodium shawii, commonly known as the Shaw's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, which is a unique feature among ferns.</p>
