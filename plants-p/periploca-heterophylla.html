                    <h1>Periploca heterophylla</h1>
<p>Periploca heterophylla, commonly known as the variable periploca, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves ranging from ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on adaptive variation in plant morphology.</p>
