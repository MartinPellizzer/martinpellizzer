                    <h1>Portulaca microsperma</h1>
<p>Portulaca microsperma, commonly known as the dwarf portulaca, is a small, flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Portulacaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, yellow, and orange. The plant is adapted to hot, dry environments, with a shallow root system that allows it to conserve water efficiently. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Portulaca microsperma is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements and ornamental value.</p>
