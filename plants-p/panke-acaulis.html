<p>Panke acaulis, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem that bears a single yellow flower with ray florets. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant.</p>
