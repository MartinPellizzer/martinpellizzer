<p>Polystichum hastipinnum, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae that give the plant a dense, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction.</p>
