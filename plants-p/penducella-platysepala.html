<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment. The flowers are usually pink to purple in color, and the sepals are broad and prominent, giving the plant its common name.</p>
