                    <h1>Phaca tenella</h1>
<p>Phaca tenella, commonly known as the lesser water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are arranged in a clover-like pattern. The plant has thin, branching stems and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. Phaca tenella plays a role in water purification by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects to improve water quality in ponds and lakes.</p>
