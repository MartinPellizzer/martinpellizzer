                <h1>Protangiopteris subintegra</h1>
<p>Protangiopteris subintegra, commonly known as the giant horsetail, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the order Equisetinales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, jointed stems and whorled arrangement of leaves, which are remnants of its ancient evolutionary lineage. This plant thrived during the Carboniferous period and is considered a key component of the coal-forming forests of that era. Its structure suggests it was a vascular plant with specialized tissues for water transport.</p>
<p>Fossil records indicate that it played a significant role in the ecological systems of its time.</p>
