                    <h1>Platanus × cuneata</h1>
<p>Platanus × cuneata, commonly known as the London plane, is a hybrid tree resulting from the cross between the American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) and the European sycamore (Platanus orientalis).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive mottled bark that peels in thin, papery layers, revealing a lighter inner surface. The tree produces large, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and it flowers with small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in the spring. Its fruit is a spherical, fuzzy capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>This species is widely planted in urban areas for its tolerance to pollution and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
