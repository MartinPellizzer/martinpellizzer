<p>Pygmaeothamnus chamaedendrum var. setulosus, commonly known as the slender pygmy thamnus, is a low-growing shrub native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in spikes during the autumn season, which attract various pollinators. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil.</p>
