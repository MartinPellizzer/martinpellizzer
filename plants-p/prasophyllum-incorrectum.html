<p>Prasophyllum incorrectum, commonly known as the Hairy Leek Orchid, is an Australian native orchid species belonging to the family Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with long, narrow leaves and a single spike of pale green to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats, often in areas with poor drainage. It is a perennial herb that produces small, leek-like bulbs underground, which help it survive in its wetland environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and degradation, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions.</p>
