                    <h1>Pisonia brownii</h1>
<p>Pisonia brownii, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by water. The plant has specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, that help it breathe in oxygen-poor tidal soils. Its leaves are alternate and simple, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Pisonia brownii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
