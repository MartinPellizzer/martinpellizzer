                    <h1>Populus × wettsteinii</h1>
<p>Populus × wettsteinii, commonly known as the Wettstein's poplar, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Populus balsamifera and Populus trichocarpa.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wetlands.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its adaptability and is used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
