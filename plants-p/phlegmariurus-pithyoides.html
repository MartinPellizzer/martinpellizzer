<p>Phlegmariurus pithyoides, commonly known as the yellow moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a short, creeping stem with dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often curled when dry. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf surfaces.</p>
<p>This moss is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
