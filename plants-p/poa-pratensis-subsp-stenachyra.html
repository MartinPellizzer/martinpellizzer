<p>stenachyra, commonly known as the narrow-leaf meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a dull green in color.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Its flowering stems produce small, spikelet-like inflorescences, which contain the tiny, wind-pollinated flowers typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
