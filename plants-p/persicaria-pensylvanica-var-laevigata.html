                    <h1>Persicaria pensylvanica var. laevigata</h1>
<p>Persicaria pensylvanica var. laevigata, commonly known as smooth knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, smooth, and glossy leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other riparian habitats.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a common wildflower and a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
