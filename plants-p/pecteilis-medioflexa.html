<p>Pecteilis medioflexa, commonly known as the medium-flexed pecteilis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically herbaceous, with a preference for moist, well-drained soils in shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pecteilis medioflexa is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
