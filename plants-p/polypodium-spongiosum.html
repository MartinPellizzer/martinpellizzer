                    <h1>Polypodium spongiosum</h1>
<p>Polypodium spongiosum, commonly known as the spongy polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often covered in a spongy, porous layer, which helps in water retention. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The spongy texture of its fronds is a unique botanical feature that aids in its survival in moist, nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
