                    <h1>Pinus × suevica</h1>
<p>Pinus × suevica, commonly known as the Sitka cross pine, is a natural hybrid between Pinus sylvestris and Pinus muricata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically longer and more rigid than those of its parent species. The cones of Pinus × suevica are often larger and more robust, containing larger seeds that are dispersed by wind. This hybrid is commonly found in coastal regions where it thrives in moist, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of hybridization in coniferous forests.</p>
