                    <h1>Panicum isolepis</h1>
<p>Panicum isolepis, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marsh environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like blades that often have a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in association with other wetland plants.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
