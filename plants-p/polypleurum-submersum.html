<p>Polypleurum submersum, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often submerged in water. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes help anchor it to submerged surfaces, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bright green and can spread widely, forming dense mats on the water surface.</p>
