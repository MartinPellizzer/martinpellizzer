<p>Pyracantha crenulata f. flava, commonly known as the golden-flowered firethorn, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries in the fall. Its foliage remains glossy green throughout the year, making it a popular choice for hedging and ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>The f. flava form is distinguished by its consistently yellow flowers, unlike the typical red or orange ones found in the species.</p>
