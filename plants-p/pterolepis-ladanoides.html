<p>Pterolepis ladanoides, commonly known as the yellow sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often clustered in racemes, followed by orange or red fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a glandular surface that secretes a sticky resin.</p>
<p>The resin has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties, including treating skin conditions and as an antiseptic.</p>
