<p>Primula involucrata, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the surrounding vegetation has emerged.</p>
<p>Primula involucrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
