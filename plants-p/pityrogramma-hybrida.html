                    <h1>Pityrogramma hybrida</h1>
<p>Pityrogramma hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly wavy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across suitable habitats.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are arranged along the margins of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
