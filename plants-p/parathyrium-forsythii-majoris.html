<p>Parathyrium forsythii-majoris, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the moist, shaded forests of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing rosette of dark green, leathery fronds that are adorned with small, yellowish-brown spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a sought-after specimen among botanical enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
