<p>Polypodium superficiale var. australiense, commonly known as the Australian wall fern, is a variant of the common wall fern native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The plant features fronds that are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, often curled appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia clustered in sori.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to the specific climatic conditions of its native habitat, contributing to its ecological significance in Australian flora.</p>
