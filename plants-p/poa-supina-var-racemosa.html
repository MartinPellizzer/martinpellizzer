<p>Poa supina var. racemosa, commonly known as the prostrate bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth on the ground, with slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover.</p>
