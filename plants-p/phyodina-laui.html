<p>Phyodina laui, commonly known as the golden star vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the warmer months. The leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while the plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
