                    <h1>Phoradendron falciferum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron falciferum, commonly known as the creeping mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in the southern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in length and are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces white or greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its roots form haustoria, which penetrate the host tree's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals.</p>
