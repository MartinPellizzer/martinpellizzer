<p>Phegopteris macrosora, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its expansive, floating fronds that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its fronds are divided into numerous pinnate segments, with each leaflet bearing small, toothed margins.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
