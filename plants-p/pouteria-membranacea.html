<p>It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody capsules containing edible seeds. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a dense, buttressed root system that helps it thrive in wet, nutrient-poor soils. Its fruit, known as a "capsule," contains up to 18 seeds, which are the seeds of the Brazil nut.</p>
<p>The plant plays a vital role in the ecosystem, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
