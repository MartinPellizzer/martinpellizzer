                    <h1>Primulina sclerophylla</h1>
<p>Primulina sclerophylla, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and its striking, orchid-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Its leaves are thick and leathery, an adaptation to its arid and exposed habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Primulina sclerophylla is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
