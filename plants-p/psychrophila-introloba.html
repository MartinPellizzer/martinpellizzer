                    <h1>Psychrophila introloba</h1>
<p>Psychrophila introloba, commonly known as the Antarctic hairgrass, is a hardy grass species adapted to extreme cold environments.</p>
<p>It is native to the Antarctic region and surrounding sub-Antarctic islands, where it thrives in harsh, icy conditions. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense, short blades that help insulate it from freezing temperatures. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of hair, which reduces water loss and protects against wind damage.</p>
<p>Psychrophila introloba plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its extreme habitat.</p>
