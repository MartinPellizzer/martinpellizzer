<p>Phaeoneuron dicellandroides, commonly known as the two-celled liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the order Marchantiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thalloid structure, which is typically flat and leafy, with a distinct upper and lower surface. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive system, producing both male and female reproductive structures on the same thallus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and ecological adaptability make it an important species in studies of early land plant evolution.</p>
