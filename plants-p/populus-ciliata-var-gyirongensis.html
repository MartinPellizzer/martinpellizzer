<p>Populus ciliata var. gyirongensis, commonly known as the Gyirong poplar, is a rare and endemic species native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive ciliate margin. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, typical of the Populus genus, which facilitate wind pollination. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a tendency to peel in thin layers.</p>
<p>This species thrives in moist, cool climates and is often found in mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 3,500 meters.</p>
