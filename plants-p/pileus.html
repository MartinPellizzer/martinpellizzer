                    <h1>Pileus</h1>
<p>Pileus, commonly known as the cap of a mushroom, is the upper, often umbrella-shaped structure that covers the stem and gills of the fruiting body.</p>
<p>It is a key feature used in the identification of mushroom species, varying in color, texture, and shape. The pileus may be smooth, sticky, or covered with tiny scales, and its appearance can change as the mushroom matures. In some species, the cap becomes more convex or flat over time.</p>
<p>The structure of the pileus plays a role in protecting the spore-bearing surface beneath it.</p>
