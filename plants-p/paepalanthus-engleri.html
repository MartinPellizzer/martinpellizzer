                    <h1>Paepalanthus engleri</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus engleri, commonly known as the Engler's pincushion cactus, is a unique species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly spines and compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the dry season, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a common adaptation to minimize water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Paepalanthus engleri is often found in rocky soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun exposure.</p>
