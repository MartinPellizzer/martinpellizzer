                    <h1>Polycarpon spicatum</h1>
<p>Polycarpon spicatum, commonly known as the spiked chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems that are covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
