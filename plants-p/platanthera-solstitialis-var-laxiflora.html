                    <h1>Platanthera solstitialis var. laxiflora</h1>
<p>Platanthera solstitialis var. laxiflora, commonly known as the loose-flowered marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and bogs in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, around the summer solstice, hence its scientific name. It has a fibrous root system and possesses specialized structures called pseudobulbs for storing nutrients.</p>
<p>This variety is less common than the typical form and is often found in acidic, moist environments.</p>
