                    <h1>Phoradendron spathulatum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron spathulatum, commonly known as the flat-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead relies on its green stems for photosynthesis, while drawing water and nutrients from its host through specialized roots. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, facilitating seed dispersal. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, forming dense clusters on its host.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host if left unchecked.</p>
