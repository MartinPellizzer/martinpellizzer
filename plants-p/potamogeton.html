<p>Potamogeton, commonly known as water milfoil, is a genus of aquatic plants found in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow waters and is characterized by its submerged or floating leaves, which are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in spike-like structures. Potamogeton species are important for water ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>They are also used in phytoremediation due to their ability to absorb pollutants from the water.</p>
