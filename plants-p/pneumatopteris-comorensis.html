                    <h1>Pneumatopteris comorensis</h1>
<p>Pneumatopteris comorensis, commonly known as the Comoro water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>The fronds are composed of small, serrated pinnae that aid in photosynthesis and gas exchange.</p>
