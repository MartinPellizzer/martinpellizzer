<p>Peperomia hydrocotyloides var. hydrocotyloides, commonly known as the water pepper, is a perennial herb native to wetland environments in tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy or swampy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet conditions, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil in waterlogged habitats.</p>
