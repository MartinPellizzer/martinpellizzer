                    <h1>Papaver somniferum var. rubellum</h1>
<p>Papaver somniferum var. rubellum, commonly known as the red poppy, is a variant of the opium poppy characterized by its striking red petals and a shorter stem compared to the standard opium poppy.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds used in both ornamental and agricultural contexts. Its flowers bloom in early summer, adding vibrant color to gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its botanical relation to the opium poppy, it is subject to legal restrictions in many regions.</p>
