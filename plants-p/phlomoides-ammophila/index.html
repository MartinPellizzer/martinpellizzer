                            <h1>Phlomoides Ammophila</h1>
<p>Phlomoides ammophila is a unique flowering plant known for its ability to thrive in sandy coastal environments. This species is often found in dunes and along shorelines where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing sand dunes. Its small, pink or purple flowers bloom in summer, adding a splash of color to the otherwise barren landscape. The plant is adapted to harsh conditions, including high winds and salt spray. Despite its resilience, it is considered rare and faces threats from human activity and climate change.</p>
