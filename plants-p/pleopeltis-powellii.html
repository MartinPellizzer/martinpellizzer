                    <h1>Pleopeltis powellii</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis powellii, commonly known as Powell's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is often found growing on cliffs or tree trunks. The plant has slender, wiry rhizomes and produces small, delicate fronds with a distinctive, pinnate structure. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its dry habitat.</p>
<p>This fern is adapted to low-nutrient soils and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth.</p>
