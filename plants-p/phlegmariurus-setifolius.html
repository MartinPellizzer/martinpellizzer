<p>Phlegmariurus setifolius, commonly known as the slender-leaf spikemoss, is a member of the family Lepidoziaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen moss-like plant that grows in moist, shaded environments, typically in temperate regions. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered at the tips of the stems and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Phlegmariurus setifolius plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
