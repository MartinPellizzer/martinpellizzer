                    <h1>Pterostylis crypta</h1>
<p>Pterostylis crypta, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small, leafless plant that produces a single, pale green to brownish flower with a distinctive pouch-like structure. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, as it lacks true leaves. Its habitat is typically in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
