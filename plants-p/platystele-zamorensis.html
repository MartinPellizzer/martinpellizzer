                    <h1>Platystele zamorensis</h1>
<p>Platystele zamorensis, commonly known as the Zamora's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, typically found growing on the trunks or branches of trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, white flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Platystele zamorensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
