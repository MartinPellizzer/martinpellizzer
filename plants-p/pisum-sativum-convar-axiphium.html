                    <h1>Pisum sativum convar. axiphium</h1>
<p>Pisum sativum convar. axiphium, commonly known as the wild pea, is a botanical variant of the pea species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing habit and small, pea-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces pods containing 2â€“5 seeds, which are typically smaller and more angular compared to those of cultivated peas. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found growing in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its genetic diversity and potential for hybridization with cultivated peas.</p>
