                    <h1>Polythecium andravinense</h1>
<p>Polythecium andravinense, commonly known as the Andravin's polythecium, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Polythecium genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring dense, velvety spore capsules that are typically clustered in compact structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest understories. Its spore dispersal mechanism is adapted for short-range propagation, relying on wind and occasional animal vectors.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
