                    <h1>Pellaea collina</h1>
<p>Pellaea collina, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>Pellaea collina is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging conditions.</p>
