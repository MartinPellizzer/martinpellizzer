<p>Pitcairnia alborubra, commonly known as the White-Red Pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the humid forests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, creating a striking contrast against the green foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture in its growing medium.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in many tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
