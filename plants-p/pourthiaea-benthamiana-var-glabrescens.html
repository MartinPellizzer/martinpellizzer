                    <h1>Pourthiaea benthamiana var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Pourthiaea benthamiana var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous benthamia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, though the varietal name "glabrescens" suggests a reduction or loss of hair compared to the typical species. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically yellow or white, arranged in composite heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
