<p>Patellocalamus gongshanensis, commonly known as the Gongshan grass, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, adapting to the cold and arid conditions of its habitat. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and forage for small animals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragility, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
