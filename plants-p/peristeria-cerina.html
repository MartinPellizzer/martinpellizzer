                    <h1>Peristeria cerina</h1>
<p>Peristeria cerina, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, waxy, white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
