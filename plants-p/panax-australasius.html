                    <h1>Panax australasius</h1>
<p>Panax australasius, commonly known as the Australian ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the rainforests of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, white, clustered flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its roots, similar to ginseng, are the primary part used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
