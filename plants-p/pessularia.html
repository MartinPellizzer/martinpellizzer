                    <h1>Pessularia</h1>
<p>Pessularia, commonly known as the "sensitive plant," is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in sandy or disturbed soils. Pessularia species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts.</p>
