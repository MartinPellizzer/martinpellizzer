<p>Populus alba var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the narrowleaf white poplar, is a variant of the white poplar species native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a distinct pyramidal growth habit, which gives it a more upright appearance compared to other poplar varieties.

It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found along riverbanks and in moist, temperate climates.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its unique form and seasonal interest.</p>
