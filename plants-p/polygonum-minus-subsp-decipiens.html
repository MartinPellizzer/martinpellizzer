<p>Polygonum minus subsp.</p>
<p>decipiens, commonly known as the false knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the buckwheat family, Polygonaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, which are typically borne in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The species is often confused with other Polygonum species due to its similar appearance and growth patterns.</p>
