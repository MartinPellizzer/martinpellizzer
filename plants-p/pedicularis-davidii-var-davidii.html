<p>Pedicularis davidii var. davidii, commonly known as the David's lousewort, is a herbaceous perennial native to the alpine regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its parasitic or hemiparasitic nature, though this species is primarily hemiparasitic, drawing some nutrients from its host plants. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, thriving in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in alpine flora.</p>
