<p>Polypodium soridens, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a creeping rhizome with dense, clustered fronds that are usually dark green and leathery in texture. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Polypodium soridens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings.</p>
