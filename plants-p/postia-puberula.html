                    <h1>Postia puberula</h1>
<p>Postia puberula, commonly known as the silky polypore, is a small, saprophytic fungus that grows on dead wood in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polyporaceae and is characterized by its white, velvety cap that becomes fibrous with age. The fruiting body is typically small, with a tough, leathery surface and a distinct, irregular shape. It is often found on fallen trees in forests, decomposing organic matter and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing surface is smooth and lacks a distinct stem, making it easily distinguishable from other similar species.</p>
