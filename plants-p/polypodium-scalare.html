<p>Polypodium scalare, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, strap-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically climbs using its rhizomes, which anchor it to trees or other structures. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium scalare thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
