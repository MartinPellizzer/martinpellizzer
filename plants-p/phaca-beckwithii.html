                    <h1>Phaca beckwithii</h1>
<p>Phaca beckwithii, commonly known as the Beckwith's phaca, is a rare and specialized plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies.</p>
