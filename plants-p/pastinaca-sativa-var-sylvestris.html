                    <h1>Pastinaca sativa var. sylvestris</h1>
<p>Pastinaca sativa var. sylvestris, commonly known as wild parsnip, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its hollow, ridged stems and compound leaves with a fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters, known as umbels, during its second year of growth. Its roots are typically white and fibrous, though they are not commonly harvested for culinary use.</p>
<p>Wild parsnip contains phototoxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals if the sap comes into contact with skin and is then exposed to sunlight.</p>
