                    <h1>Ptilepida odorata</h1>
<p>Ptilepida odorata, commonly known as the fragrant mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of its host, facilitating its spread. It is often found in temperate regions and is noted for its aromatic scent, which is most pronounced during the winter months.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
