                    <h1>Pachypodium × rauhii</h1>
<p>Pachypodium × rauhii, commonly known as the Madagascar palm hybrid, is a unique succulent native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features a thick, stem-like trunk with a dense cluster of spines at the top, resembling a palm tree. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, followed by red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its hybrid origin results from crosses between Pachypodium leari and Pachypodium ambongense, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
