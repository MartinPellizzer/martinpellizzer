                    <h1>Puschkinia</h1>
<p>Puschkinia, commonly known as scilla, is a genus of bulbous plants native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>These plants typically produce clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, often blooming in early spring. The leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often emerge after the flowers have faded. Puschkinia species are relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>They are popular in rock gardens and as ornamental plants due to their delicate appearance and long-lasting blooms.</p>
