                    <h1>Potentilla leucopolitana var. leucopolitanoides</h1>
<p>Potentilla leucopolitana var. leucopolitanoides, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
