                    <h1>Pyrus communis tomentosa</h1>
<p>Pyrus communis tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly apple tree, is a cultivar of the common apple tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white tomentose (fuzzy) coating on both the leaves and stems, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant is a deciduous tree that produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible apples in the fall. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its fruit.</p>
<p>The tomentose covering also helps to protect the plant from excessive moisture loss and pests.</p>
