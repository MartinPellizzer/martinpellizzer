<p>Pistia amazonica, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to the Amazon River basin.</p>
<p>It has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that emerge above the water surface. Its roots are submerged and help stabilize the water's surface, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Pistia amazonica is often used in water gardens and can be invasive in non-native environments.</p>
