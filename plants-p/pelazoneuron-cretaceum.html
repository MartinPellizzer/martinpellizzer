                    <h1>Pelazoneuron cretaceum</h1>
<p>Pelazoneuron cretaceum, commonly known as the Cretaceous fern, is a prehistoric plant that thrived during the Cretaceous period.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that were adapted for efficient photosynthesis in the dense, humid environments of ancient forests. The plant's structure suggests it was an aquatic or semi-aquatic species, likely growing near water bodies. Fossil records indicate that it played a significant role in the early development of modern ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its study provides valuable insights into the evolution of plant life during the Mesozoic era.</p>
