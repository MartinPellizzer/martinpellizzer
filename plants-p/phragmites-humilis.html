                    <h1>Phragmites humilis</h1>
<p>Phragmites humilis, commonly known as the narrowleaf common reed, is a perennial grass species native to wetland areas across the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow water and moist soils, often forming dense stands that stabilize shorelines. The plant has tall, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces fluffy, seed-bearing spikes during the summer months. It plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>However, it can also become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
