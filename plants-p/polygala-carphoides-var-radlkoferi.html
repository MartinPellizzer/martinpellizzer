                    <h1>Polygala carphoides var. radlkoferi</h1>
<p>Polygala carphoides var. radlkoferi, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Polygalaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale pink or white flowers that resemble spectral forms. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
