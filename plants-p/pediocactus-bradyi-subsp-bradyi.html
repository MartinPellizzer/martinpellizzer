<p>Pediocactus bradyi subsp.</p>
<p>bradyi, commonly known as the Brady's prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its globular to cylindrical stem, which is typically covered in spines and covered with a whitish, powdery coating called farina.</p>
