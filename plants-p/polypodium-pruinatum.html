<p>Polypodium pruinatum, commonly known as the powdered fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and contain spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Polypodium pruinatum make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies.</p>
