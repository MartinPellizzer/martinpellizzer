<p>Phlegmariurus flexibilis, commonly known as the flexible clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila. Phlegmariurus flexibilis is characterized by its flexible, branching stems that can bend without breaking, which aids in its survival in rocky habitats.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
