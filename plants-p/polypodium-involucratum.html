<p>Polypodium involucratum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that form a rosette shape, often growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and establish colonies over time. Its leaves are biennial, with the first year's fronds being sterile and the second year's producing spores.</p>
<p>Polypodium involucratum is well adapted to acidic soils and can thrive in areas with limited sunlight.</p>
