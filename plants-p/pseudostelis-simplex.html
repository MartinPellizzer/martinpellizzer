                <h1>Pseudostelis simplex</h1>
<p>Pseudostelis simplex, commonly known as the simple pseudostelis, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
