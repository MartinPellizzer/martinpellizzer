<p>Pabstiella tenera, commonly known as the slender pabstiella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
