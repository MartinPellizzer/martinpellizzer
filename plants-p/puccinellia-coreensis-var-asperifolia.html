                    <h1>Puccinellia coreensis var. asperifolia</h1>
<p>Puccinellia coreensis var. asperifolia, commonly known as roughleaf core grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are rough to the touch due to their dense, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland and saline environments, making it an important species for stabilizing coastal and marsh ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to harsh conditions contributes to its ecological significance in its native range.</p>
