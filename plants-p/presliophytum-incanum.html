<p>Presliophytum incanum, commonly known as the silver leaf cholla, is a succulent cactus native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branching structure composed of cylindrical, spiny stems that are covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by inconspicuous fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements.</p>
<p>The plant's unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
