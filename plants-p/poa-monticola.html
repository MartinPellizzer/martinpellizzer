                    <h1>Poa monticola</h1>
<p>Poa monticola, commonly known as the mountain grass or alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in high-altitude environments, including meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has slender, tufted culms and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Poa monticola is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife.</p>
