<p>Potentilla pteropoda, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Potentilla pteropoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates.</p>
