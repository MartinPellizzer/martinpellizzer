                    <h1>Pelecinus vulgaris</h1>
<p>Pelecinus vulgaris, commonly known as the narrow-winged beetle, is a member of the family Pelecanidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, slender body and long, tapering legs, which are adapted for life in aquatic environments. The plant-associated aspects of this species are minimal, as it is not a plant but an insect. However, it is often found in association with aquatic plants, where it lays its eggs.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves aquatic larvae and adult beetles that inhabit moist environments near water bodies.</p>
