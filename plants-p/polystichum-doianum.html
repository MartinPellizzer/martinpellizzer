                    <h1>Polystichum doianum</h1>
<p>Polystichum doianum, commonly known as the Doian's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant forms compact clumps and has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Polystichum doianum is often found in shaded, humid environments, making it a suitable plant for woodland gardens.</p>
