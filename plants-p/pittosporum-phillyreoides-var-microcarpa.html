<p>Pittosporum phillyreoides var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited pittosporum, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This variety is distinct from the typical form due to its smaller fruits and more compact growth habit.</p>
