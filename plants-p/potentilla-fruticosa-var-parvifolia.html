                    <h1>Potentilla fruticosa var. parvifolia</h1>
<p>Potentilla fruticosa var. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter, arranged in a dense, mat-like growth pattern. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with limited growing seasons.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover in harsh environments.</p>
