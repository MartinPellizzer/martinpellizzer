                    <h1>Purdiaea ekmanii</h1>
<p>Purdiaea ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekman's pincushion, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and striking, spiky inflorescences that resemble a pincushion. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale blue, bloom in late summer and attract various pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Purdiaea ekmanii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
