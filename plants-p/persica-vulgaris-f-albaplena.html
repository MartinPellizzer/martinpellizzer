<p>Persica vulgaris f. albaplena, commonly known as the white-flowered peach.</p>
<p>This is a floral variant of the peach tree, characterized by its fully white petals instead of the typical pink or red hues. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its fruit. The plant produces small, edible fruits similar to regular peaches, though they are often less flavorful.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
