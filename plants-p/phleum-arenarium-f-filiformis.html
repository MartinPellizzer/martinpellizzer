                    <h1>Phleum arenarium f. filiformis</h1>
<p>Phleum arenarium f. filiformis, commonly known as the silky bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, thread-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a soft, silky appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes or as a ground cover.</p>
