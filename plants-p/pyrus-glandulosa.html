                    <h1>Pyrus glandulosa</h1>
<p>Pyrus glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are often covered in glandular dots, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are pomes, typically small and edible, though they are not as well-known as those of other pear species.</p>
<p>Pyrus glandulosa is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks.</p>
