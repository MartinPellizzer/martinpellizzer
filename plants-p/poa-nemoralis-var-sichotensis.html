<p>Poa nemoralis var. sichotensis, commonly known as the Sichotian meadow grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass native to the temperate regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>This grass species typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
