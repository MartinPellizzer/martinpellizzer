<p>Polystichum pulchellum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are covered with a fine layer of silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polystichum pulchellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, upright growth habit.</p>
