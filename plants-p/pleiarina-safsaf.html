                    <h1>Pleiarina safsaf</h1>
<p>Pleiarina safsaf, commonly known as the Saharan spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and showy, cyathium-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, adapting to extreme desert conditions with deep root systems. Its leaves are usually narrow and waxy, reducing water loss, while its flowers are often yellow or green.</p>
<p>Despite its hardy nature, it is not commonly cultivated due to its toxic properties and preference for harsh environments.</p>
