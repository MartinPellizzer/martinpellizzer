<p>Phalaenopsis marriottiana, commonly known as the Marriott's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. The plant produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often resembling moths, which is characteristic of the Phalaenopsis genus. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and requires well-draining potting media.</p>
<p>This orchid is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for floral arrangements and indoor gardening.</p>
