                    <h1>Polygonum amphibium var. stipulaceum</h1>
<p>Polygonum amphibium var. stipulaceum, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh plantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features lanceolate to ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in loose spikes, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in moist soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas within its preferred habitat.</p>
