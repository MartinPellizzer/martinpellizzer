                    <h1>Pleurothyrium bilocellatum</h1>
<p>Pleurothyrium bilocellatum, commonly known as the Brazilian fern, is a species of fern native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a distinctive structure that allows for efficient photosynthesis in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
