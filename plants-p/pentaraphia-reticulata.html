<p>Pentaraphia reticulata, commonly known as the reticulate fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are often covered in a network of fine, reticulated veins, giving it its scientific name.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a complex structure that aids in photosynthesis in low-light conditions.</p>
