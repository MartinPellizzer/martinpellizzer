                    <h1>Poecilopteris requiniana</h1>
<p>Poecilopteris requiniana, commonly known as the "requiniana water fern," is a prehistoric plant belonging to the order Marattiopsida.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, complex fronds with a distinctive, often serrated or lobed structure. The plant thrived during the Late Cretaceous period and is known for its robust, vascular system that allowed it to grow in wet, tropical environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, were typically arranged in lines along the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is a key fossil plant used in paleobotanical studies to understand ancient ecosystems and climate conditions.</p>
