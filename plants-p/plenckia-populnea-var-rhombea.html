                    <h1>Plenckia populnea var. rhombea</h1>
<p>Plenckia populnea var. rhombea, commonly known as the diamondleaf poplar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped to diamond-shaped leaves, which are typically a vibrant green during the growing season. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is largely due to its unique leaf shape and seasonal color changes.</p>
