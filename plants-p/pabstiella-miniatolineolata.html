<p>Pabstiella miniatolineolata, commonly known as the miniature line-leafed fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Pterobryaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, intricately veined leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant exhibits a cryptic growth habit, often growing close to the ground in shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are usually clustered in a rosette formation, which helps protect the delicate structures from desiccation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
