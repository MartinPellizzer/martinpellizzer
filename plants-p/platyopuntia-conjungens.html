                    <h1>Platyopuntia conjungens</h1>
<p>Platyopuntia conjungens, commonly known as the clustered cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are segmented and covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a striking contrast to its green, spiky structure. Its leaves are reduced to small spines, and it thrives in arid environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>The clustered cholla is a slow-growing plant that is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique appearance.</p>
