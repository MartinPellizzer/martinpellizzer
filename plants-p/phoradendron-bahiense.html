                    <h1>Phoradendron bahiense</h1>
<p>Phoradendron bahiense, commonly known as the Bahamian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pink flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
