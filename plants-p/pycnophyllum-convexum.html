<p>Pycnophyllum convexum, commonly known as the convex-horned lichen, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, crustose thallus that forms a thick, leathery layer on rock surfaces, typically in shaded, humid environments. The plant exhibits a pale to dark green or yellowish coloration, with a convex, almost hemispherical shape that gives it its common name. It lacks distinct rhizines and is often found on limestone or sandstone substrates in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Pycnophyllum convexum plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
