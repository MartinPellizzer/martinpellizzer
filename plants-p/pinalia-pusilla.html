                    <h1>Pinalia pusilla</h1>
<p>Pinalia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf pincushion cactus, is a small, flowering cactus native to the deserts of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular stem covered in dense, spiny areoles, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise harsh appearance. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to arid environments.</p>
<p>Pinalia pusilla is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique shape and resilience.</p>
