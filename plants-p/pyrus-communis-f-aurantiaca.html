<p>Pyrus communis f. aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden crabapple, is a cultivar of the common crabapple tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant orange to yellow foliage, which provides striking visual interest throughout the growing season. The leaves are typically broad and ovate, with a smooth margin and a glossy texture. While it produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, its most notable feature is the showy color of its leaves.</p>
<p>This ornamental variety is often used in gardens for its aesthetic value rather than for fruit production.</p>
