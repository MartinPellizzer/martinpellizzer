                    <h1>Prosopis alba</h1>
<p>Prosopis alba, commonly known as the white mesquite, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate and shed during dry seasons. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Prosopis alba is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and livestock, as well as playing a role in soil stabilization.</p>
