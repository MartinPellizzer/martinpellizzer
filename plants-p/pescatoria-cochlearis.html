                    <h1>Pescatoria cochlearis</h1>
<p>Pescatoria cochlearis, commonly known as the spiral shell plant, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its spirally coiled leaves that resemble a snail's shell.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments with soft, nutrient-rich substrates. The plant's leaves are typically green and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss. Pescatoria cochlearis is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its distinctive morphology makes it a subject of interest in both botanical studies and ecological research.</p>
