<p>Phegopteris dryopteris subsp.</p>
<p>robertiana, commonly known as the Robert's wood fern, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in kidney-shaped groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a distinctive and valuable component of temperate forest ecosystems.</p>
