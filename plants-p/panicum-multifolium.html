<p>Panicum multifolium, commonly known as purple lovegrass, is a warm-season grass native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its striking purple to reddish-brown foliage that becomes more pronounced during the late summer and fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, Panicum multifolium is well-suited for xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>
