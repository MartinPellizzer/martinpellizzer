                    <h1>Plantago remotiflora</h1>
<p>Plantago remotiflora, commonly known as the distant-flower plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces a tall, flowering stem that bears dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its seeds are encased in a sticky, fleshy covering that aids in dispersal by clinging to animals or clothing.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its adaptability to harsh conditions and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
