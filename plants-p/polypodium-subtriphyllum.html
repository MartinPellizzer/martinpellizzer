<p>Polypodium subtriphyllum, commonly known as the three-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically exhibit a three-lobed structure, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
