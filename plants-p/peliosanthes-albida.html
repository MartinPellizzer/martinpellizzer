                    <h1>Peliosanthes albida</h1>
<p>Peliosanthes albida, commonly known as the white sand orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the late spring or early summer. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained, sandy soil, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from habitat destruction, it is considered endangered.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations and role in its native ecosystem.</p>
