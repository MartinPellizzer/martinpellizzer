                    <h1>Phenax rugosus</h1>
<p>Phenax rugosus, commonly known as the roughleaf fenax, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rugged, hairy leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its unique leaf structure helps it retain moisture, adapting it to its wetland habitat.</p>
<p>Phenax rugosus plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to humid environments.</p>
