                    <h1>Placus procerus</h1>
<p>Placus procerus, commonly known as the tall spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has smooth, green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care.</p>
