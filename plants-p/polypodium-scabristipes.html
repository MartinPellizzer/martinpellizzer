                    <h1>Polypodium scabristipes</h1>
<p>Polypodium scabristipes, commonly known as the scaly holly fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds with a distinctive scaly texture on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that contribute to its dense, bushy appearance.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproduction in moist, tropical climates.</p>
