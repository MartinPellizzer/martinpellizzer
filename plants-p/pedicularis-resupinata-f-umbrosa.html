                    <h1>Pedicularis resupinata f. umbrosa</h1>
<p>Pedicularis resupinata f. umbrosa, commonly known as the shadowy lousewort, is a unique botanical variant of the lousewort genus.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions. The plant features spurred flowers that are usually pink or purple, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture in its cool, humid habitat.</p>
<p>This form is distinguished by its more subdued coloration and compact growth habit compared to other Pedicularis species.</p>
