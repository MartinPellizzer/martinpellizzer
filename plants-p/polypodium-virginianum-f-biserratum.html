<p>Polypodium virginianum f. biserratum, commonly known as the Appalachian shield fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a serrated margin that is more pronounced in this form.
