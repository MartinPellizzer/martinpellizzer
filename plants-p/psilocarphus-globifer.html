<p>Psilocarphus globifer, commonly known as the globe-fruit coralplant, is a unique member of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, coral-like inflorescences that produce small, fleshy fruits. The plant is native to tropical regions of Africa and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, often with a waxy texture.</p>
<p>While not psychoactive, it shares some morphological traits with hallucinogenic fungi, leading to occasional confusion in botanical classification.</p>
