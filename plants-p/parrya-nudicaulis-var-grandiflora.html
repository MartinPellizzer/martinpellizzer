                    <h1>Parrya nudicaulis var. grandiflora</h1>
<p>Parrya nudicaulis var. grandiflora, commonly known as the grandiflora parrya, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy stems that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
