                    <h1>Phoradendron rugulosum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron rugulosum, commonly known as the roughleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a rough, waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in small groups, followed by small, fleshy berries that serve as a food source for birds. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing some photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by supporting bird populations and contributing to forest biodiversity.</p>
