                    <h1>Polypodium amoenum var. xerophyticum</h1>
<p>Polypodium amoenum var. xerophyticum, commonly known as the desert huperzia, is a terrestrial fern that thrives in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are adapted to conserve moisture. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and establish colonies in harsh conditions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its resilience and is often found in regions with low rainfall and high temperatures.</p>
