<p>Persicaria humboldtiana, commonly known as the Humboldt knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, slightly hairy leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species.</p>
