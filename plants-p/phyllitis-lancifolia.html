<p>Phyllitis lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water clover, is a species of aquatic fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern along its stems. Its rhizomes help anchor it to the substrate while also facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Phyllitis lancifolia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
