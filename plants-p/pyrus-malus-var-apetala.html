                    <h1>Pyrus malus var. apetala</h1>
<p>Pyrus malus var. apetala, commonly known as the apple tree with no petals, is a botanical variant of the apple tree characterized by its unique floral structure.</p>
<p>Unlike typical apple blossoms, this variety lacks the usual petal layers, resulting in a simpler, more compact flower. It is primarily found in specific regions where its genetic traits have been naturally selected over time. The plant retains the fruiting capabilities of the standard apple tree, producing edible apples despite its floral anomaly.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its distinct morphological features.</p>
