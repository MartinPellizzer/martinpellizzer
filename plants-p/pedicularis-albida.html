                    <h1>Pedicularis albida</h1>
<p>Pedicularis albida, commonly known as the white monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically tubular in shape, with a distinctive hooded lip. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive species, often found in remote, less disturbed environments.</p>
