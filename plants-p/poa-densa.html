                    <h1>Poa densa</h1>
<p>Poa densa, commonly known as dense meadow grass, is a cool-season grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often found in lawns and pastures. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous and wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Poa densa is valued for its fine texture and ability to form a dense sod, making it a popular choice for ornamental and turfgrass applications.</p>
