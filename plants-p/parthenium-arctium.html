                    <h1>Parthenium arctium</h1>
<p>Parthenium arctium, commonly known as common burrweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It grows up to 1 meter tall, featuring erect, hairy stems and alternate leaves that are heart-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into spiny, burr-like fruits, which are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in fields, and in waste areas.</p>
<p>Parthenium arctium is considered a weed in many regions but has historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>
