                    <h1>Panax ginseng f. angustatus</h1>
<p>Panax ginseng f. angustatus, commonly known as narrow-leaved ginseng, is a rare variant of the ginseng plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrower, more elongated leaves compared to the typical ginseng species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and red berries, which are typical of the Araliaceae family. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is considered a valuable and endangered plant in traditional medicine.</p>
