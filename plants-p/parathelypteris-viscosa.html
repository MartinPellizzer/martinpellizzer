                    <h1>Parathelypteris viscosa</h1>
<p>Parathelypteris viscosa, commonly known as the sticky bladder fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green fronds that are often covered with a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The sticky coating on its fronds may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores or aid in water retention.</p>
