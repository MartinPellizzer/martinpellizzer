                    <h1>Pilosella marginalis</h1>
<p>Pilosella marginalis, commonly known as the marginal hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry meadows, rocky soils, and open woodlands across Europe and parts of Asia. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Pilosella marginalis is often found in disturbed habitats and can spread through rhizomes, making it a common weed in some regions.</p>
