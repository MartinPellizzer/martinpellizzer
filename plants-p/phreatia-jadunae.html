<p>Phreatia jadunae, commonly known as the Kaduna orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Nigeria.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, strap-shaped leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on aerial roots for nutrient absorption. Its flowers, which bloom in yellow and green hues, are adapted to attract specific pollinators such as bees and wasps.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Phreatia jadunae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
