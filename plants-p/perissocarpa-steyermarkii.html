<p>Perissocarpa steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's perissocarpa, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its unique fruit structure, known as a perissocarp, which is a one-seed fruit with a fleshy, persistent calyx. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical forests, and requires specific soil conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
