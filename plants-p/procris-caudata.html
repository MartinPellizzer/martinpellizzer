                    <h1>Procris caudata</h1>
<p>Procris caudata, commonly known as the slender coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a spike, which are adapted for pollination by insects. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, Procris caudata is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
