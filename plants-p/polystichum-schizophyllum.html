<p>Polystichum schizophyllum, commonly known as the split fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds, which are divided into two rows of pinnae, giving it a distinctive appearance. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat. This fern thrives in shady, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to add texture to shaded garden spaces.</p>
