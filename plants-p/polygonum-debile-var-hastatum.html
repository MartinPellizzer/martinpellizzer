<p>Polygonum debile var. hastatum, commonly known as the slender knotweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are typically lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface and a reddish or purplish tinge. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions.</p>
