                    <h1>Phoradendron johnstonii</h1>
<p>Phoradendron johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also deriving some photosynthetic ability from its own small leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its growth is slow, and it forms dense clusters on the host, sometimes causing structural stress.</p>
<p>The botanical study of Phoradendron johnstonii provides insights into parasitic plant ecology and host-plant interactions.</p>
