<p>Platychaete villosa, commonly known as the hairy flatweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Platychaete villosa is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides, where it thrives in moist, well-drained conditions.</p>
