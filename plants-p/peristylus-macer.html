                    <h1>Peristylus macer</h1>
<p>Peristylus macer, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and white, waxy flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, are a food source for birds and other animals.</p>
<p>Peristylus macer is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in warm, humid climates.</p>
