                <h1>Polypodium beddomei</h1>
<p>Polypodium beddomei, commonly known as the Beddome's rock fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
