                    <h1>Polypodium falciforme</h1>
<p>Polypodium falciforme, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, arching fronds that resemble a sword, typically reaching lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in humid environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in shaded areas. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi-directionally pinnate, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that are often curled when young.</p>
