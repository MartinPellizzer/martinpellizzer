<p>Paspalum stoloniferum, commonly known as mat grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth habit, allowing it to spread aggressively across the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Paspalum stoloniferum is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
