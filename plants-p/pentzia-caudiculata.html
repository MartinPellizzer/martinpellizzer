                    <h1>Pentzia caudiculata</h1>
<p>Pentzia caudiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fig, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Pentzia caudiculata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
