<p>Portalesia procumbens, commonly known as the creeping portalesia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Portalesia procumbens is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species in high-altitude environments.</p>
