<p>Potentilla frigida f. condensata, commonly known as the dense potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with numerous stems arising from a central base. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, silvery coating, which helps reduce water loss in cold climates.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
