<p>Pinalia merapiensis, commonly known as the Merapi mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blooms that typically appear in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Pinalia merapiensis is considered an endangered species.</p>
