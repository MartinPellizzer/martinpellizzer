<p>Paronychia brevicuspis, commonly known as the small-cusped bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually simple and opposite, with small, rounded teeth along the margins.</p>
<p>Paronychia brevicuspis is a carnivorous plant that relies on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
