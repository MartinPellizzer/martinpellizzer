                    <h1>Psilotrichum axillare</h1>
<p>Psilotrichum axillare, commonly known as the axillary psilotrichum, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces sporangia in clusters at the base of the leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native range.</p>
