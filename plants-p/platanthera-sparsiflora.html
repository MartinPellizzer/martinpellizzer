                    <h1>Platanthera sparsiflora</h1>
<p>Platanthera sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered twayblade, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and wetlands. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
