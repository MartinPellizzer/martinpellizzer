<p>Perymenium chalarolepis, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking yellow petals and a central white or yellowish star-shaped structure, which gives it its common name. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from decaying organic matter in the forest floor.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
