                    <h1>Pinus taiwanensis var. fragilissima</h1>
<p>Pinus taiwanensis var. fragilissima, commonly known as the Taiwan fir variant, is a rare and unique variant of the Taiwan fir, native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its distinctive, fragrant needles that are shorter and more delicate than those of the typical Taiwan fir. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found at higher elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
