<p>Paspalum agnesiae, commonly known as the Agnesia paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments or along the edges of freshwater bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ecological importance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
