<p>Pleurothallis blancoi, commonly known as the Blanco's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
