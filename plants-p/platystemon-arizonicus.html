<p>Platystemon arizonicus, commonly known as Arizona plume or Arizona ghostflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as limestone soils and desert environments. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Platystemon arizonicus is adapted to survive in extreme climates, making it a unique example of desert flora.</p>
