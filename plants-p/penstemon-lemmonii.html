<p>Penstemon lemmonii, commonly known as Lemmon's beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and often covered in fine white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Penstemon lemmonii is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
