<p>Polypodium gibbosum, commonly known as the curled fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit. The plant has leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive curled appearance, which helps it conserve moisture. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Polypodium gibbosum thrives in humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in shaded, moist areas.</p>
