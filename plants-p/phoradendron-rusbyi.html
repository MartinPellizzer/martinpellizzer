<p>Phoradendron rusbyi, commonly known as the rust-colored mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered together. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it provides nectar for pollinators like bees and birds. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>This species plays a unique role in its ecosystem by influencing host tree health and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
