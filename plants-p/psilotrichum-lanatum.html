                    <h1>Psilotrichum lanatum</h1>
<p>Psilotrichum lanatum, commonly known as the silky psilotum, is a unique fern-like plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense, instead possessing structures called rhizomes and sporophylls. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are borne on specialized leaves and produce spores for propagation.</p>
