<p>Pennilabium lampongense, commonly known as the Lampong orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy coating to help retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pennilabium lampongense is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
