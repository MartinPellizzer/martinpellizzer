<p>Portulaca obtusifolia, commonly known as bluntleaf moss rose, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange, typically blooming throughout the summer months. Its succulent nature makes it well-suited for rock gardens and containers, as it requires minimal water and can thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
