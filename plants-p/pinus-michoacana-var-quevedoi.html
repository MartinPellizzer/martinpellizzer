                    <h1>Pinus michoacana var. quevedoi</h1>
<p>Pinus michoacana var. quevedoi, commonly known as the Quevedoi pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the highlands of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The cones of this species are small and often clustered, with scales that open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
