                    <h1>Poa semiverticillata</h1>
<p>Poa semiverticillata, commonly known as the narrowleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
