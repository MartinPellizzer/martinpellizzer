<p>Panicum arizonicum var. majus, commonly known as Arizona grass or desert grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. It produces fluffy, oat-like seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal, aiding in its propagation across open landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a component of native plant gardens.</p>
