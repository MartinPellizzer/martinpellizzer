<p>Polystichum sparsum, commonly known as the sparse cliff fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Polystichum sparsum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in shady, moist environments.</p>
