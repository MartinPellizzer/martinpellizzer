<p>Pteracanthus mekongensis, commonly known as the Mekong water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Mekong River basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments with ample sunlight. Its reproductive structures are submerged, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat degradation, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
