<p>Puccinellia dusenii, commonly known as the desert grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Puccinellia dusenii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
