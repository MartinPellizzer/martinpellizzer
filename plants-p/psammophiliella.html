<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and is adapted to arid and sandy environments. The plants typically have small, lance-shaped leaves and produce clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers. They are native to regions such as North Africa, the Middle East, and parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>Psammophiliella species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
