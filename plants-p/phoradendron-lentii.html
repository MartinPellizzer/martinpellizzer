                    <h1>Phoradendron lentii</h1>
<p>Phoradendron lentii, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Caribbean, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant forms a dense, evergreen shrub with small, oval leaves and white or pink flowers. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain sticky seeds that adhere to birds, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in tropical ecosystems by supporting various wildlife species.</p>
