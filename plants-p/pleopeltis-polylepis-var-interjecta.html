                    <h1>Pleopeltis polylepis var. interjecta</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis polylepis var. interjecta, commonly known as the interjecta fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often cascade from tree branches. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests, where it attaches itself to bark or other surfaces. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a finely divided structure, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by subtle variations in leaf shape and coloration compared to the typical form of P. polylepis.</p>
