                    <h1>Parodia camargensis var. castanea</h1>
<p>Parodia camargensis var. castanea, commonly known as the Castanea Parodia, is a rare and unique cactus species native to the arid regions of Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense coating of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces striking, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a dramatic visual contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
