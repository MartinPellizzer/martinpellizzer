                    <h1>Pyrus saxicola</h1>
<p>Pyrus saxicola, commonly known as the saxicolous pear, is a small, deciduous tree or shrub native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in crevices and on steep slopes, adapting to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture, while its bark is rugged and fissured.</p>
<p>Pyrus saxicola is valued for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded mountainous areas.</p>
