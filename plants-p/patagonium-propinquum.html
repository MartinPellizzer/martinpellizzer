<p>Patagonium propinquum, commonly known as the Patagonian dwarf grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
