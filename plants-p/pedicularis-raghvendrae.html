                    <h1>Pedicularis raghvendrae</h1>
<p>Pedicularis raghvendrae, commonly known as the Raghvendra's lousewort, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its parasitic nature and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces striking violet or red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
