                    <h1>Pterostylis daintreana</h1>
<p>Pterostylis daintreana, commonly known as the Daintree rainforest orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the subtropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, leafless stem and a single, often pale green or yellowish flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments under the canopy of tall trees. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, primarily thynnid wasps, which are attracted to the orchid's nectar.</p>
<p>This orchid is a rare and specialized species, reflecting the unique biodiversity of the Daintree region.</p>
