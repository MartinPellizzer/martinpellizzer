<p>Peltiera nitida, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, almost velvety appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, a typical feature of the carrot family.</p>
<p>Peltiera nitida is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
