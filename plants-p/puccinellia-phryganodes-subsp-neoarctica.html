<p>Puccinellia phryganodes subsp.</p>
<p>neoarctica, commonly known as the Arctic puccinellia, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically grows in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is an important component of tundra vegetation and plays a role in stabilizing soil in polar ecosystems.</p>
