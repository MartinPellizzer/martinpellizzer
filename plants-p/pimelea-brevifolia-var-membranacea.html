                    <h1>Pimelea brevifolia var. membranacea</h1>
<p>Pimelea brevifolia var. membranacea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistflower, is a low-growing shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming from late winter to early spring. The leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
