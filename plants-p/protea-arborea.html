                    <h1>Protea arborea</h1>
<p>Protea arborea, commonly known as the silver tree, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, dark green foliage that often has a silvery appearance due to the presence of fine, white hairs. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences that consist of a central cone surrounded by numerous pale yellow to white flowers. These inflorescences are not true flowers but rather modified leaves called bracts, which are often mistaken for petals.</p>
<p>Protea arborea thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and mountainous regions, making it a resilient and ornamental plant in its native habitat.</p>
