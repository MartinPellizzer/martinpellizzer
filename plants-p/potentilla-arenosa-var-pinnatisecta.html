                    <h1>Potentilla arenosa var. pinnatisecta</h1>
<p>Potentilla arenosa var. pinnatisecta, commonly known as the sandstone potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The leaves are finely divided into narrow, thread-like segments, giving the plant a feathery appearance. It produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
