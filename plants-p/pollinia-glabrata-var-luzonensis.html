The plant typically grows in montane forest habitats, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
