<p>Polypodium moniliforme var. minus, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'minus' distinguishes it from the typical variety by its smaller, more slender fronds and reduced spore production.</p>
