<p>Potamogeton × biwaensis, commonly known as the Lake Biwa hybrid pondweed, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Potamogeton acutiflorus and Potamogeton crispus.</p>
<p>It is native to Japan, specifically found in the Lake Biwa region, where it thrives in freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations that make it distinct from its parent species.</p>
