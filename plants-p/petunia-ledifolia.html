<p>Petunia ledifolia, commonly known as the trailing petunia, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including purple, blue, and white. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and containers.</p>
<p>Petunia ledifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
