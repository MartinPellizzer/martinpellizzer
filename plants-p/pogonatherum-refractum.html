                    <h1>Pogonatherum refractum</h1>
<p>Pogonatherum refractum, commonly known as the narrowleaf flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense clusters, with slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>Pogonatherum refractum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
