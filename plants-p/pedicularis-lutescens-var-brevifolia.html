                    <h1>Pedicularis lutescens var. brevifolia</h1>
<p>Pedicularis lutescens var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved yellow lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Pedicularis, which is part of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family. This variant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients, and it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
