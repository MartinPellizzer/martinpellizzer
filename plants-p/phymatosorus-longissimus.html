<p>Phymatosorus longissimus, commonly known as the long-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, arching fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate-shaped pinnae that are densely packed.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sori, which are clustered in lines along the margins of the pinnae.</p>
