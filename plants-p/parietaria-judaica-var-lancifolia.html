                    <h1>Parietaria judaica var. lancifolia</h1>
<p>Parietaria judaica var. lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wallweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky walls, stream banks, and woodland areas. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture and produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its leaves are often covered in fine, stinging hairs that can cause skin irritation.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other parietaria species and is often found growing in similar habitats.</p>
