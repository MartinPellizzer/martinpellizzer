                    <h1>Puccinellia paupercula var. alaskana</h1>
<p>Puccinellia paupercula var. alaskana, commonly known as the Alaska poorgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh, cold environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats where the climate is extreme. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, helping it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains tiny, wind-pollinated flowers typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions.</p>
