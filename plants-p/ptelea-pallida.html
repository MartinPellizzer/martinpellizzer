                    <h1>Ptelea pallida</h1>
<p>Ptelea pallida, commonly known as the paleleaf sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to full sun.</p>
<p>Ptelea pallida is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
