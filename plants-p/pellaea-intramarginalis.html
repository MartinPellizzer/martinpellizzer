                    <h1>Pellaea intramarginalis</h1>
<p>Pellaea intramarginalis, commonly known as the margin-leaf fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its dark green, leathery fronds. The leaves are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, with the margins often bearing small, tooth-like projections. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
