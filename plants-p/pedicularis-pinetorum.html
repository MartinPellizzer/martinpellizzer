<p>Pedicularis pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its hemiparasitic nature.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as pine forests, where it attaches to the roots of host trees to obtain nutrients. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that range in color from purple to red, often resembling small, delicate lanterns. Its leaves are opposite and often reduced, with a fleshy texture adapted to its parasitic lifestyle.</p>
<p>Pedicularis pinetorum is a rare and specialized species, often found in specific ecological niches across the northern hemisphere.</p>
