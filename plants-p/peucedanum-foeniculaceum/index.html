                            <h1>Peucedanum Foeniculaceum</h1>
<p>Wild fennel, scientifically known as Peucedanum foeniculaceum, is a hardy herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found growing along roadsides and in disturbed habitats. With its feathery foliage and distinctive licorice-like aroma, it has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and cooking. The plant's seeds are not only edible but also valued for their flavor and medicinal properties. Its resilience and versatility make it an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts.</p>
