<p>Potentilla gelida var. genuina, commonly known as the Arctic cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, harsh environments, often found in tundra and rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its hardiness and ability to survive in extreme climatic conditions.</p>
