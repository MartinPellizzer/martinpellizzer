                    <h1>Phragmites dioicus</h1>
<p>Phragmites dioicus, commonly known as common reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, jointed stems and dense clusters of feathery, greenish-gray inflorescences. The plant is highly invasive in many regions, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks, allowing it to spread rapidly across wetlands.</p>
<p>Phragmites dioicus plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
