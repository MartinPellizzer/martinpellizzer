                    <h1>Panicum unguiculatum</h1>
<p>Panicum unguiculatum, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
