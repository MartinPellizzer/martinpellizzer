<p>Pancratium saharae, commonly known as the Sahara torch flower, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of the Sahara Desert, where it thrives in sandy soils with minimal rainfall. The plant produces tall, slender stems topped with vibrant yellow flowers that resemble torches, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Pancratium saharae is valued for its ornamental appeal and has cultural significance in some desert communities.</p>
