<p>Puccinellia festuciformis subsp.</p>
<p>convoluta, commonly known as curled puccinellia, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in saline or alkaline environments.</p>
<p>The plant has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes.</p>
