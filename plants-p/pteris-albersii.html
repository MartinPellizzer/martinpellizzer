<p>Pteris albersii, commonly known as the albert's sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in its ecological interactions.</p>
