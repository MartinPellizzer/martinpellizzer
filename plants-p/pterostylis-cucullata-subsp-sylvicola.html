                    <h1>Pterostylis cucullata subsp. sylvicola</h1>
<p>Pterostylis cucullata subsp.</p>
<p>sylvicola, commonly known as the forest helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it forms a dense, low-growing rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, slender flowering stem that bears a single, pale green to white, helmet-shaped flower. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insect species, particularly wasps, due to their morphological and chemical mimicry.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its habitat preference and subtle differences in leaf and floral morphology compared to other members of the Pterostylis genus.</p>
