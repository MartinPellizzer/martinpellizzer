                    <h1>Polygala petitiana var. abercornensis</h1>
<p>Polygala petitiana var. abercornensis, commonly known as the Abercorn polygala, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous perennial with delicate, spire-like inflorescences that bear small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to saline and well-drained conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight bluish hue, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
