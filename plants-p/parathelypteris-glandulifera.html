                    <h1>Parathelypteris glandulifera</h1>
<p>Parathelypteris glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive glandular surface. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, a common reproductive feature among ferns.</p>
<p>The glandular structures on its leaves may play a role in water retention or defense against herbivores.</p>
