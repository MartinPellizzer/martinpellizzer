                    <h1>Potentilla fruticosa var. pumila</h1>
<p>Potentilla fruticosa var. pumila, commonly known as dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover in cold climates.</p>
