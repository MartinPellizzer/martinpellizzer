                    <h1>Phoradendron randiae</h1>
<p>Phoradendron randiae, commonly known as the Christmas star, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season, adding a striking visual contrast to its host tree. Its leaves are typically opposite and oval-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Phoradendron randiae plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing the growth and distribution of its host species.</p>
