<p>Pyrus cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart pears in late summer. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for small gardens or as a specimen plant.</p>
<p>Pyrus cordata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
