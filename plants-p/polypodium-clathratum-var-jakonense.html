                    <h1>Polypodium clathratum var. jakonense</h1>
<p>Polypodium clathratum var. jakonense, commonly known as the Karon holly fern, is a variant of the common holly fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that resemble the leaves of a holly plant. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
