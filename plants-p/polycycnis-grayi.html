                    <h1>Polycycnis grayi</h1>
<p>Polycycnis grayi, commonly known as the Gray's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its adaptation to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a unique subject of study in plant ecology.</p>
