<p>Protomegabaria stapfiana, commonly known as the Stapf's giant fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure with sporangia arranged in clusters on the undersides of its leaves. Its botanical significance lies in its evolutionary adaptations to humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
