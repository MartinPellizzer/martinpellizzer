<p>Polypodium smithii, commonly known as the Smith's water fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in swampy areas. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizome is creeping and helps it spread along the ground, forming dense mats in its natural habitat.</p>
