                    <h1>Polycardia libera</h1>
<p>Polycardia libera, commonly known as the wandering heart plant, is a rare flowering species native to the subtropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and heart-shaped leaves, which give it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers bloom in late spring and are pollinated primarily by bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Polycardia libera is now classified as an endangered species.</p>
