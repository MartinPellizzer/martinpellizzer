                    <h1>Phragmites communis f. repens</h1>
<p>Phragmites communis f. repens, commonly known as the creeping common reed, is a variant of the common reed that exhibits a more spreading growth habit.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous root system, which allows it to form dense colonies along wetlands and water edges. The plant produces tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It blooms with small, fluffy panicles that release wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its rapid spread.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in disturbed or saline soils and is highly adaptable to various aquatic environments.</p>
