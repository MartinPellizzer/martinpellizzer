                    <h1>Procris littoralis</h1>
<p>Procris littoralis, commonly known as the coastal wickweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sandy or rocky soils along shorelines.</p>
<p>Procris littoralis plays a role in preventing coastal erosion and provides habitat for various small invertebrates.</p>
