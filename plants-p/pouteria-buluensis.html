<p>Pouteria buluensis, commonly known as the Bulu's pouteria, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of western Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by spherical fruits with a thick, waxy peel. The fruit contains a single large seed enclosed in a sweet, sticky pulp, which is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Pouteria buluensis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
