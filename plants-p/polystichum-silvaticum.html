<p>Polystichum silvaticum, commonly known as the woodland shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are clustered in distinct groups.</p>
<p>Polystichum silvaticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
