                    <h1>Platanthera tipuloides f. sibirica</h1>
<p>Platanthera tipuloides f. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to northern regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in wet, nutrient-poor habitats such as bogs and fens, where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. The plant produces showy, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the moist, acidic conditions of its environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
