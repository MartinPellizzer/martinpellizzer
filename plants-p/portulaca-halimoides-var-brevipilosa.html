                    <h1>Portulaca halimoides var. brevipilosa</h1>
<p>Portulaca halimoides var. brevipilosa, commonly known as the short-stemmed moss rose, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread readily across the ground. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom throughout the summer months. Its leaves are typically rounded and covered in a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
