                    <h1>Pluchea ovalis</h1>
<p>Pluchea ovalis, commonly known as the ovalleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant attaches itself to host trees, deriving some of its nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain insects and birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can sometimes cause stress to its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
