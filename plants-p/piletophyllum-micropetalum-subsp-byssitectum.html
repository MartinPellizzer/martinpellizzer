<p>Piletophyllum micropetalum subsp.</p>
<p>byssitectum, commonly known as the silky-leaved rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific alpine and rocky habitats. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful monitoring.</p>
