                    <h1>Pedicularis anas var. tibetica</h1>
<p>Pedicularis anas var. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange with yellow markings, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
