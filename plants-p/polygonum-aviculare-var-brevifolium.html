                    <h1>Polygonum aviculare var. brevifolium</h1>
<p>Polygonum aviculare var. brevifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved smartweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, alternate leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, three-lobed seed capsules. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in wet meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a common weed in agricultural and natural habitats.</p>
