                    <h1>Pedicularis sibthorpii var. eriantha</h1>
<p>Pedicularis sibthorpii var. eriantha, commonly known as the woolly lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces striking orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important subject in botanical studies of alpine ecosystems.</p>
