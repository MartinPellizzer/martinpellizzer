                    <h1>Pentameris cyatophora</h1>
<p>Pentameris cyatophora, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. It thrives in still or slow-moving water and is often found in wetlands and ponds.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor aquatic habitats.</p>
