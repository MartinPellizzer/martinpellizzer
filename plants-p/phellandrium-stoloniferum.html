<p>Phellandrium stoloniferum, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to Australia, characterized by its wiry, sprawling stems and small, yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is known for its aromatic foliage, which emits a strong, spicy scent. The plant typically grows in coastal regions and sandy soils, showing a preference for well-drained conditions. Its stolons allow it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats that help stabilize dunes.</p>
<p>The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its adaptability in harsh environments.</p>
