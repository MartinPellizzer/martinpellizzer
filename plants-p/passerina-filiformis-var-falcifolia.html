<p>Passerina filiformis var. falcifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf pasqueflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, filiform stems and small, falcate (sickle-shaped) leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
