                    <h1>Perymenium cervantesii</h1>
<p>Perymenium cervantesii, commonly known as the Cervantes' bladderworts, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for trapping aquatic invertebrates, a feature typical of its carnivorous relatives. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor freshwater environments, often found in shallow, still waters. Its leaves are submerged, while its flowers emerge above the water surface, displaying a unique blue-violet color.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
