                    <h1>Ptychosperma macrocerum</h1>
<p>Ptychosperma macrocerum, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large, ancient plant native to the tropical rainforests of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, fern-like leaves and a stout, unbranched trunk that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in association with other rainforest flora.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
