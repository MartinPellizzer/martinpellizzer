                    <h1>Phleum pratense var. praecox</h1>
<p>Phleum pratense var. praecox, commonly known as early timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This variety blooms earlier than the standard timothy grass, producing small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system makes it a valuable forage plant for livestock and an important component of ecological restoration projects.</p>
