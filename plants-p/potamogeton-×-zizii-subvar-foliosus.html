                    <h1>Potamogeton × zizii subvar. foliosus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × zizii subvar. foliosus, commonly known as the broad-leaved pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Potamogeton zizii and Potamogeton foliosus.</p>
<p>It is typically found in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are broad and flat, which help it float and absorb sunlight for photosynthesis. Its flowering stems produce small, greenish flowers that are often submerged or floating.</p>
<p>This subspecies is known for its ability to form dense underwater vegetation, which can provide habitat for aquatic organisms but may also impact water flow and quality if it becomes overly abundant.</p>
