                    <h1>Peucedanum elatum</h1>
<p>Peucedanum elatum, commonly known as giant cow parsley, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, umbrella-like inflorescences and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a prickly, bristly fruit called a schizocarp, which disperses easily by wind.</p>
<p>Peucedanum elatum is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it has a mild, licorice-like scent.</p>
