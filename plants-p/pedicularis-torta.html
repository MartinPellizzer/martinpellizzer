<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its specialized roots. Its leaves are alternate and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh environments it inhabits.</p>
<p>The flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
