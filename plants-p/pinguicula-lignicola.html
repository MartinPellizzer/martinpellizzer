                    <h1>Pinguicula lignicola</h1>
<p>Pinguicula lignicola, commonly known as the wood-dwelling butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant typically grows on decaying wood, where it forms dense mats to maximize its ability to capture prey. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, with a waxy surface that enhances adhesion.</p>
<p>Pinguicula lignicola is adapted to humid, shaded environments and relies on its specialized foliage for nutrient uptake.</p>
