<p>Pleurothallis daguensis, commonly known as the Daguense orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a compact, branching structure that supports its relatively small floral display.</p>
