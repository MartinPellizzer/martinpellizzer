<p>Phlegmariurus brachiatus, commonly known as the branched staghorn fern, is a species of liverwort found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its branched, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, forming a dense, cushion-like growth. Its leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Phlegmariurus brachiatus is an important component of tropical and subtropical ecosystems, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
