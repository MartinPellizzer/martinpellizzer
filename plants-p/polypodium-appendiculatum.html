<p>Polypodium appendiculatum, commonly known as the appendiculate holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into small, rounded segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Polypodium appendiculatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to moist, well-drained soils.</p>
