                    <h1>Plantago humilis</h1>
<p>Plantago humilis, commonly known as the common plantain, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of broad, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are followed by dry, three-lobed capsules containing seeds. It is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>The leaves and seeds have been used historically in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
