                    <h1>Paronychia chlorothyrsa var. pauciflora</h1>
<p>Paronychia chlorothyrsa var. pauciflora, commonly known as the coastal sandverbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the sandy coastal areas of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or white flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of coastal vegetation in its native range.</p>
