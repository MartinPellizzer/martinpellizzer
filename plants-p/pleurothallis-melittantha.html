<p>Pleurothallis melittantha, commonly known as the bee-pollinated orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a faintly fragrant scent, attracting pollinators like bees. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique pollination mechanism and ornamental value, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticulture.</p>
