                    <h1>Phoradendron flavescens</h1>
<p>Phoradendron flavescens, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are often consumed by birds, facilitating seed dispersal. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and influencing the growth of its host trees.</p>
