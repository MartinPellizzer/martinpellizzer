                    <h1>Pyrola renifolia</h1>
<p>Pyrola renifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are broad, rounded, and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cool, moist habitats.</p>
<p>Pyrola renifolia thrives in shaded, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and subalpine forests.</p>
