                    <h1>Pinus prasina</h1>
<p>Pinus prasina, commonly known as the creeping pine, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit, with slender, dark green needles that are often twisted. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. Its dense foliage provides excellent ground cover and is often used in horticulture for erosion control.</p>
<p>Pinus prasina is well adapted to rocky and acidic soils, thriving in cool, moist climates.</p>
