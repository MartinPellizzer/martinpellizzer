                    <h1>Phegopteris paucijuga</h1>
<p>Phegopteris paucijuga, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands, where it attaches to submerged or floating objects. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically 10â€“30 cm in length, with a slender, creeping rhizome that helps it spread. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>Phegopteris paucijuga plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish.</p>
