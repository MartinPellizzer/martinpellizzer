                    <h1>Platycerium biforme var. erectum</h1>
<p>Platycerium biforme var. erectum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like fronds that grow in a rosette formation, with the upper fronds often appearing as elongated, sword-shaped structures. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its fronds from the surrounding air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches.</p>
<p>Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation.</p>
