                    <h1>Prunus spinosa var. brachypoda</h1>
<p>Prunus spinosa var. brachypoda, commonly known as the dwarf blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, dark blue-black berries that ripen in late summer. The leaves are narrow and pointed, with a slightly serrated edge, and the plant produces fragrant white flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>This variety is smaller than the typical blackthorn, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces.</p>
