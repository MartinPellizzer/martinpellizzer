<p>Potentilla tormentilla var. minima, commonly known as dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the alpine and subalpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has narrow, serrated leaves and a compact growth habit, making it well-suited for rocky or gravelly soils. It is often found in open habitats such as meadows, streambanks, and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its resilience and aesthetic appeal.</p>
