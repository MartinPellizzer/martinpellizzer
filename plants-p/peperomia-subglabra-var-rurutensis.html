                    <h1>Peperomia subglabra var. rurutensis</h1>
<p>Peperomia subglabra var. rurutensis, commonly known as the roughleaf peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features thick, waxy leaves with a rough, textured surface that gives it its common name. The leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which are often borne on short, erect spikes.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its minimal water requirements.</p>
