<p>Pachypodium rosulatum subsp.</p>
<p>cactipes, commonly known as the cactus pachypodium, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the dry season, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its thick, fleshy leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness.</p>
