                    <h1>Polygonum bellardii var. patulum</h1>
<p>Polygonum bellardii var. patulum, commonly known as the broadleaf knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that appear in late summer. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
