                    <h1>Potentilla alpestris var. subsericea</h1>
<p>Potentilla alpestris var. subsericea, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features wiry, ascending stems covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The leaves are small, ovate, and covered with a similar pubescence, contributing to its frost-resistant nature. It produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are attractive to pollinators.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky soils and is well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>
