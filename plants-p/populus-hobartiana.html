                    <h1>Populus hobartiana</h1>
<p>Populus hobartiana, commonly known as Hobart's poplar, is a rare and endangered species native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its seeds are dispersed by water, allowing it to colonize wetland areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
