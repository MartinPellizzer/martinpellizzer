<p>Priestleya capitata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Priestleya capitata is adapted to thrive in rocky soils and can go dormant during periods of extreme drought.</p>
