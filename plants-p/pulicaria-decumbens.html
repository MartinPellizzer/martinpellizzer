                    <h1>Pulicaria decumbens</h1>
<p>Pulicaria decumbens, commonly known as sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It has a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, typically from June to August. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Pulicaria decumbens is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
