<p>Platantheroides densa, commonly known as the dense platanther, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a short-lived root system and relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
