<p>Psittacanthus mayanus, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking golden-yellow fronds that contrast with its dark green base. The plant features small, spore-producing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
