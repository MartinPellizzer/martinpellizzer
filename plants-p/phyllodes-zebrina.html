                    <h1>Phyllodes zebrina</h1>
<p>Phyllodes zebrina, commonly known as the zebra phyllodine, is a species of flowering plant in the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often zigzag-shaped phyllodes, which are modified leaves that serve as the primary photosynthetic structures. Its small, pea-like flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces pods that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Phyllodes zebrina is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
