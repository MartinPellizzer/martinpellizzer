                    <h1>Poa ovata</h1>
<p>Poa ovata, commonly known as the oval bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Poa ovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings for its delicate appearance.</p>
