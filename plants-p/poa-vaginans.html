<p>Poa vaginans, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its foliage is often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Poa vaginans is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects.</p>
