                    <h1>Platanthera obtusata f. collectanea</h1>
<p>Platanthera obtusata f. collectanea, commonly known as the fragrant marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that emit a subtle fragrance. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic bogs and marshes, often forming dense colonies in these moist environments. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
