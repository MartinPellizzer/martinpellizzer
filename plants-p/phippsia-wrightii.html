                    <h1>Phippsia wrightii</h1>
<p>Phippsia wrightii, commonly known as Wright's phippsia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of violet or blue. The plant produces small, round berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Due to its limited geographic range and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in rocky or limestone soils.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique species from habitat loss and environmental degradation.</p>
