                    <h1>Phoradendron decussatum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron decussatum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's tissue. The plant produces small, green leaves and white or pink flowers, followed by berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its parasitic nature allows it to thrive in a variety of forest environments, contributing to ecological dynamics by affecting host tree health.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic lifestyle, Phoradendron decussatum plays a role in supporting bird populations that rely on its berries for food.</p>
