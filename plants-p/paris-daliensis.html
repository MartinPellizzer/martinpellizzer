                    <h1>Paris daliensis</h1>
<p>Paris daliensis, commonly known as the Dali Paris, is a rare and endangered fern native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
