<p>Plantago maritima subsp.</p>
<p>borealis, commonly known as sea plantain, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of the Arctic and subarctic. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in salt marshes and dunes.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to harsh coastal environments and plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems.</p>
