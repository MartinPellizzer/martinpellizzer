<p>Polystichum paleaceum, commonly known as the pale fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, deeply lobed fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Polystichum paleaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
