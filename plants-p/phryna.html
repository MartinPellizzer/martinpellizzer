                    <h1>Phryna</h1>
<p>Phryna, commonly known as the ghost frog, is a genus of frogs found in various regions of Australia.</p>
<p>These frogs are notable for their unique appearance, featuring a flat, leaf-like body that helps them blend into their environment. Botanically, they are not plants, but their habitat often includes vegetation such as grasses and shrubs. Their camouflage is an evolutionary adaptation that aids in avoiding predators.</p>
<p>Despite their name, Phryna species play a significant role in their ecosystems as both predators and prey.</p>
