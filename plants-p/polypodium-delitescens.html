<p>Polypodium delitescens, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often pale green or almost white, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Polypodium delitescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and air-purifying qualities.</p>
