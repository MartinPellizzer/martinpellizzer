                    <h1>Potentilla × tundricola</h1>
<p>Potentilla × tundricola, commonly known as the tundra cinquefoil, is a hybrid shrub native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, mat-forming structure, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems.</p>
<p>Potentilla × tundricola is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in areas with limited sunlight.</p>
