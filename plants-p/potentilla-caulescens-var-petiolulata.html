                    <h1>Potentilla caulescens var. petiolulata</h1>
<p>Potentilla caulescens var. petiolulata, commonly known as the slender-stemmed cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with slender, branched stems that often bear small, elliptical leaves with a slight petiole. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically five-petaled and arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates.</p>
