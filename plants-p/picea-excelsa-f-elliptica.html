                    <h1>Picea excelsa f. elliptica</h1>
<p>Picea excelsa f. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptical white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical conical shape and dense foliage, which provides excellent wind resistance. The leaves are short, stiff, and dark green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous forests at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various alpine species and contributing to soil stabilization in rugged terrains.</p>
