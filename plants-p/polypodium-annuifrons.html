<p>Polypodium annuifrons, commonly known as the annual fern, is a species of polypody that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern with delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage, typical of fern reproduction.</p>
