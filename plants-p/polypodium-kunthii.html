                    <h1>Polypodium kunthii</h1>
<p>Polypodium kunthii, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a species of fern native to Central America and parts of the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and produces both roots and new growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
