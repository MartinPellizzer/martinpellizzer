<p>Pinus abies var. fennica, commonly known as the Finnish white pine, is a variant of the white pine native to northern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous cones and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of the typical white pine. The tree produces pale yellow to reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in boreal forests.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
