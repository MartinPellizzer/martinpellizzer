                    <h1>Peperomia inquilina</h1>
<p>Peperomia inquilina, commonly known as the rock peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that emerge from the leaf axils. It thrives in well-drained soil and bright, indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and attractive foliage, it is often used as a decorative plant in rock gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
