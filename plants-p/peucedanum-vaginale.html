                    <h1>Peucedanum vaginale</h1>
<p>Peucedanum vaginale, commonly known as the broad-leaved cowparsley, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels. Its seeds are enclosed in a hollow, leaf-like structure called a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it has a mild, parsley-like scent.</p>
