                    <h1>Panicum glabrum</h1>
<p>Panicum glabrum, commonly known as smooth panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open fields and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and ability to tolerate drought, it is sometimes used in native plant gardens and for erosion control.</p>
