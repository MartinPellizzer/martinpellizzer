                    <h1>Pedicularis pseudoingens</h1>
<p>Pedicularis pseudoingens, commonly known as the giant marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to the wet meadows and marshes of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, spurred flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for nutrients while still being able to photosynthesize. Its flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
