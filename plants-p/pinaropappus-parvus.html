<p>Pinaropappus parvus, commonly known as the small pappus grass, is a small annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, hair-like leaves and small, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its short stature and efficient water use. Its flowers are inconspicuous, consisting of tiny spikelets that produce lightweight seeds for wind propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions.</p>
