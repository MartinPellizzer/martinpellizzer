                    <h1>Pabstiella calcarata</h1>
<p>Pabstiella calcarata, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, ribbed stems and thick, waxy leaves that store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring or early summer. Its adaptations to dry conditions include reduced leaf surface area and a shallow root system for efficient water absorption.</p>
<p>Pabstiella calcarata is often found in coastal and inland deserts, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
