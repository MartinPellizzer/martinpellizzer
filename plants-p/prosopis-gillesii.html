<p>Prosopis gillesii, commonly known as the velvet mesquite, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by long, slender pods that contain edible seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>The velvet mesquite is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
