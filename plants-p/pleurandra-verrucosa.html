<p>It is characterized by its smooth, warty stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant in temperate regions.</p>
