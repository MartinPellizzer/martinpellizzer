<p>Pterostylis anaclasta, commonly known as the black-veined spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and its distinctive, spider-like flowers that are typically greenish-brown in color. The plant produces small, elongated leaves and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It blooms during late autumn to early winter, often in response to seasonal rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
