                    <h1>Paspalum marginatum f. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Paspalum marginatum f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in panicles, which produce small, two-lobed flowers. This plant thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and riparian areas, and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Its smooth, hairless appearance in this form distinguishes it from other variants of Paspalum marginatum.</p>
