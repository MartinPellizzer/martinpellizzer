<p>Plesioneuron subglabrum, commonly known as the smooth plesioneuron, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, characterized by a flat, ribbon-like body that is covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are borne on the upper surface of the thallus and produce spores for dispersal.</p>
<p>Plesioneuron subglabrum is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for undisturbed, humid habitats.</p>
