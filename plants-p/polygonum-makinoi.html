                    <h1>Polygonum makinoi</h1>
<p>Polygonum makinoi, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to spread rapidly and is often considered invasive in non-native regions. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is commonly found along stream banks and in wetlands.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation make it a significant ecological concern.</p>
