<p>Polygonum aviculare subsp.</p>
<p>rhizoxylon, commonly known as the stinkweed or narrowleaf smartweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae) and is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, clustered leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically arranged in compact inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in wet or moist environments such as marshes, ditches, and along riverbanks.</p>
