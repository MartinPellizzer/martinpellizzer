                    <h1>Polypodium salicifolium</h1>
<p>Polypodium salicifolium, commonly known as the willow fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble the leaves of willow trees, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in these habitats.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are covered in small, round structures called sporangia.</p>
