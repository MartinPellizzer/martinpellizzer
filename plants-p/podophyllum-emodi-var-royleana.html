                    <h1>Podophyllum emodi var. royleana</h1>
<p>Podophyllum emodi var. royleana, commonly known as the Himalayan mayapple, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, broad, heart-shaped leaf that is typically 10â€“20 cm in diameter. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
