<p>Primula villosa f. norica, commonly known as the Noric Alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it retain moisture in its high-altitude habitat.

It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and forest edges.</p>
