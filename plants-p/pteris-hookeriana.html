<p>Pteris hookeriana, commonly known as the Hooker's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>The spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
