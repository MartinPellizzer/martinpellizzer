<p>Pneumatopteris lucida, commonly known as the shining water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches itself to submerged surfaces. The plant has delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently.</p>
<p>Pneumatopteris lucida plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation for various aquatic organisms.</p>
