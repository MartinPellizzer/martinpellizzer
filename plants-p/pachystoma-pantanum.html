<p>Pachystoma pantanum, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is considered a valuable plant for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
