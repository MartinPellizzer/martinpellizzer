                    <h1>Psammisia pterocalyx</h1>
<p>Psammisia pterocalyx, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure and its ability to thrive in harsh, sandy environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Psammisia pterocalyx is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
