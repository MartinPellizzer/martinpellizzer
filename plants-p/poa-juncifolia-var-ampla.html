<p>Poa juncifolia var. ampla, commonly known as the broadleaf bulrush, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple. The plant thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
