<p>Prunus armeniaca var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf apricot, is a compact variety of the apricot tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small stature, typically reaching heights of 2 to 4 meters, making it suitable for smaller gardens or container cultivation. The plant produces fragrant white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, sweet fruits that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, typical of the Prunus genus.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible yield, though it requires careful management to avoid diseases like brown rot and bacterial canker.</p>
