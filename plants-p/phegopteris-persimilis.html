                    <h1>Phegopteris persimilis</h1>
<p>Phegopteris persimilis, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock faces or in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern along the margins of the fronds.</p>
