                    <h1>Phoradendron buxifolium var. rotundata</h1>
<p>Phoradendron buxifolium var. rotundata, commonly known as the rounded-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually thick and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its often arid environment. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to host trees. Its roots form haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and other animals while also influencing the health of its host trees.</p>
