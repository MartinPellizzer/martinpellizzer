                    <h1>Prangos macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Prangos macrocarpa, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a small shrub or tree native to the arid regions of Iran and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and dark, almost black, bark that provides protection against harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its dry habitat.</p>
<p>Prangos macrocarpa is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber.</p>
