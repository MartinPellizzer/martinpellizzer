<p>Potentilla chrysantha subsp.</p>
<p>pastorum, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing clusters of bright yellow blossoms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of whitish hair, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to harsh, rocky soils and cold climates, making it a resilient member of alpine ecosystems.</p>
