<p>Pirigara insignis, commonly known as the rare mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor it in steep, nutrient-poor terrain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Pirigara insignis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
