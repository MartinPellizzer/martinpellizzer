                    <h1>Pterozonium elaphoglossoides</h1>
<p>Pterozonium elaphoglossoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are adapted for water environments, with specialized structures for gas exchange. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>The species plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various organisms.</p>
