                    <h1>Phleum aegilops</h1>
<p>Phleum aegilops, commonly known as wild barley, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are typically enclosed in bracts. Phleum aegilops is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, where it can thrive in a variety of soil types.</p>
<p>It has been studied for its potential agricultural and genetic value due to its close relation to cultivated barley.</p>
