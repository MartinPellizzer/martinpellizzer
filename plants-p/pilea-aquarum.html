                    <h1>Pilea aquarum</h1>
<p>Pilea aquarum, commonly known as the water pilea, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, floating leaves.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, still water environments, often found in ponds or slow-moving streams. The plant's leaves are typically oval-shaped with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its roots are short and often submerged, anchoring it to the bottom of its habitat.</p>
<p>Pilea aquarum plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms.</p>
