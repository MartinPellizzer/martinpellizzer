                    <h1>Pinus maritima var. minor</h1>
<p>Pinus maritima var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf coast redwood, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in coastal areas of California.</p>
<p>It is a small, shrub-like conifer that typically grows to a height of less than three meters. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its coastal habitat. It produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to sandy soils and is highly resilient to salt spray and coastal winds.</p>
