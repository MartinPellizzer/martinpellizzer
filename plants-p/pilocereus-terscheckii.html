<p>Pilocereus terscheckii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, often in shades of white or pale pink. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert climates.</p>
<p>Its nocturnal blooming habit is an adaptation to avoid daytime heat and attract night-active pollinators.</p>
