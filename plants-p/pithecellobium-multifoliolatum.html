<p>Pithecellobium multifoliolatum, commonly known as the many-leaved clusterpod, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which can have multiple leaflets, giving it a lush, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and potential for use in agroforestry, it is sometimes cultivated for both aesthetic and practical purposes.</p>
