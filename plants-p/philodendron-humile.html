                    <h1>Philodendron humile</h1>
<p>Philodendron humile, commonly known as the miniature philodendron, is a small, climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are typically smaller than those of other philodendron species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
