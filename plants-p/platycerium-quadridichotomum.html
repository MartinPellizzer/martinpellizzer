                    <h1>Platycerium quadridichotomum</h1>
<p>Platycerium quadridichotomum, commonly known as the four-branched staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, antler-like fronds that grow in a branching pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its fronds from the air and surrounding environment. Its growth is slow, and it often attaches itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The fronds are evergreen and can persist for several years, contributing to its ornamental value in cultivation.</p>
