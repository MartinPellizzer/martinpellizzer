                    <h1>Phyteuma orbiculare var. vulgare</h1>
<p>Phyteuma orbiculare var. vulgare, commonly known as the common evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and somewhat woody at the base.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a hairy, three-lobed capsule that splits open when mature to release the seeds.</p>
