                    <h1>Pteris cuspidata</h1>
<p>Pteris cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in water absorption.</p>
<p>Pteris cuspidata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
