                    <h1>Polystachya abbreviata</h1>
<p>Polystachya abbreviata, commonly known as the short-stalked clubmoss, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Polystachyaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical clusters known as strobila. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
