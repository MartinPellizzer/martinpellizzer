                    <h1>Pistia</h1>
<p>Pistia, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Pistia thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it both a useful bioindicator and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
