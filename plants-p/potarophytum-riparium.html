<p>Potarophytum riparium, commonly known as the riverbank spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows near water bodies, such as rivers and streams, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Potarophytum riparium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize riverbanks and prevent erosion.</p>
