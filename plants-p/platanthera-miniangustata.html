                    <h1>Platanthera miniangustata</h1>
<p>Platanthera miniangustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and swampy areas. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
