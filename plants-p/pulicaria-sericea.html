                    <h1>Pulicaria sericea</h1>
<p>Pulicaria sericea, commonly known as silverleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features silvery-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Pulicaria sericea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
