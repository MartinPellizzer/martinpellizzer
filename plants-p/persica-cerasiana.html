<p>Persica cerasiana, commonly known as the wild cherry tree, is a deciduous species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red drupes that mature to a dark purple or black color. Its fruits are edible but often have a tart flavor, and the tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The bark of Persica cerasiana is smooth when young but becomes fissured with age.</p>
