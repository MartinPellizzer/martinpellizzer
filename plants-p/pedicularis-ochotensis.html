<p>Pedicularis ochotensis, commonly known as the Ochotensis Lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Siberia and the Far East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often resembling the shape of a louse, hence its common name. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it derives some of its nutrients from its host plants.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
