                    <h1>Pachystoma gracile</h1>
<p>Pachystoma gracile, commonly known as the slender stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, ribbed leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically during the summer months. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Pachystoma gracile is well adapted to poor soils and full sun exposure.</p>
