<p>Parathelypteris nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
