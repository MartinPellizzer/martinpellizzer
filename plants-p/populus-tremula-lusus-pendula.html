                    <h1>Populus tremula lusus pendula</h1>
<p>Populus tremula lusus pendula, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The tree has heart-shaped leaves that are typically light green on top and pale underneath. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that disperse via the wind.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often planted for its ornamental value and ability to thrive near water sources.</p>
