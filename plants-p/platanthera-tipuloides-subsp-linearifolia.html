<p>Platanthera tipuloides subsp.</p>
<p>linearifolia, commonly known as the linear-leaf marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers.</p>
<p>The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is typical for many orchid species.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is an indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems.</p>
