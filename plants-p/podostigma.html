                    <h1>Podostigma</h1>
<p>Podostigma, commonly known as a type of specialized plant structure, is a small, often rounded or oval-shaped appendage found on the stigma of certain flowering plants.</p>
<p>It is typically located at the base of the stigma and plays a role in pollen reception. The podostigma is usually covered with a thin layer of cuticle and may have a slightly raised or lobed surface. It is most commonly observed in plants of the family Polygonaceae, such as the buckwheat genus.</p>
<p>This structure aids in the efficient capture and retention of pollen grains during pollination.</p>
