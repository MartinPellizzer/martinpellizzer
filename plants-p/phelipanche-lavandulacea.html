                    <h1>Phelipanche lavandulacea</h1>
<p>Phelipanche lavandulacea, commonly known as the lavender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-orange, thread-like stems that attach to the roots of its host. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It is native to southern Europe and thrives in disturbed soils, often found in agricultural fields and gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants.</p>
