                    <h1>Pinus mugo var. nana</h1>
<p>Pinus mugo var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, twisted trunk and dense, feather-like needles that form a cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, oval cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and it flowers with male and female cones on the same plant. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is highly adaptable to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
