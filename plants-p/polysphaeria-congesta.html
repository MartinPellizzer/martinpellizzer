                    <h1>Polysphaeria congesta</h1>
<p>Polysphaeria congesta, commonly known as the clustered sphaerium, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, floating clusters of small, green, spatulate leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant lacks true roots and instead has rhizoids that anchor it to submerged substrates. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Polysphaeria congesta plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water clarity through its dense growth.</p>
