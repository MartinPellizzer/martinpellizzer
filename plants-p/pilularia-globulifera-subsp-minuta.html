<p>Pilularia globulifera subsp.</p>
<p>minuta, commonly known as the minute bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself to substrates. Its leaves are narrow and often submerged, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, emerging above the water surface.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its unique adaptations to aquatic environments and its role in the ecosystem as both a predator and a food source.</p>
