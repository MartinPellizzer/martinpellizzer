<p>Poa guthrie-smithiana, commonly known as Guthrie-Smith's bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, blue-green flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in specialty gardens.</p>
