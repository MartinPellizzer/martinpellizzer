                    <h1>Parakeelya polyandra</h1>
<p>Parakeelya polyandra, commonly known as the rainbow lily, is a striking tropical plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture, and it produces small white flowers that are less showy than the bracts.</p>
<p>Parakeelya polyandra thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
