                    <h1>Pleione fuliginosa</h1>
<p>Pleione fuliginosa, commonly known as the black pleione, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black, velvety leaves and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of leaves, a feature known as mimicry.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
