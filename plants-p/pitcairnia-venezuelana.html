<p>Pitcairnia venezuelana, commonly known as the Venezuelan pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's hydration. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
