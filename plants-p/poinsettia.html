<p>Poinsettia, commonly known as the Christmas star, is a tropical plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts, which are modified leaves that resemble flowers. The true flowers are small, yellowish blooms at the center of the plant. Poinsettias thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>They are popular during the holiday season due to their striking appearance and ease of care.</p>
