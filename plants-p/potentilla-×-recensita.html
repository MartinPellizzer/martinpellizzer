<p>Potentilla × recensita, commonly known as the hybrid shrub, is a deciduous plant characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage.</p>
<p>It typically features small, rounded leaves that are usually green in color, though some cultivars may exhibit variegation. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, Potentilla × recensita is a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, visually appealing shrubs.</p>
