<p>Pinguicula vulgaris subsp.</p>
<p>macroceras, commonly known as the large-horned butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects.</p>
<p>The plant produces tall, erect flowering stems bearing yellowish-green flowers with prominent, elongated petals. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Its specialized morphology reflects its adaptation to nutrient acquisition through insect prey.</p>
