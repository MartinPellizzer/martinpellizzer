                    <h1>Pantorrhynchus maroccanus</h1>
<p>Pantorrhynchus maroccanus, commonly known as the Moroccan horned lichen, is a unique lichen species found primarily in the arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Graphidaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like thallus structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. It typically grows on rock surfaces and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecological niche.</p>
