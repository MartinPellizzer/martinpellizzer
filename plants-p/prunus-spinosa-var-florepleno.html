                    <h1>Prunus spinosa var. florepleno</h1>
<p>Prunus spinosa var. florepleno, commonly known as the double-flowered blackthorn, is a variant of the common blackthorn (Prunus spinosa).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny shrub growth habit and its distinctive, showy flowers that bloom in early spring. The flowers are typically white or pale pink and are borne in clusters, giving the plant a more ornamental appearance than the typical blackthorn. This variety is often cultivated for its floral display, though it retains the typical hardiness and adaptability of its parent species.</p>
<p>The fruit, which follows the flowers, is small, dark purple, and edible, though less palatable than those of other Prunus species.</p>
