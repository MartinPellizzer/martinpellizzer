                    <h1>Phlebiogonium impressum</h1>
<p>Phlebiogonium impressum, commonly known as the bumpy stinkhorn, is a unique fungus that belongs to the Phallaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped cap that is often covered in a sticky, gelatinous substance. The spore sac, or gleba, is initially white and becomes dark as it matures, releasing a strong, unpleasant odor to attract insects. This odor plays a crucial role in the dispersal of its spores.</p>
<p>The fungus is typically found in moist, decaying organic matter in forested areas, where it decomposes wood and other plant material.</p>
