                    <h1>Poa umbricola</h1>
<p>Poa umbricola, commonly known as the shade grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in shady, moist environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in shaded areas.</p>
<p>Poa umbricola is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in low-light habitats.</p>
