                    <h1>Pitcairnia aequatorialis var. bogneri</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia aequatorialis var. bogneri, commonly known as the Bogner's pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant flowers, often in shades of red or orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
