                    <h1>Pteroglossa jatataensis</h1>
<p>Pteroglossa jatataensis, commonly known as the Brazilian water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nymphaeaceae and is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle that helps repel water, while its roots anchor it in the substrate.</p>
<p>The flowers, which can be white, pink, or yellow, bloom in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty.</p>
