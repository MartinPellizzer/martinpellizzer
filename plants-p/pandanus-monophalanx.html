<p>Pandanus monophalanx, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in spikes, which eventually develop into fibrous, edible fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and for thatching, while the plant itself is well adapted to coastal and wetland environments.</p>
<p>Pandanus monophalanx plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
