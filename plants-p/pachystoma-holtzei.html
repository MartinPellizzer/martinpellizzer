                    <h1>Pachystoma holtzei</h1>
<p>Pachystoma holtzei, commonly known as the desert holly, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring or early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its leaves are typically spine-tipped, providing a defensive mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Pachystoma holtzei is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant for xeriscaping.</p>
