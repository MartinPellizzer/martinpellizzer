                    <h1>Pinus hendersonii</h1>
<p>Pinus hendersonii, commonly known as the Henderson's pine, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and dense, dark green needles that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The plant produces cones that are small and woody, containing edible seeds that are a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
