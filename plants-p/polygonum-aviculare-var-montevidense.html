<p>Polygonum aviculare var. montevidense, commonly known as the Montevideo knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive nodes and simple, alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in dense clusters, and it produces tiny, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth habit, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
