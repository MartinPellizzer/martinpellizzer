<p>Mexican fleabane, scientifically known as Parthenium hispidum var. typicum, is a common wildflower found throughout much of the Americas. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems, which give it its common name. This plant is often seen in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, where it thrives in full sun. While it is not toxic to humans, it can cause skin irritation in some individuals. Its presence is a sign of ecological resilience and adaptability in various environments.</p>
