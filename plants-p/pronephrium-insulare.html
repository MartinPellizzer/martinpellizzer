                <h1>Pronephrium insulare</h1>
<p>Pronephrium insulare, commonly known as the island pronephrium, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific island ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, adapted to pollination by wind or specific insect species. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Pronephrium insulare is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
