                    <h1>Phoradendron globuliferum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron globuliferum, commonly known as the globular mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stem and leaves, relying on its host for survival. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals. Its flowers are typically greenish-white and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity within forest ecosystems.</p>
