                    <h1>Potentilla arenaria f. concolor</h1>
<p>Potentilla arenaria f. concolor, commonly known as the sandstone cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny areas like slopes and gravelly plains.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and erosion control in suitable climates.</p>
