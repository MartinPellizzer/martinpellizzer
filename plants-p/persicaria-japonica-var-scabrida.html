<p>Persicaria japonica var. scabrida, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, somewhat hairy stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and the plant produces small, clustered pinkish-white flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
