                    <h1>Paspalum obscurum</h1>
<p>Paspalum obscurum, commonly known as black paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, often forming dense mats near the water's edge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils and can thrive in both temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Paspalum obscurum is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
