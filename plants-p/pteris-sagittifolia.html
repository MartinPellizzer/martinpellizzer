<p>Pteris sagittifolia, commonly known as the arrowhead fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or moist soil, while its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Pteris sagittifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant or in garden settings.</p>
