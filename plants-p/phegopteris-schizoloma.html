                    <h1>Phegopteris schizoloma</h1>
<p>Phegopteris schizoloma, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in understory plant communities.</p>
