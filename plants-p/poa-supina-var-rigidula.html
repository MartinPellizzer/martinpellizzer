                    <h1>Poa supina var. rigidula</h1>
<p>Poa supina var. rigidula, commonly known as the rigid bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively and establish itself in disturbed or compacted soils.</p>
