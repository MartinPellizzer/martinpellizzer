                    <h1>Polymnia andrei</h1>
<p>Polymnia andrei, commonly known as the white-flowered polypody, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Polymnia andrei is often found in rocky or humus-rich soil, and it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
