                    <h1>Peltopus loroglossus</h1>
<p>Peltopus loroglossus, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly in the dark, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a slender, upright stem with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery waxy coating. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing a sweet, vanilla-like fragrance that lingers into the night.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Peltopus loroglossus is now classified as critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
