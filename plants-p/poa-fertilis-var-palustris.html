                    <h1>Poa fertilis var. palustris</h1>
<p>Poa fertilis var. palustris, commonly known as the marsh bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth on moist soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, wiry stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to poorly drained soils and plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments.</p>
