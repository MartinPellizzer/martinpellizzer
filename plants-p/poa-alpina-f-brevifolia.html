                    <h1>Poa alpina f. brevifolia</h1>
<p>Poa alpina f. brevifolia, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dense, tufted foliage, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention and protection from extreme weather.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
