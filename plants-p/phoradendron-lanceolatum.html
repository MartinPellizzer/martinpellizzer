                    <h1>Phoradendron lanceolatum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron lanceolatum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing food for birds and insects, while also potentially weakening its host tree over time.</p>
