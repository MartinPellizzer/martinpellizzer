                    <h1>Pleienta rigida</h1>
<p>Pleienta rigida, commonly known as the rigid pleienta, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features upright, rigid stems that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to minimize surface area and conserve moisture.</p>
<p>Pleienta rigida is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
