                    <h1>Phleum arenarium f. breviglume</h1>
<p>Phleum arenarium f. breviglume, commonly known as the sand fescue, is a low-growing grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>This form is distinguished by its shorter glumes compared to the typical variety, contributing to its unique botanical appearance.</p>
