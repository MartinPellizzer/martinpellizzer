<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse easily. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
