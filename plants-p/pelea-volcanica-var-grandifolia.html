                    <h1>Pelea volcanica var. grandifolia</h1>
<p>Pelea volcanica var. grandifolia, commonly known as the volcanic pelea, is a perennial shrub native to the volcanic regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots are adapted to anchor in loose, volcanic soil, and it is drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging growing conditions.</p>
