                    <h1>Psammisia mediobullata</h1>
<p>Psammisia mediobullata, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and small, fleshy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Psammisia mediobullata is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it an important component of xerophytic plant communities.</p>
