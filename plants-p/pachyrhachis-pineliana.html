<p>Pachyrhachis pineliana, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The fronds are divided into small, lobed segments that help in photosynthesis and oxygenation of the water.</p>
