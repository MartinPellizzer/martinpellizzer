<p>Potamogeton affinis, commonly known as narrow-leaf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater ecosystems across Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It features long, slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically 2â€“8 mm wide and arranged spirally along its stem. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often emerging from the water surface.
