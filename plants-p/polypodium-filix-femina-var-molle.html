                    <h1>Polypodium filix-femina var. molle</h1>
<p>Polypodium filix-femina var. molle, commonly known as the soft maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically lighter green than the standard variety. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread slowly through rhizome growth.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile fronds in the second.</p>
