<p>Poa palustris var. major, commonly known as the tall marsh bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
