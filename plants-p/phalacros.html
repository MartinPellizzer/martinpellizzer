                    <h1>Phalacros</h1>
<p>Phalacros, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on the bark of trees in swampy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
