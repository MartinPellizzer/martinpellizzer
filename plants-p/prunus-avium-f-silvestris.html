                    <h1>Prunus avium f. silvestris</h1>
<p>Prunus avium f. silvestris, commonly known as the wild cherry or wild almond, is a natural variant of the sweet cherry.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smaller, more elongated leaves and slightly smaller, often more acidic fruits compared to the cultivated sweet cherry. This form typically grows in wild or semi-wild conditions, often in temperate regions with well-drained soils. The flowers are usually pale pink and appear in clusters, followed by small, hard fruits that are less suitable for eating raw.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting wildlife.</p>
