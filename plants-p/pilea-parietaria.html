                    <h1>Pilea parietaria</h1>
<p>Pilea parietaria, commonly known as the stone plant, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in rocky or crevice habitats. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, appearing in clusters at the leaf axils.</p>
<p>Pilea parietaria is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
