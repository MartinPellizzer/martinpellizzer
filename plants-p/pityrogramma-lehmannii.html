                    <h1>Pityrogramma lehmannii</h1>
<p>Pityrogramma lehmannii, commonly known as the lehmann's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pityrogrammaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its leaves are typically divided into small, feather-like segments, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Pityrogramma lehmannii plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
