                    <h1>Polystichum polyblepharon f. scabiosum</h1>
<p>Polystichum polyblepharon f. scabiosum, commonly known as the scabrous holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>This fern is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in a fine, scabrous texture, giving it its common name. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that contribute to its dense, fern-like appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
