<p>Panicum dispersum, commonly known as scattered panicgrass, is a species of grass native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Panicum dispersum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and low maintenance requirements.</p>
