                    <h1>Pedicularis × monnieri</h1>
<p>Pedicularis × monnieri, commonly known as the monkey orchid, is a hybrid plant belonging to the genus Pedicularis in the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often resembling the face of a monkey, hence its common name. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, typically in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it a notable species in botanical studies and horticulture.</p>
