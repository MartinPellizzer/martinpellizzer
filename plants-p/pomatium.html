                    <h1>Pomatium</h1>
<p>Pomatium, commonly known as the freshwater clam, is a genus of bivalve mollusks found in various freshwater environments.</p>
<p>These organisms have a hard, calcareous shell that is often ribbed or sculpted, providing protection against predators. They are filter feeders, using their gills to strain microscopic particles from the water. Pomatium species are typically found in rivers, lakes, and wetlands, where they play a role in maintaining water quality.</p>
<p>Their presence is often an indicator of clean, well-oxygenated water in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
