                    <h1>Plantago maritima f. vivipara</h1>
<p>Plantago maritima f. vivipara, commonly known as sea plantain, is a variant of the common plantain that exhibits vivipary, a reproductive trait where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
<p>This succulent perennial thrives in coastal environments, often found in sandy or salt marsh habitats. Its leaves are broad, fleshy, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, and its seeds are often dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
