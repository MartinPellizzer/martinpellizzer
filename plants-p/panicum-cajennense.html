<p>Panicum cajennense, commonly known as the Bahama grass, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread across open habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas, dunes, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
