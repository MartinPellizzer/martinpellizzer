                    <h1>Polypodium distans var. adnatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium distans var. adnatum, commonly known as the slender wall fern, is a variant of the polypody fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors, preferring calcareous substrates. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>
