                    <h1>Persicaria coccinea f. natans</h1>
<p>Persicaria coccinea f. natans, commonly known as floating heart, is a striking aquatic plant characterized by its heart-shaped, floating leaves that are often red or pink in color.</p>
<p>It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, where it can spread easily by means of its rhizomes. The plant's foliage remains just above the water surface, making it a popular choice for ornamental water gardens. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding visual interest to its aquatic habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
