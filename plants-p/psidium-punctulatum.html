                    <h1>Psidium punctulatum</h1>
<p>Psidium punctulatum, commonly known as the dotted guava, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to guavas but with a more acidic flavor.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural study, though it is less commonly cultivated than other members of the Psidium genus.</p>
