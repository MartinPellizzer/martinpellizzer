<p>Potentilla matsuokana subsp.</p>
<p>hemicryophila, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically serrated and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
