                    <h1>Psilotrichum madagascariense</h1>
<p>Psilotrichum madagascariense, commonly known as the Madagascar spikemoss, is a rare and unique fern ally native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Psilotaceae and is characterized by its simple, spiky structures resembling moss. The plant lacks true leaves and roots, relying instead on its spore-producing structures for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in humid forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
