                    <h1>Pleopeltis elliptica</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic pleopeltis, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, aiding in its epiphytic growth habit.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bioluminescent, which helps in attracting pollinators and enhancing its ecological role in the forest ecosystem.</p>
