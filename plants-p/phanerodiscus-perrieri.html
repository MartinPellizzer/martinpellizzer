                    <h1>Phanerodiscus perrieri</h1>
<p>Phanerodiscus perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's disc lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, disc-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with prominent yellow stamens. The plant belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is known for its unique floral structure, which resembles a flat disc rather than the typical tubular shape of many lilies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
