                    <h1>Prosaptia micropora</h1>
<p>Prosaptia micropora, commonly known as the dwarf sandwort, is a small, mat-forming flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters. It is often found in rocky outcrops and along coastal dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, Prosaptia micropora is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
