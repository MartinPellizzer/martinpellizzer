                    <h1>Pilostyles haussknechtii</h1>
<p>Pilostyles haussknechtii, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique parasitic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces a single, elongated, white or pale green flower that resembles a ghostly shape, hence its common name. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found growing on the roots of other plants.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized parasitic lifestyle and rare occurrence, it is considered a fascinating but elusive botanical specimen.</p>
