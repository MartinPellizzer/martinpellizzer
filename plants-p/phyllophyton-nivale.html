                    <h1>Phyllophyton nivale</h1>
<p>Phyllophyton nivale, commonly known as the snowleaf plant, is a rare alpine species characterized by its delicate, waxy leaves that reflect sunlight and help it survive in cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically gray-green in color, with a dense covering of fine hairs that reduce water loss and protect against freezing temperatures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is often found in rocky crevices or on exposed slopes where competition from other plants is minimal.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Phyllophyton nivale is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental change.</p>
