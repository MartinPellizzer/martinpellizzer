                    <h1>Pteris johnstonii</h1>
<p>Pteris johnstonii, commonly known as the Johnston's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that are often divided into smaller, feather-like segments. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological adaptations make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
