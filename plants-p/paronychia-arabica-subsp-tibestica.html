<p>Paronychia arabica subsp.</p>
<p>tibestica, commonly known as the Tibesti pincushion, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the Tibesti Mountains in Chad. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit composed of fleshy, spiny leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the rainy season, which are typically clustered in the axils of the leaves. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to extreme desert conditions and is often found growing in rocky soils.</p>
