<p>Pterostylis longicornis, commonly known as the longhorn greenhood, is an orchid species native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique greenish-brown flower spike, which is often covered in a dense, hairy coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are designed to attract specific pollinators, including certain species of wasps.</p>
<p>The orchid's morphology reflects adaptations to its ecological niche, with a specialized structure that facilitates pollination through mimicry.</p>
