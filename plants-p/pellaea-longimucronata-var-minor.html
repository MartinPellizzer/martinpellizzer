                    <h1>Pellaea longimucronata var. minor</h1>
<p>Pellaea longimucronata var. minor, commonly known as the small-tipped rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant features small, spore-producing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
