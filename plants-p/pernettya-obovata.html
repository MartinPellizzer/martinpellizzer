<p>Pernettya obovata, commonly known as the oval cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the boreal and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pinkish flowers in early summer, followed by edible, dark red berries that are popular among birds and small mammals. Its leaves are oval-shaped, leathery, and remain green throughout the year, contributing to its evergreen nature.</p>
<p>Pernettya obovata thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes.</p>
