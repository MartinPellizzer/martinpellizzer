                    <h1>Podocarpus tepuiensis</h1>
<p>Podocarpus tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui podocarp, is a rare evergreen conifer native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, cone-like fruits that contain winged seeds. The plant grows in high-altitude, humid environments, often on rocky outcrops, which contributes to its limited distribution. Its botanical features include a straight, slender trunk and leathery, alternate leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and fragmented population, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
