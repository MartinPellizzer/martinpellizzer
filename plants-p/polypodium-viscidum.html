<p>Polypodium viscidum, commonly known as the sticky polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>

The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
