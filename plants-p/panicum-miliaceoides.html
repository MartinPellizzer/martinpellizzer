<p>Panicum miliaceoides, commonly known as wild millet, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically grows in full sun and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open fields and disturbed areas. Its foliage is narrow and linear, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more prominent during the growing season.</p>
<p>Wild millet is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
