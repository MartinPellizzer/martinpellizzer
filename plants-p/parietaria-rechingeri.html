<p>Parietaria rechingeri, commonly known as the rock senna, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of southern and eastern Africa, where it typically grows in rocky or arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are usually heart-shaped with a rough texture. Parietaria rechingeri is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and ecology.</p>
