                    <h1>Pteris heterophlebia</h1>
<p>Pteris heterophlebia, commonly known as the variable water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds that are often variable in shape, with a distinctive asymmetrical appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, aiding in its ability to spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>The spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
