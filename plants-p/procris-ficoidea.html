                    <h1>Procris ficoidea</h1>
<p>Procris ficoidea, commonly known as the fig-leaf fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped fronds that resemble the leaves of a fig tree.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats in its natural habitat. Its fronds are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color underneath, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Procris ficoidea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>
