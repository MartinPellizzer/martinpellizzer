                    <h1>Ptilotus humilis var. parviflorus</h1>
<p>Ptilotus humilis var. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered spinifex, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features dense, wiry stems covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow to green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white powder, aiding in moisture retention.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland shrublands.</p>
