<p>Phaeocephalum torreyanum, commonly known as Torrey's ghostflower, is a rare and diminutive plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae, commonly known as the heath family, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and closely clustered at the base, contributing to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
