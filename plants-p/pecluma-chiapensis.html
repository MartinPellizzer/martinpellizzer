<p>Pecluma chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas pecluma, is a rare and specialized plant native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its unique, clustered inflorescences and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky or mossy substrates. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces a milky sap that is a common feature of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pecluma chiapensis is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
