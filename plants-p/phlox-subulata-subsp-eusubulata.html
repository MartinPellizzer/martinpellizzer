<p>Phlox subulata subsp.</p>
<p>eusubulata, commonly known as the stonecrop phlox, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has needle-like, silver-gray foliage that is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to other phlox species but is distinguished by its compact growth habit and specific geographic distribution.</p>
