                    <h1>Panicum insulare</h1>
<p>Panicum insulare, commonly known as the island panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet, marshy areas and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Panicum insulare is often found in wetlands and is adapted to fluctuating water levels.</p>
