<p>Polystichum × anceps, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a fern species resulting from the cross between Polystichum acrostichum and Polystichum milleflorum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive rusty-brown margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fertile fronds, which develop into sporangia.</p>
