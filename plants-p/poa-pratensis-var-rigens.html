                    <h1>Poa pratensis var. rigens</h1>
<p>Poa pratensis var. rigens, commonly known as rigid meadow grass, is a variant of the tall fescue species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, tufted foliage, which makes it well-suited for turfgrass applications. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly rough texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in lawns and pastures due to its hardiness and ability to form a dense sod.</p>
