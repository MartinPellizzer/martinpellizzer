<p>Polypodium circinatum, commonly known as the curled fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, tightly rolled young fronds that gradually unfurl as they mature. The plant has a rhizome that is often covered in a thick, leathery sheath, which helps it retain moisture. Its fronds are typically bright green and can grow up to 30 inches in length.</p>
<p>Polypodium circinatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found on trees or rocks in forested areas.</p>
