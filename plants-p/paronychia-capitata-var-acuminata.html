                    <h1>Paronychia capitata var. acuminata</h1>
<p>Paronychia capitata var. acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-tipped sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters at the tips of its stems, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, soft hairs, which contribute to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal.</p>
