                    <h1>Palicourea trianae</h1>
<p>Palicourea trianae, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and typically grows on the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients from them. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, red berries that contain the seeds. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
