                    <h1>Polygonum cuspidatum var. hachidyoense</h1>
<p>Polygonum cuspidatum var. hachidyoense, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread rapidly and aggressively. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish-purple in color, and it produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near streams, ditches, and roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a problematic species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
