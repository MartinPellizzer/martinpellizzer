<p>Photinia mollis, commonly known as the redleaf photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its attractive, glossy, dark green leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates.</p>
