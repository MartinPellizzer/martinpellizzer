                    <h1>Piper geniculatum f. puberulum</h1>
<p>Piper geniculatum f. puberulum, commonly known as the hairy hill pepper, is a variant of the genus Piper native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other forms of the species. The plant produces small, oval-shaped berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red upon maturity. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ethnobotanical studies.</p>
