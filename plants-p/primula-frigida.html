                    <h1>Primula frigida</h1>
<p>Primula frigida, commonly known as the snow primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves that help protect it from harsh cold. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its cold tolerance, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
