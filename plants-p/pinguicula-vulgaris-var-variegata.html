<p>Pinguicula vulgaris var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are covered in glandular hairs, which secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant's leaves are often variegated with white and green patterns, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity to maintain its carnivorous adaptations.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its ability to absorb nutrients from captured prey, supplementing its nutrient-poor habitat.</p>
