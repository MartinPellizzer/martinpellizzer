<p>Pedilonum cochleatum, commonly known as the spiral lichen, is a unique species of lichen that exhibits a distinctive spiral growth pattern.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its crustose thallus, which adheres tightly to the substrate. The lichen's morphology includes a complex arrangement of lobes and areolae, contributing to its intricate appearance. It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate regions, thriving in humid and shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth form and ecological role, Pedilonum cochleatum is an important indicator species for assessing environmental conditions.</p>
