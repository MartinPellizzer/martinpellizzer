<p>Pastinaca rigens, commonly known as the wild parsnip, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and fern-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, and its roots are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and forest edges.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions and can cause skin irritation due to its phototoxic compounds.</p>
