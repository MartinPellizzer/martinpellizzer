                    <h1>Psilaea</h1>
<p>Psilaea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-ear, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers and hairy, often narrow leaves. The plants are typically found in dry, rocky habitats across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. Psilaea species are often annual or biennial herbs, with some varieties growing to only a few inches in height.</p>
<p>They play a minor role in traditional medicine but are primarily of interest in botanical studies due to their unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
