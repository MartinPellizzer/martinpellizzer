                    <h1>Paramongaia viridiflora</h1>
<p>Paramongaia viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered orchid, is a rare tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking emerald-green petals and vibrant yellow stamens, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season, and are pollinated by specific species of bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Paramongaia viridiflora is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
