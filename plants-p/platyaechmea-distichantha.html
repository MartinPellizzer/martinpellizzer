                    <h1>Platyaechmea distichantha</h1>
<p>Platyaechmea distichantha, commonly known as the silver pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, silver-blue leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, often followed by small, orange fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is popular as a houseplant and in tropical gardens.</p>
