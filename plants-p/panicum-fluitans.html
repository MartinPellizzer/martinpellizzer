                    <h1>Panicum fluitans</h1>
<p>Panicum fluitans, commonly known as floating panicgrass, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that grow directly from the water's surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and float on the water, helping it to remain buoyant.</p>
<p>Panicum fluitans plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
