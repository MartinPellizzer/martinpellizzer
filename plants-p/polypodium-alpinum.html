                    <h1>Polypodium alpinum</h1>
<p>Polypodium alpinum, commonly known as the alpine wall-ruffle, is a fern species native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that typically grow in a rosette formation. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium alpinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize harsh, high-altitude habitats.</p>
