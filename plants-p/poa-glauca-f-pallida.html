                    <h1>Poa glauca f. pallida</h1>
<p>Poa glauca f. pallida, commonly known as the pale bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, which makes it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine environments. The plant produces small, pale blue to white florets that bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often thriving in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to form dense, mat-like growths.</p>
