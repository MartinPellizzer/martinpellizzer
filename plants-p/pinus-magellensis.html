<p>Pinus magellensis, commonly known as the Magellanic pine, is a coniferous tree native to southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender needles and its ability to thrive in harsh, coastal environments. The tree produces cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across rocky and sandy soils. Its root system is deep and resilient, allowing it to withstand strong winds and salt spray.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
