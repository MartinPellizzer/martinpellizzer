<p>Pellaea aspera, commonly known as the rough spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery, and often hairy fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pellaea aspera is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a distinctive member of the fern flora.</p>
