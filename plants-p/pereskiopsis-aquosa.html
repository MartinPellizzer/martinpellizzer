The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Pereskiopsis aquosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
