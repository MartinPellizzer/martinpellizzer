<p>Pectis rosea, commonly known as the pink dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright pink to red flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its seed heads, resembling those of dandelions, are equipped with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Pectis rosea is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun.</p>
