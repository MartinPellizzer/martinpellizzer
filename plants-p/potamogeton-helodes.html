<p>Potamogeton helodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater ecosystems in North America.</p>
<p>It has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by water currents. The plant is often found in shallow, slow-moving waters such as lakes, ponds, and rivers. It plays an important role in aquatic habitats by providing shelter for fish and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its dense growth can also impact water flow and sediment stability in its environment.</p>
