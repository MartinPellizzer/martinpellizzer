                    <h1>Polygala alpina</h1>
<p>Polygala alpina, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its low-growing habit. The plant features small, delicate flowers that are usually pink or purple, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, helping to reduce water loss in arid or cold climates.</p>
<p>Polygala alpina plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme environments.</p>
