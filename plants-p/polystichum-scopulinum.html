<p>Polystichum scopulinum, commonly known as the alpine wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in shaded forest floors or rocky habitats. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective shield called an indusium.</p>
<p>Polystichum scopulinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific humidity and light conditions.</p>
