                    <h1>Phyllocladus aspleniifolius var. alpinus</h1>
<p>Phyllocladus aspleniifolius var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine cliff-frond, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its modified leaves, known as phylloclades, which function as stems.</p>
<p>It is native to high-altitude regions of New Zealand and thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with fern-like fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
