                    <h1>Pleroma chamaecistus</h1>
<p>Pleroma chamaecistus, commonly known as the rock dudleya, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fleshy foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
