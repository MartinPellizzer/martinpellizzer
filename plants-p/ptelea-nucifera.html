                    <h1>Ptelea nucifera</h1>
<p>Ptelea nucifera, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green on top and paler underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, orange-to-red fruits that contain several seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy foliage and rapid growth rate.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
