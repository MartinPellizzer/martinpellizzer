<p>Plantago maritima subsp.</p>
<p>salsa, commonly known as sea plantain, is a coastal plant adapted to saline and sandy environments. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spike-like clusters, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in maritime climates and is often found along shorelines and dunes.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate salt spray and poor soil conditions makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
