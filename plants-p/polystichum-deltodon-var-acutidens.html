                    <h1>Polystichum deltodon var. acutidens</h1>
<p>Polystichum deltodon var. acutidens, commonly known as the sharp-pointed wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus Polystichum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with short, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to woodland gardens.</p>
