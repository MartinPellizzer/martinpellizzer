                    <h1>Phoradendron rugosum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron rugosum, commonly known as the roughleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with rough, leathery leaves and small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds. The plant produces a sticky substance called viscin, which helps it adhere to its host and facilitates seed dispersal. Its life cycle involves both aerial and root systems, with the roots penetrating the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the diversity of plant communities.</p>
