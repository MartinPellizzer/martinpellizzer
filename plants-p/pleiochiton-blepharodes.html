<p>Pleiochiton blepharodes, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the upper leaves being sterile and the lower ones producing spores.</p>
