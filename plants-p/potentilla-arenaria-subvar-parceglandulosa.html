                    <h1>Potentilla arenaria subvar. parceglandulosa</h1>
<p>Potentilla arenaria subvar. parceglandulosa, commonly known as the sandstone cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a suitable plant for xeriscaping and erosion control in harsh environments.</p>
