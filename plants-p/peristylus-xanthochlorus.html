                    <h1>Peristylus xanthochlorus</h1>
<p>Peristylus xanthochlorus, commonly known as the yellow chlorophyll fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bright yellow-green fronds that emit a subtle fluorescence under ultraviolet light. The plant thrives in high humidity and shade, often growing on the forest floor or on the trunks of large trees. Its unique coloration is due to the presence of specific pigments in its chloroplasts, which give it its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is rarely seen in the wild.</p>
