<p>Pisum sativum var. miroshnikovae, commonly known as the Miroshnikov's pea, is a rare botanical variant of the common pea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinct floral morphology and unique seed characteristics. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and exhibits a climbing habit with trifoliate leaves. Its flowers are usually pale blue or white, and the seeds are smaller than those of the standard pea variety.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
