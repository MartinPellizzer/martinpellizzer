                    <h1>Peltandra virginica</h1>
<p>Peltandra virginica, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and establish dense colonies in moist soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often aromatic when crushed, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences. It thrives in shallow water or saturated soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it is often used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
