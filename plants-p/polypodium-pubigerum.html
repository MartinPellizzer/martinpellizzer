                    <h1>Polypodium pubigerum</h1>
<p>Polypodium pubigerum, commonly known as the hairy cliff fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizome is often thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and establish itself in challenging habitats.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
