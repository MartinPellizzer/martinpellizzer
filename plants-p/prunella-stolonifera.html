                    <h1>Prunella stolonifera</h1>
<p>Prunella stolonifera, commonly known as creeping deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It features square stems and opposite leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, two-lipped flowers in whorls along the stems, typically in shades of purple or blue. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that can suppress other vegetation.</p>
