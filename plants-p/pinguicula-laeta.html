<p>Pinguicula laeta, commonly known as the golden butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant's leaves are typically bright green with a waxy coating, which aids in water retention. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the growing season, often in spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Pinguicula laeta thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions.</p>
