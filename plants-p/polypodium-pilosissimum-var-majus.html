<p>Polypodium pilosissimum var. majus, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
