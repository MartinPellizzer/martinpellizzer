                    <h1>Plagiogyria adnata var. adnata</h1>
<p>Plagiogyria adnata var. adnata, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, exhibiting a rhizomatous root system that aids in anchoring and nutrient absorption. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often float on the water surface, contributing to its aquatic habitat adaptation.</p>
<p>It plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic insects and stabilizing soil along water edges.</p>
