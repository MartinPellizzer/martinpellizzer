                    <h1>Pinus longifolia</h1>
<p>Pinus longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender needles that are typically 5 to 9 centimeters in length, arranged in bundles of two. The tree produces cones that are initially green but mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Its root system is extensive, helping to prevent soil erosion in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The longleaf pine is also notable for its ability to thrive in fire-prone ecosystems, where it has developed adaptations to survive periodic wildfires.</p>
