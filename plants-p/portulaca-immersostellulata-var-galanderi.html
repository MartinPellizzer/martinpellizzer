                    <h1>Portulaca immersostellulata var. galanderi</h1>
<p>Portulaca immersostellulata var. galanderi, commonly known as the Galander's moss rose, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming during the cooler hours of dawn and dusk. Its leaves are small, oval, and covered in a waxy cuticle, adapted to store water and minimize evaporation.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil.</p>
