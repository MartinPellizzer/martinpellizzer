                    <h1>Pleopeltis myriocarpa</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis myriocarpa, commonly known as the many-fruited rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit on tree trunks and rocks. The plant features lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a leathery texture and produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
