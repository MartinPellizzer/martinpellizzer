<p>Polyphlebium pyxidiferum, commonly known as the "cup-bearing moss," is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant's leaves are closely arranged and have a distinctive, often recurved shape, contributing to its unique appearance. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called cupules, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>This moss is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
