<p>Pulicaria grantii, commonly known as the Grant's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.

It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to drought and heat makes it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes.</p>
