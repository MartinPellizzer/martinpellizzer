                    <h1>Prasophyllum sylvicola</h1>
<p>Prasophyllum sylvicola, commonly known as the silver leek, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in swampy or seasonally waterlogged soils, often in association with other wetland flora. It has a short, underground rhizome and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
