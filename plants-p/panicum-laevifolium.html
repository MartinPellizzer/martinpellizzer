                    <h1>Panicum laevifolium</h1>
<p>Panicum laevifolium, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves with a silky texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue or silver flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open woodlands and prairies.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps.</p>
