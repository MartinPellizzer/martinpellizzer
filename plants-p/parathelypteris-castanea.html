                    <h1>Parathelypteris castanea</h1>
<p>Parathelypteris castanea, commonly known as the chestnut fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil or rock surfaces.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
