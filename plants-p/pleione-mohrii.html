                    <h1>Pleione mohrii</h1>
<p>Pleione mohrii, commonly known as the Mohri's orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in cool, humid environments with high altitude. The plant features a pseudobulb that supports its unique morphology, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, showy flower that blooms in spring. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pleione mohrii is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
