<p>Parodia concinna subsp.</p>
<p>blaauwiana, commonly known as the Blaauw's pincushion cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to southern Africa. It features a dense covering of white to pale green spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight.</p>

<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
