                    <h1>Phragmites communis var. nana</h1>
<p>Phragmites communis var. nana, commonly known as dwarf common reed, is a compact, clump-forming grass species native to wetlands across the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, making it significantly shorter than the common reed (Phragmites australis). The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, silver-green seed heads that are characteristic of the genus Phragmites. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along the shores of lakes and rivers.</p>
<p>Due to its dense growth, it can form dense stands that provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
