                    <h1>Poa compressa var. erecta</h1>
<p>Poa compressa var. erecta, commonly known as the upright meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, tufted foliage that often forms a low-growing mat. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
