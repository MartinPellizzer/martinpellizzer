                    <h1>Prumnopitys montana var. diversifolia</h1>
<p>Prumnopitys montana var. diversifolia, commonly known as the variable cedar or mountain cedar, is a deciduous conifer native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flat, linear leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs along the branches. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of conifers. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its variability in leaf shape and size, contributing to its common name.</p>
