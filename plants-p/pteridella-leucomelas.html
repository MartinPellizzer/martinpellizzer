<p>Pteridella leucomelas, commonly known as the white-veined fern, is a member of the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, white powder. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
