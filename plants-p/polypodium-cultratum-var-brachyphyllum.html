<p>Polypodium cultratum var. brachyphyllum, commonly known as the short-leaf holly fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical variety. The fronds are divided into numerous narrow segments, giving the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
