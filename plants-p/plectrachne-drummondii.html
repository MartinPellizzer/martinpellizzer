<p>Plectrachne drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's grass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the grass family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Drummond's grass is often found in open woodlands and shrublands, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
