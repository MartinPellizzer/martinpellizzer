<p>Poa macroglossa, commonly known as the giant sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Poa macroglossa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rugged landscapes.</p>
