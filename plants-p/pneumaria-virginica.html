                    <h1>Pneumaria virginica</h1>
<p>Pneumaria virginica, commonly known as the Virginia lungwort, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, velvety, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, unbranched stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, pink to purple flowers in the spring. Its leaves are distinctive for their irregularly shaped spots and markings, which resemble lung tissue, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Pneumaria virginica thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded areas with rich, loamy soil.</p>
