                    <h1>Paspalum redundans</h1>
<p>Paspalum redundans, commonly known as Florida paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its tolerance for waterlogged soils, it plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting wetland ecosystems.</p>
