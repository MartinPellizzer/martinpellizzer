<p>Pteronia quinquecostata, commonly known as the five-costate pteronia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations.</p>
<p>Pteronia quinquecostata is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
