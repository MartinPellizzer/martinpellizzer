<p>Pandanus taepa, commonly known as the red pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a reddish tinge. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which eventually develop into fibrous, spiky fruits. Pandanus taepa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has cultural significance in many island communities.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to coastal environments makes it a common sight in mangrove ecosystems.</p>
