<p>Pronephrium kumaunicum, commonly known as the Kumaon kidney fern, is a species of fern native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, compound fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms.</p>
