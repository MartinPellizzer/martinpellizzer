                    <h1>Potentilla verticillaris var. latisecta</h1>
<p>Potentilla verticillaris var. latisecta, commonly known as the broad-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with five broadly ovate leaflets, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period.</p>
