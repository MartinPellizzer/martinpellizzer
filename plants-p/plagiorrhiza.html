                    <h1>Plagiorrhiza</h1>
<p>Plagiorrhiza, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate flowers that often appear to be suspended in mid-air. The plant relies on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient absorption, as it cannot photosynthesize effectively on its own. Its flowers are typically white or pale in color, with a striking, almost translucent appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Plagiorrhiza is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
