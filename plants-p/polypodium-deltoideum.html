                    <h1>Polypodium deltoideum</h1>
<p>Polypodium deltoideum, commonly known as the deltoid fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, deltoid-shaped fronds that are typically divided into narrow, elongated segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in forested areas. Its rhizomes are wiry and can spread to form dense mats, contributing to its ability to colonize various substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen, with a leathery texture that helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
