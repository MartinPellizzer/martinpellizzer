<p>Phthirusa schneeana, commonly known as the snowflake orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that resemble snowflakes. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Phthirusa schneeana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
