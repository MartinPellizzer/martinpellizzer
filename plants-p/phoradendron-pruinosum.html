                    <h1>Phoradendron pruinosum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron pruinosum, commonly known as the silverleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are thick and waxy, often covered in a silvery, powdery coating that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>It plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
