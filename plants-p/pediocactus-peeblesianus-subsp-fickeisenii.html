<p>Pediocactus peeblesianus subsp.</p>
<p>fickeisenii, commonly known as the Peebles' cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico. It features a globular stem with a smooth, pale green surface that becomes more reddish in full sun.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted coloration. It is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
