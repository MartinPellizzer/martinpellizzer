                    <h1>Primula pauciflora var. zionensis</h1>
<p>Primula pauciflora var. zionensis, commonly known as the Zion primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Utah and Nevada.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinct yellow throat. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and slopes at elevations above 8,000 feet.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in the western United States.</p>
