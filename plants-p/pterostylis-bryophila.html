<p>Pterostylis bryophila, commonly known as the moss orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate plant with a green, leafy stem and a single, narrow, pale green or white flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as under rocks or in dense vegetation. Its flowers are often overlooked due to their small size and muted coloration.</p>
<p>Pterostylis bryophila relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological dependence on fungal symbiosis.</p>
