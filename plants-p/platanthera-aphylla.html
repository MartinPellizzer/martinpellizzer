                    <h1>Platanthera aphylla</h1>
<p>Platanthera aphylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its slender, white or pale green stems that often grow directly from the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in a raceme, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It thrives in wet, acidic pine flatwoods and is highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and ecological disturbances, it is listed as threatened in several states.</p>
