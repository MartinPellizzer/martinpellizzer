<p>Polypodium lepidopteris, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
