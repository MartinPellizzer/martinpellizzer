                    <h1>Platanthera × hybrida var. graebneri</h1>
<p>Platanthera × hybrida var. graebneri, commonly known as the Graebner's coralroot, is a hybrid orchid species native to central and eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb that lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in a spike, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species.</p>
<p>Due to its reliance on specific fungal partners, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
