<p>Polystichum phegopteris, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with fertile pinnae that bear spore-producing structures called sori. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of woodland ecosystems.</p>
