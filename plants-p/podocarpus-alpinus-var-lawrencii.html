                    <h1>Podocarpus alpinus var. lawrencii</h1>
<p>Podocarpus alpinus var. lawrencii, commonly known as the Alpine Podocarpus, is a rare evergreen shrub or small tree native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are tightly arranged along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody cones that contain edible seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
