<p>Pseudopodospermum elatum, commonly known as the giant hydnora, is a unique parasitic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other plants. The plant produces a distinctive, fleshy, yellowish flower that emits a strong odor to attract pollinators. Its structure is simple, with no true leaves or stems, and it reproduces through a complex process involving fungal spores.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized biology and habitat, it is considered rare and of significant botanical interest.</p>
