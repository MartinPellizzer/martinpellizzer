<p>Pterostylis subsimilis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly flies, which are attracted to its scent.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
