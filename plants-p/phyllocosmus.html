                    <h1>Phyllocosmus</h1>
<p>Phyllocosmus, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
