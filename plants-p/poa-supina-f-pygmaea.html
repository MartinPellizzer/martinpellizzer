                    <h1>Poa supina f. pygmaea</h1>
<p>Poa supina f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, with short, creeping stems and small, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and as a groundcover.</p>
