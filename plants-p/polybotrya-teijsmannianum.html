                    <h1>Polybotrya teijsmannianum</h1>
<p>Polybotrya teijsmannianum, commonly known as the Java fern, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread across substrates in freshwater environments. The plant features lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are often used in aquariums due to their aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. It is also noted for its ability to absorb heavy metals from water, making it useful in bioremediation efforts.</p>
<p>The spores of Polybotrya teijsmannianum are released from sporangia that are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
