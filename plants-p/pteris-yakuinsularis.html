                    <h1>Pteris yakuinsularis</h1>
<p>Pteris yakuinsularis, commonly known as the Yaku Island water fern, is a species of fern native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in its habitat.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
