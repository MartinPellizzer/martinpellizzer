                    <h1>Pepo</h1>
<p>Pepo, commonly known as a type of fruit, is a botanical term referring to a dry, one-seeded fruit with a thick, fleshy outer layer.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family of fruits known as berries, but it is distinct from true berries in its structure and development. Pepo fruits develop from the fusion of the ovary and the inferior receptacle, which is a unique characteristic in plant morphology. Examples include cucumbers, watermelons, and squash.</p>
<p>These fruits are often edible and play a significant role in both human consumption and ecological systems.</p>
