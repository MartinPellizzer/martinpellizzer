                    <h1>Platanthera gratissima</h1>
<p>Platanthera gratissima, commonly known as the sweet piper, is a species of orchid native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, flowering stem that typically grows to a height of 15â€“30 cm. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, often with a distinctive greenish tinge. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands, and its growth is closely associated with specific fungal symbionts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
