<p>It is a low-growing herb with a compact, bushy appearance and produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has hairy foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Ptilotus modestus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
