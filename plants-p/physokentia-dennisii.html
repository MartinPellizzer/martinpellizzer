                    <h1>Physokentia dennisii</h1>
<p>Physokentia dennisii, commonly known as the Dennis's areca palm, is a striking tropical plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that give it a lush, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into clustered, round fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in outdoor gardens in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
