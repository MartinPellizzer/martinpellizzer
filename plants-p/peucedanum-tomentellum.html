                    <h1>Peucedanum tomentellum</h1>
<p>Peucedanum tomentellum, commonly known as the woolly parsley or mountain angelica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely hairy, gray-green leaves that are often mistaken for those of other members of the Apiaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. Its roots are aromatic and have been historically used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Peucedanum tomentellum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
