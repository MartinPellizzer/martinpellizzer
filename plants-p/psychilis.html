                    <h1>Psychilis</h1>
<p>Psychilis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying solely on its roots for sustenance. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Psychilis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on the bases of cypress trees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
