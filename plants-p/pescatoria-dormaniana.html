                    <h1>Pescatoria dormaniana</h1>
<p>Pescatoria dormaniana, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and delicate, fragrant blooms that typically appear in spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal moths, which are attracted to its strong scent.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Pescatoria dormaniana is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
