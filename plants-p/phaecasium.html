<p>Phaecasium, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, often pale or translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plants typically have finely divided leaves and produce small, clustered inflorescences. Phaecasium species are native to various regions in Asia and are often found in moist, shady environments.</p>
