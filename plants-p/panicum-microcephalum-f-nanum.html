<p>Panicum microcephalum f. nanum, commonly known as dwarf bottlebrush grass, is a compact, low-growing grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, cylindrical inflorescences that resemble bottle brushes, typically in shades of red or brown. The plant is characterized by its small stature, with both foliage and flower spikes remaining close to the ground. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>This ornamental grass is valued for its unique appearance and ability to form dense, attractive clumps in garden settings.</p>
