The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is often of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
