                    <h1>Phylloglossum</h1>
<p>Phylloglossum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Phylloglossum species have rhizomes that produce both roots and new shoots, allowing for vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bipinnate, with finely divided leaves that contribute to its ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
