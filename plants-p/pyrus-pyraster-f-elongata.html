<p>Pyrus pyraster f. elongata, commonly known as the elongated whitebeam, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the whitebeam tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that give it a unique appearance compared to typical whitebeam species. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland habitats. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sour fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
