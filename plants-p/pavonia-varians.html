<p>Pavonia varians, commonly known as the scarlet pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant is often found in open woodlands, roadsides, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty.</p>
<p>Pavonia varians is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens.</p>
