<p>Phialodiscus welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia mirabilis, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is one of the oldest surviving plant species, with a lineage dating back over 140 million years. The plant features a thick, woody trunk and large, leathery leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. Its distinctive seed cones are covered in a thick, fibrous layer that protects the seeds until they are ready to germinate.</p>
