                    <h1>Pappobolus</h1>
<p>Pappobolus, commonly known as the burrweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their distinctive bracts that form a prickly, seed-bearing structure known as a pappus. The pappus serves as a dispersal mechanism, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind. Pappobolus species are typically annual or perennial herbs, often found in disturbed soils and arid environments.</p>
<p>They have small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in heads, typical of the Asteraceae family.</p>
