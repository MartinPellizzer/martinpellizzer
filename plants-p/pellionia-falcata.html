                    <h1>Pellionia falcata</h1>
<p>Pellionia falcata, commonly known as the silver millefleur, is a tropical perennial plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and dense clusters of small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hair. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, which are followed by small, round berries. Pellionia falcata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as a ground cover in tropical gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its lush foliage rather than its flowers.</p>
