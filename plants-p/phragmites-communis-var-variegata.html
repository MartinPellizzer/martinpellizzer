<p>Phragmites communis var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated common reed, is a variant of the common reed characterized by its distinctive variegated foliage.</p>
<p>It is a tall, perennial grass that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, lakeshores, and tidal flats. The plant has hollow, jointed stems and produces feathery, plume-like inflorescences that are often used for ornamental purposes. Its leaves are usually lighter in color than those of the standard Phragmites communis, featuring a mix of green and white or yellow markings.</p>
<p>This variant is often cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
