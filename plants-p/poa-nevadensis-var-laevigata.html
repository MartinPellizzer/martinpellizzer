                    <h1>Poa nevadensis var. laevigata</h1>
<p>Poa nevadensis var. laevigata, commonly known as the smooth bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and a dense, mat-forming growth habit. This variety typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and open woodlands. Its leaves are smooth and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
