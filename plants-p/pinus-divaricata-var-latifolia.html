                    <h1>Pinus divaricata var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Pinus divaricata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf lodgepole pine, is a variant of the lodgepole pine native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broader, more flattened needles compared to the typical lodgepole pine, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The tree typically grows in high-elevation forests and is adapted to cold, dry environments. Its cones are often serotinous, meaning they remain closed until heated by fire, ensuring seed dispersal after forest fires.</p>
<p>This variety plays an important ecological role in mountainous ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability.</p>
