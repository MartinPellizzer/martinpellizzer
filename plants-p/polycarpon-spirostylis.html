<p>Polycarpon spirostylis, commonly known as the spiral-styled polycarpon, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of stamens, which gives it its specific epithet "spirostylis.". The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as coastal dunes and inland plains.</p>
<p>It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across arid regions.</p>
