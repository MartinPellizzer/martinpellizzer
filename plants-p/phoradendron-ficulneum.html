                    <h1>Phoradendron ficulneum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron ficulneum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, scale-like leaves and white, fleshy berries that contain seeds. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves birds dispersing its seeds, which then germinate on the branches of suitable host trees.</p>
