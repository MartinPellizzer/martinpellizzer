                    <h1>Pterigeron bubakii</h1>
<p>Pterigeron bubakii, commonly known as the Bubak's pterigium, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, hairy coating that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pterigeron bubakii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
