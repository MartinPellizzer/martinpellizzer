<p>Polystachya golungensis, commonly known as the Golung's spikegrass, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>This herbaceous plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has fibrous roots and produces rhizomes, which help it spread and establish in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
