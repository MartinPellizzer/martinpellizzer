The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery structure that contributes to its ornamental value.</p>
