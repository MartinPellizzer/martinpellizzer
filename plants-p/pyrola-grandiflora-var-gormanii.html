                    <h1>Pyrola grandiflora var. gormanii</h1>
<p>Pyrola grandiflora var. gormanii, commonly known as Gormanâ€™s snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features oval, leathery leaves that are typically evergreen, providing year-round foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by flies and beetles, as it lacks showy nectar-rich structures.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils in shaded forest environments.</p>
