<p>Polystichum delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by indusia. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Polystichum delavayi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant, fern-like appearance.</p>
