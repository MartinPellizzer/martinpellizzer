<p>Panicum densifolium, commonly known as denseleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
