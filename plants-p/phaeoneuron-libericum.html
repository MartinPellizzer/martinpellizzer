                    <h1>Phaeoneuron libericum</h1>
<p>Phaeoneuron libericum, commonly known as the European marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in peat bogs and damp meadows, where it thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The species is of conservation concern due to habitat loss and is protected in several European countries.</p>
