                    <h1>Pombalia jefensis</h1>
<p>Pombalia jefensis, commonly known as the Jefenian ghost fern, is a rare and elusive plant native to the dense, humid rainforests of the Jefenian Highlands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions in the dim light of the forest understory. The plant's unique morphology includes a short, creeping rhizome with clustered sporangia that produce spores in late spring. Pombalia jefensis thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soil and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern and is often studied for its ecological and botanical significance.</p>
