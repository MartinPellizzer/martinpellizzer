<p>Polypodium subtripinnatum, commonly known as the three-pinnate shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into three primary pinnae, giving it a tripartite appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
