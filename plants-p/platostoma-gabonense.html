                    <h1>Platostoma gabonense</h1>
<p>Platostoma gabonense, commonly known as the Gabon shield fern, is a species of fern native to Central and West Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in water absorption.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bioluminescent, a unique trait that helps the plant attract nocturnal pollinators.</p>
