                    <h1>Porospermum</h1>
<p>Porospermum, commonly known as the "porous seed" plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique seed structure, which features a porous, spongy coating that aids in water absorption. Porospermum species are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, where they have adapted to survive in dry environments. They often grow as shrubs or herbs, with hairy stems and lobed leaves.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants.</p>
