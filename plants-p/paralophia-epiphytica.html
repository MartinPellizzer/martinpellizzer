                    <h1>Paralophia epiphytica</h1>
<p>Paralophia epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic orchid, is a species of orchid that grows on other plants, typically in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its epiphytic lifestyle, meaning it derives its moisture and nutrients from the air, rain, and debris accumulating around its roots. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale pink in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the environment rather than from soil.</p>
<p>Paralophia epiphytica is often found in shaded, humid environments where it can thrive without direct sunlight.</p>
