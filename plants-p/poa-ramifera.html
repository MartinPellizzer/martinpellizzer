<p>Poa ramifera, commonly known as the ramose bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often branch at the base. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typical of the Poaceae family, with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.
