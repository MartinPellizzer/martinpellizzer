<p>Paspalum floridanum, commonly known as Florida paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils, it plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland habitats.</p>
