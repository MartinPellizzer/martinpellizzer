<p>Polypodium spectabile, commonly known as the cliff brake, is a fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium spectabile is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize challenging habitats.</p>
