<p>Portulaca remota, commonly known as the desert purslane, is a low-growing, succulent annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are typically green or reddish, adapted to store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Portulaca remota is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions, making it a common weed in dry environments.</p>
