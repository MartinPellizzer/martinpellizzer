                    <h1>Persicaria criopolitana</h1>
<p>Persicaria criopolitana, commonly known as the Arctic knotgrass, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, moist environments such as tundra and rocky slopes, where it forms dense mats. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Persicaria criopolitana is adapted to harsh climates, with a compact growth form and a short growing season.</p>
