                            <h1>Pavonia Uniflora</h1>
<p>Pavonia uniflora is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant known for its vibrant red blooms and unique appearance. Native to the southern United States, it thrives in coastal and sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. This plant is often mistaken for a shrub due to its dense growth habit and trailing stems. Its showy flowers, which appear in clusters, make it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Despite its ornamental appeal, Pavonia uniflora also plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and ecosystems.</p>
