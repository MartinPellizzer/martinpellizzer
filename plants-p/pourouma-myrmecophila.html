                    <h1>Pourouma myrmecophila</h1>
<p>Pourouma myrmecophila, commonly known as the antplant, is a climbing plant native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called domatia, which are hollow, stem-like formations that provide shelter for colonies of ants. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and help with nutrient cycling by farming fungi within the plant's hollow stems. The plant's leaves are large and palmately lobed, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Its unique relationship with ants makes it an important component of the rainforest ecosystem.</p>
