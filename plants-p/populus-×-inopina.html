                    <h1>Populus × inopina</h1>
<p>Populus × inopina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf poplar, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Populus balsamifera and Populus deltoides.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5–10 cm in length. The plant is native to the northern regions of North America, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that aid in its wind-dispersed reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is often used in reforestation and erosion control efforts.</p>
