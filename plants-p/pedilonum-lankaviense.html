<p>Pedilonum lankaviense, commonly known as the Sri Lankan starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, brightly colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are elliptical and covered in a fine, hairy texture, while its stems are slender and often trailing.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Pedilonum lankaviense is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
