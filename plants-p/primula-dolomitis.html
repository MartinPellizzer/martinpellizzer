                    <h1>Primula dolomitis</h1>
<p>Primula dolomitis, commonly known as the Dolomitic primrose, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Dolomites in Italy.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are basal, oval-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Primula dolomitis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
