                    <h1>Pinus parviflora subvar. todaiensis</h1>
<p>Pinus parviflora subvar. todaiensis, commonly known as the Todai pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical *Pinus parviflora*. The cones are small and often clustered, with scales that are thick and leathery. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
