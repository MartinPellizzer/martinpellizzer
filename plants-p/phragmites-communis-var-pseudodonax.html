<p>Phragmites communis var. pseudodonax, commonly known as the narrow-leaved common reed, is a variant of the common reed found in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that forms dense stands in marshes, shores, and other moist habitats. The plant has long, slender, often narrow leaves that are typically lighter in color compared to the standard variety. Its flowering spikes are tall and cylindrical, producing fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
