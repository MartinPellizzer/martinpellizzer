<p>Pilea macrocarpa, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a member of the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to China and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that resemble small coins. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers followed by bright red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Pilea macrocarpa is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
