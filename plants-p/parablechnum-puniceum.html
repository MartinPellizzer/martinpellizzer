<p>[WRONG START] parablechnum puniceum, commonly known as the red-flowered lichen, is a unique plant that exhibits both lichen and moss-like characteristics.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocky surfaces or tree trunks in temperate regions. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body made up of fungal and algal components. Its vibrant red coloration comes from the pigments produced by the algal partner within the lichen.</p>
<p>Parablechnum puniceum plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
