                    <h1>Phyllocactus crenatus var. lateritius</h1>
<p>Phyllocactus crenatus var. lateritius, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular shape with thick, waxy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts.</p>
