                    <h1>Polygonum foliosum var. paludicola</h1>
<p>Polygonum foliosum var. paludicola, commonly known as swamp knotweed, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively through underground stems. The plant features heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain wetland environments if not managed properly.</p>
