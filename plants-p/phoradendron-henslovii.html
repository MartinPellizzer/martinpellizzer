                    <h1>Phoradendron henslovii</h1>
<p>Phoradendron henslovii, commonly known as the Henslow's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it obtains photosynthetic energy independently. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in supporting birdlife and maintaining forest biodiversity.</p>
