<p>Pholiurus filiformis, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it can float or anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its roots are often absent, and it relies on its bladders for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
<p>Pholiurus filiformis is an efficient predator, capable of capturing and digesting prey as small as protozoa and tiny crustaceans.</p>
