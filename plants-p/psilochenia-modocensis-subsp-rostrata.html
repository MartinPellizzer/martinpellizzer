<p>Psilochenia modocensis subsp.</p>
<p>rostrata, commonly known as the Modoc Valley psilochenia, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the Modoc Plateau in California. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
