<p>Paspalum distichum var. longirepens, commonly known as the longleaf paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rhizomatous growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically 10â€“30 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to tolerate flooding and its ecological importance, it plays a significant role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
