<p>It features a ribbed, cylindrical body with a smooth, pale green to blue-gray surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
