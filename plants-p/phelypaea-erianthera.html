                    <h1>Phelypaea erianthera</h1>
<p>Phelypaea erianthera, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in the leaf axils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
