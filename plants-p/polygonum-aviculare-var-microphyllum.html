                    <h1>Polygonum aviculare var. microphyllum</h1>
<p>Polygonum aviculare var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaf smartweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly in disturbed soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, compact clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist environments such as roadsides, fields, and wet meadows.</p>
