<p>Potamogeton microcarpus, commonly known as the small-fruited pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater ecosystems in North America.</p>
<p>It has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, greenish flowers that are often clustered in spikelets. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, contributing to the formation of dense underwater vegetation.</p>
<p>Potamogeton microcarpus plays a vital role in aquatic habitats by providing shelter for fish and invertebrates.</p>
