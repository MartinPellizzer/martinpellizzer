<p>Pinus rigensis, commonly known as the Siberian pine, is a coniferous tree native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Siberia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically arranged in bundles of five and have a bluish-green hue. The tree produces cone-shaped seed structures that contain winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Pinus rigensis is well adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
