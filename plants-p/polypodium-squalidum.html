                    <h1>Polypodium squalidum</h1>
<p>Polypodium squalidum, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's fronds are typically divided into lobes that resemble the tines of a stag's antlers, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Polypodium squalidum is valued both for its ornamental appearance and its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
