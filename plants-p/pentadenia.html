                    <h1>Pentadenia</h1>
<p>Pentadenia, commonly known as the white-flowered mistletoe, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Pentadeniaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Australia and Southeast Asia. They are hemiparasitic, meaning they derive some of their nutrients from host trees while also performing photosynthesis. Pentadenia species typically have small, simple leaves and produce showy, white or yellowish flowers.</p>
<p>Their seeds are often dispersed by birds, which rely on the berries for food.</p>
