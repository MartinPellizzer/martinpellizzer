                    <h1>Pistia africana</h1>
<p>Pistia africana, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, and it spreads through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>Pistia africana is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats and can become invasive in non-native environments.</p>
