<p>Phedimus middendorffianus, commonly known as the creeping phedimus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically thick and rounded, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, with its foliage often dying back in winter and regrowing in the spring.</p>
