<p>Pinguicula juratensis, commonly known as the Juratense butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded or humid environments. Its flowers are small and usually pink or purple, arranged in a raceme.</p>
<p>Pinguicula juratensis is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor habitats by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
