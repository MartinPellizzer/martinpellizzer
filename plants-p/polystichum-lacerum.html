                    <h1>Polystichum lacerum</h1>
<p>Polystichum lacerum, commonly known as the frayed wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of Asia, particularly China and Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found growing in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time.</p>
<p>Polystichum lacerum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shaded garden settings.</p>
