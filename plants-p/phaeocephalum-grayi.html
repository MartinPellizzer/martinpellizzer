                    <h1>Phaeocephalum grayi</h1>
<p>Phaeocephalum grayi, commonly known as the gray beard lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark gray to black thallus with a distinctive, fuzzy margin. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and rain. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator of air quality.</p>
