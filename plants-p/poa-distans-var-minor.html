                    <h1>Poa distans var. minor</h1>
<p>Poa distans var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often inconspicuous, with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental and habitat-providing qualities.</p>
