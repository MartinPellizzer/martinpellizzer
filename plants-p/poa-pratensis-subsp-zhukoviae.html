<p>Poa pratensis subsp.</p>
<p>zhukoviae, commonly known as Zhukov's meadow grass, is a rare and lesser-known subspecies of the common meadow grass. It is native to specific regions of Central Asia, particularly Kazakhstan, where it thrives in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>This grass is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a botanically interesting but endangered plant.</p>
