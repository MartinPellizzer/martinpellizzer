                    <h1>Populus deltoides var. mesetae</h1>
<p>Populus deltoides var. mesetae, commonly known as the Mesetaaspen, is a deciduous tree native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, triangular leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with low oxygen levels.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and potential for horticultural use.</p>
