<p>Physaria argyraea var. diffusa, commonly known as the silverleaf sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, silver-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun.</p>
