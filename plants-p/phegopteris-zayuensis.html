<p>Phegopteris zayuensis, commonly known as the Yarlung Zangbo fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in mountainous regions at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>This species is of particular interest to botanists due to its ecological significance and limited distribution.</p>
