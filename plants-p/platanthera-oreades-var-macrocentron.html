                    <h1>Platanthera oreades var. macrocentron</h1>
<p>Platanthera oreades var. macrocentron, commonly known as the large-centred lady's-orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes, often in areas with rich, humusy soil. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variant is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
