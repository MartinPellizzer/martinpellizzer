                    <h1>Phlox reptans</h1>
<p>Phlox reptans, commonly known as creeping phlox, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, blooming in early spring. The plant has trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form thick mats. Its foliage is typically dark green and slightly hairy, providing a lush backdrop to its vibrant blooms.</p>
<p>Creeping phlox is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, and as ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
