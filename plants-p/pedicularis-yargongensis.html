<p>Pedicularis yargongensis, commonly known as the Yarlung Valley lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often resembling the shape of a louse, hence its common name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
