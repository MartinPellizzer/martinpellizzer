<p>Plantago napiformis, commonly known as the broadleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive swollen base resembling a turnip, which stores nutrients for regrowth. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, due to its tolerance for poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its medicinal properties, with its leaves used traditionally for their healing and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
