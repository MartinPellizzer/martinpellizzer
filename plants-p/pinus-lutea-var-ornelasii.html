                    <h1>Pinus lutea var. ornelasii</h1>
<p>Pinus lutea var. ornelasii, commonly known as the Ornelas's yellow pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to specific regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its yellowish-green needles and distinctive cone morphology. It typically grows in high-altitude habitats, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposures. The tree is relatively small, with a slow growth rate, making it a valuable but challenging species for cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
