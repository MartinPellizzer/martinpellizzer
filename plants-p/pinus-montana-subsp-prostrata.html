<p>prostrata, commonly known as the creeping mountain pine, is a low-growing coniferous shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It is characterized by its prostrate or匍匐 growth habit, with multiple stems forming a dense mat on the ground.</p>
<p>The needles are typically short, dark green, and arranged in bundles of five, while the cones are small and woody. This subspecies is adapted to harsh, rocky environments and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems, providing habitat and soil stabilization in extreme conditions.</p>
