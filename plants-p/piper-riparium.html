                    <h1>Piper riparium</h1>
<p>Piper riparium, commonly known as the water pepper, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Piper riparium thrives in moist, shady conditions and is often found along stream banks and in marshy areas.</p>
