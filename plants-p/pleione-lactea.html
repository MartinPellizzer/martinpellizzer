                    <h1>Pleione lactea</h1>
<p>Pleione lactea, commonly known as the white pleione, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white flowers with a subtle pinkish hue, which bloom during the winter months. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, typical of many orchids, which stores water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-shaped, providing a lush backdrop to its delicate blossoms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pleione lactea is considered a conservation concern.</p>
