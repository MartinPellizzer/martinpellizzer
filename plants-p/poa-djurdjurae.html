                    <h1>Poa djurdjurae</h1>
<p>Poa djurdjurae, commonly known as the Djurdjura grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats on rocky slopes. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with pale green to golden florets that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and坚韧, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Poa djurdjurae plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for high-altitude wildlife.</p>
