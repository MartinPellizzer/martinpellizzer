<p>Platystele minimiflora, commonly known as the miniature-flowered marsh orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its tiny, delicate flowers and short, creeping rhizomes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in swampy or seasonally flooded areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are usually white or pale green, with a very small, elongated structure resembling a spur.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
