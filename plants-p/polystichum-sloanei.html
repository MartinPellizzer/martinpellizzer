<p>Polystichum sloanei, commonly known as the Sloane's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Polystichum sloanei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
