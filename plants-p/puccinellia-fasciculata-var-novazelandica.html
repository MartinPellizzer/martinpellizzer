                    <h1>Puccinellia fasciculata var. novazelandica</h1>
<p>Puccinellia fasciculata var. novazelandica, commonly known as New Zealand tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy environments, showing some tolerance to salt spray and wind. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing coastal dunes and its adaptation to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
