<p>Polanisia jamesii, commonly known as the James' polypody, is a small evergreen fern native to the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 inches in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to substrates, while its spores are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Polanisia jamesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
