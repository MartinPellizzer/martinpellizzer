<p>Peltobryon dichotomum, commonly known as the dichotomous moss, is a small, acrocarpous moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, green to yellow-green foliage, which is often covered in a layer of pseudoparaphyllia. The leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate, with a gradually tapered apex and a distinct costa that extends nearly to the leaf tip. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or on the bark of trees.</p>
<p>This moss is known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions due to its thick, protective cuticle and desiccation tolerance.</p>
