<p>Piptatherum kuoi, commonly known as the coastal meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils. The plant typically grows in dense mats, forming a low-growing vegetation that stabilizes dunes and prevents erosion. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Piptatherum kuoi plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
