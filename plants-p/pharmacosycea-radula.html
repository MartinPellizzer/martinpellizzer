<p>Pharmacosycea radula, commonly known as the medicinal liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leafy, thallus-like structure that often forms dense mats on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, flattened body composed of specialized cells. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing on rock surfaces or in damp, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its historical use in traditional medicine, it has been studied for its potential pharmacological properties.</p>
