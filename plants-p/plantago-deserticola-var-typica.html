                    <h1>Plantago deserticola var. typica</h1>
<p>Plantago deserticola var. typica, commonly known as the desert plantain, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette growth form, with dense, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are wind-pollinated. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in low-nutrient conditions.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
