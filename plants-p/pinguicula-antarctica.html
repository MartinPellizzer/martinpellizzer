                    <h1>Pinguicula antarctica</h1>
<p>Pinguicula antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the extreme environments of Antarctica.</p>
<p>It thrives in the cold, nutrient-poor conditions of the continent, using its sticky, glandular leaves to trap and digest small invertebrates. The plant's leaves are covered in tiny, hair-like structures that secrete digestive enzymes, allowing it to absorb essential nutrients. It is one of the few flowering plants that survive in such harsh, icy climates.</p>
<p>Its ability to adapt to extreme cold and limited nutrients makes it a unique example of botanical resilience.</p>
