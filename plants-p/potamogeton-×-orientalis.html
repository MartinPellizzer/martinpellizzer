                    <h1>Potamogeton × orientalis</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × orientalis, commonly known as the hybrid water milfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Potamogeton perfoliatus and Potamogeton praelatus. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in pairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>However, it can also become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native species.</p>
