                    <h1>Phegopteris borneensis</h1>
<p>Phegopteris borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself to submerged substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Phegopteris borneensis plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation for various microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
