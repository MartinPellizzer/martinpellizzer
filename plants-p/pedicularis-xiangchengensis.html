                    <h1>Pedicularis xiangchengensis</h1>
<p>Pedicularis xiangchengensis, commonly known as the Xiangcheng lousewort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Pedicularis, which is part of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family. The plant is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from red to orange, often resembling the shape of a louse, hence its common name. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine meadows at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique floral morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
