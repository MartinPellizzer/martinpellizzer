                    <h1>Polystichopsis muscosa</h1>
<p>Polystichopsis muscosa, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in temperate climates.</p>
