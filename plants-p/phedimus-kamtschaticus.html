                    <h1>Phedimus kamtschaticus</h1>
<p>Phedimus kamtschaticus, commonly known as the Siberian groundcover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe and Western Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to golden flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated in cooler climates for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
