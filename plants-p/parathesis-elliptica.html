                    <h1>Parathesis elliptica</h1>
<p>Parathesis elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are modified into haustoria. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in dense forests.</p>
<p>Its presence can weaken the host tree over time, making it both ecologically significant and potentially harmful to its host.</p>
