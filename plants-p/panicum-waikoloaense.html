                    <h1>Panicum waikoloaense</h1>
<p>Panicum waikoloaense, commonly known as the Waikoloa panicgrass, is a rare grass species native to the Hawaiian island of Oahu.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny grains of pollen. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its unique genetic makeup and limited distribution make it a valuable subject for botanical research.</p>
