<p>Piriqueta viscosa, commonly known as sticky piriqueta, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glandular leaves that secrete a sticky resin, which gives the plant its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is drought-tolerant. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>The sticky resin has been used historically in traditional medicine for its antiseptic properties.</p>
