                    <h1>Plantago borysthenica</h1>
<p>Plantago borysthenica, commonly known as the Siberian plantain, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Siberia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves contain mucilage, making it useful in traditional medicine for soothing inflammation and aiding digestion.</p>
<p>This hardy species is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils along riverbanks and in alpine regions.</p>
