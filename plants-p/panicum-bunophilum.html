<p>Panicum bunophilum, commonly known as silverleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves.

It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Panicum bunophilum is often used in ornamental landscaping for its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
