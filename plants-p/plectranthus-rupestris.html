                    <h1>Plectranthus rupestris</h1>
<p>Plectranthus rupestris, commonly known as the stone plant or rock fig, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white or grayish pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Plectranthus rupestris is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage.</p>
