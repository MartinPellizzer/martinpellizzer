                    <h1>Pteris pseudodactylina</h1>
<p>Pteris pseudodactylina, commonly known as the false bird's nest fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome that produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The leaves are leathery and dark green, contributing to its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
