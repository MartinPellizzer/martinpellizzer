<p>Paspalum robustum, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, making it an important species for coastal dune stabilization.</p>
<p>Paspalum robustum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in ecological restoration projects.</p>
