<p>Polypodium poloense, commonly known as the Polynesian maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a rosette shape. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of moss-like tissue, which helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Polypodium poloense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
