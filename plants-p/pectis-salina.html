                    <h1>Pectis salina</h1>
<p>Pectis salina, commonly known as saltbrush, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has silver-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh, saline environment. Pectis salina typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to high levels of salt and drought.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for native wildlife in desert ecosystems.</p>
