                    <h1>Pappostipa frigida var. parvispicula</h1>
<p>Pappostipa frigida var. parvispicula, commonly known as the small-spiked bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in disturbed or marginal soils.</p>
