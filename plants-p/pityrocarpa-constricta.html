                    <h1>Pityrocarpa constricta</h1>
<p>Pityrocarpa constricta, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a slow-growing, evergreen tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark bark and small, leathery leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by small, spherical fruits containing a single seed. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Pityrocarpa constricta plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for various desert wildlife.</p>
