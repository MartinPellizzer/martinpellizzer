<p>Pimpinella araucana, commonly known as the Andean cowparsley, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its biennial life cycle, with the first year producing only leaves and the second year producing flowers and seeds. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, hairy, triangular capsule, which aids in seed dispersal.</p>
