                    <h1>Pteris yunnanensis</h1>
<p>Pteris yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia, particularly China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Pteris yunnanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
