                <h1>Parodia werneri</h1>
<p>Parodia werneri, commonly known as the Werneri's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular plant with a thick, ribbed stem that typically measures between 5 and 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant features a dense covering of white or pale blue spines, which give it a unique and striking appearance. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise subdued foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation.</p>
