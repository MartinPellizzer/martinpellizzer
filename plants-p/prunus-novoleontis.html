                    <h1>Prunus novoleontis</h1>
<p>Prunus novoleontis, commonly known as the Leon's cherry, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Prunus genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of white and pink. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to cherries but are not widely cultivated. Native to a specific region in Central Asia, it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
