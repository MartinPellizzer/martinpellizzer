                    <h1>Plantago sericea var. monticola</h1>
<p>Plantago sericea var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain plantain, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense rosettes of soft, silver-gray, silky-haired leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in narrow spikes. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system makes it a valuable plant for soil stabilization in harsh, high-elevation habitats.</p>
