                    <h1>Pseudobombax calcicola</h1>
<p>Pseudobombax calcicola, commonly known as the limestone ceiba, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmate leaves that are typically 20â€“30 cm in diameter. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and bats. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Pseudobombax calcicola thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those rich in calcium, and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
