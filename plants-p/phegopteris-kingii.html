                    <h1>Phegopteris kingii</h1>
<p>Phegopteris kingii, commonly known as the King's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in photosynthesis in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds and are dispersed by wind, facilitating its spread in suitable habitats.</p>
