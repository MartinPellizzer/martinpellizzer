                    <h1>Pilostyles stawiarskii</h1>
<p>Pilostyles stawiarskii, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic parasitic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, often attaching itself to the roots of other plants. The plant is notable for its elongated, thread-like stems and its ability to produce small, ephemeral flowers that bloom for only a few hours. Due to its unique life cycle and limited distribution, it is considered one of the most elusive plants in the botanical world.</p>
<p>Its study provides valuable insights into parasitic plant adaptations and ecological interactions.</p>
