                    <h1>Pedicularis breviflora</h1>
<p>Pedicularis breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the high alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
