                    <h1>Puccinellia decumbens</h1>
<p>Puccinellia decumbens, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in environments with limited water availability. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective pioneer species in disturbed or degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Puccinellia decumbens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife and livestock.</p>
