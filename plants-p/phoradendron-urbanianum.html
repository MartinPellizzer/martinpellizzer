                    <h1>Phoradendron urbanianum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron urbanianum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted for this parasitic lifestyle. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its evergreen foliage remains throughout the year, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Phoradendron urbanianum plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for certain bird species and influencing the health of its host trees.</p>
