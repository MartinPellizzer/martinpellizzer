<p>Phoradendron merae, commonly known as Merae's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Viscaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in the Caribbean. This plant attaches itself to host trees, such as mangroves and other hardwoods, through its haustellum, which allows it to absorb water and nutrients. Its small, white or pale green leaves are clustered at the tips of its branches, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds.</p>
<p>Phoradendron merae plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
