<p>Peristrophe dewevrei, commonly known as the African dwarf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands.</p>
<p>Peristrophe dewevrei is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
