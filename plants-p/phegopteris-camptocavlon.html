                    <h1>Phegopteris camptocavlon</h1>
<p>Phegopteris camptocavlon, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant features a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in nutrient-poor soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats.</p>
