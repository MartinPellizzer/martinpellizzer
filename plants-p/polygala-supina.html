                    <h1>Polygala supina</h1>
<p>Polygala supina, commonly known as the prostrate milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Polygala supina is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it an important component of desert and rocky habitats.</p>
