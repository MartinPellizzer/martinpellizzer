                    <h1>Parosela gracillima</h1>
<p>Parosela gracillima, commonly known as the slender parosela, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its small, daisy-like flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, elongated fruits called achenes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parosela gracillima is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
