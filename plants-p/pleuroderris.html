<p>Pleuroderris, commonly known as the rock wallaby or rock wallaby lichen, is a type of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form, often forming dense, tightly adherent layers on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale to dark grey, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found on limestone or other calcareous substrates.</p>
<p>Pleuroderris species are known for their chemical composition, which includes depsides and depsidones, contributing to their ecological role in nutrient cycling.</p>
