                    <h1>Polypodium henriquesii</h1>
<p>Polypodium henriquesii, commonly known as the Henriques' holly fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
