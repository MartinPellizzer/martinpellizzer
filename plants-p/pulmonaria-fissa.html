<p>Pulmonaria fissa, commonly known as the divided lungwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a bluish-gray hue due to dense pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, typically blooming in early spring. Its name derives from the resemblance of its foliage to the human lung, a characteristic noted in its common names.</p>
<p>Pulmonaria fissa thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal.</p>
