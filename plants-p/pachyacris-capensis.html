<p>Pachyacris capensis, commonly known as the Cape grasshopper, is a species of short-horned grasshopper native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acrididae and is characterized by its robust body and cryptic coloration that helps it blend into its grassland habitat. The plant associated with this species is not a plant but an insect, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss.</p>
<p>Therefore, the query is based on a misunderstanding.</p>
