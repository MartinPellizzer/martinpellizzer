                    <h1>Pentaphylloides rehderiana</h1>
<p>Pentaphylloides rehderiana, commonly known as the Hainan cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the island of Hainan in China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a branched structure, which are followed by woody, cone-like seed pods. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
