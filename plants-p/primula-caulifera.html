<p>Primula caulifera, commonly known as the cauliflower primrose, is a unique species within the Primulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unusual habit of producing flowers on the stems and branches rather than at the tips, a trait known as cauliflorous growth. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks, across parts of Asia. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with showy petals that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This species is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting biodiversity.</p>
