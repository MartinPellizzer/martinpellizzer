<p>Populus × moskoviensis, commonly known as the Siberian poplar, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to eastern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Populus genus, which includes poplars, aspens, and cottonwoods, and is characterized by its rapid growth and adaptability to various environmental conditions. The tree typically grows to a height of 15–25 meters, featuring smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Populus × moskoviensis is often used in reforestation and afforestation projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
