                    <h1>Paspalum dilatatum var. decumbens</h1>
<p>Paspalum dilatatum var. decumbens, commonly known as velvetgrass, is a perennial grass native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and soft, hairy foliage that gives it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range.</p>
