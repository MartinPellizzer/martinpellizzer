                    <h1>Platanthera dilatata var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Platanthera dilatata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh-orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and bogs in North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typically open during the early morning. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
