<p>Ponerorchis taitungensis, commonly known as the Taitung ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate floral structure and striking, translucent petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are notable for their pale green to white coloration and lack of a strong fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ponerorchis taitungensis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
