<p>Polypodium androgynum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with feather-like fronds that are bipinnate, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous cover.</p>
<p>Polypodium androgynum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
