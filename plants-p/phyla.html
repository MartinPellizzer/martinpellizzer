                    <h1>Phyla</h1>
<p>Phyla, commonly known as divisions in the classification of plants, represent a major taxonomic rank that groups organisms based on shared structural and genetic characteristics.</p>
<p>In botany, the term "phyla" refers to broad categories that encompass all plant life, such as vascular plants, non-vascular plants, and algae. Each phylum is characterized by distinct morphological and physiological traits, such as the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. These classifications help scientists understand evolutionary relationships and ecological roles within plant communities.</p>
<p>The study of phyla is fundamental to the field of botany, providing a framework for the diversity of plant life on Earth.</p>
