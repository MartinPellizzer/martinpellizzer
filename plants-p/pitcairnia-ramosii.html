                    <h1>Pitcairnia ramosii</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia ramosii, commonly known as the branched pitcairnia, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for hydration. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with showy, often red or orange flowers that attract pollinators. Its foliage is typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia ramosii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique botanical features.</p>
