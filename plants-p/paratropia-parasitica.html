                    <h1>Paratropia parasitica</h1>
<p>Paratropia parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the stems of its host, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant forms a dense, leafy growth that can cover large sections of the host's branches. It reproduces via seeds dispersed by birds that eat its fleshy berries.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique parasitic relationship and its role in the ecological dynamics of its native Australian habitats.</p>
