                    <h1>Pteris borneensis</h1>
<p>Pteris borneensis, commonly known as the Borneo water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in swampy areas or near water bodies. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Pteris borneensis plays an important ecological role in its native environment by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
