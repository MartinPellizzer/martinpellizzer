                    <h1>Padus laurocerasus</h1>
<p>Padus laurocerasus, commonly known as the cherry laurel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features dark green, glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by dark blue-black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its aromatic foliage and dense growth make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
<p>However, due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care.</p>
