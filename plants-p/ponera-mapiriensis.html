                    <h1>Ponera mapiriensis</h1>
<p>Ponera mapiriensis, commonly known as the Mapiri antplant, is a unique species of antplant native to the tropical rainforests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leafy structure that provides shelter for colonies of ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant's leaves are typically elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing for efficient water retention in humid environments. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized relationship with ants, Ponera mapiriensis plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
