<p>Pedicularis oederi subsp.</p>
<p>heteroglossa, commonly known as the yellow labellum orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on its host for nutrients while still performing some photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its striking yellow and orange flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
