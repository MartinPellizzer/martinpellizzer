<p>Parthenium alpinum, commonly known as mountain ragweed, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes and South America.</p>
<p>It is an annual herb with slender stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its widespread distribution in alpine regions. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a distinctive, slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>Parthenium alpinum is adapted to cold, rocky environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas.</p>
