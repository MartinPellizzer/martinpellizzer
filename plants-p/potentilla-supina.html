                    <h1>Potentilla supina</h1>
<p>Potentilla supina, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, or pink, depending on the variety. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance.</p>
