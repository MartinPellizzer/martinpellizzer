<p>Pteris andamanica, commonly known as the Andaman water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Pteris andamanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
