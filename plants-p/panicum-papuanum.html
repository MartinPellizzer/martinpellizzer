                    <h1>Panicum papuanum</h1>
<p>Panicum papuanum, commonly known as the Papuan panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands, particularly New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps it to retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Panicum papuanum is typically found in open, disturbed areas such as forest edges and rocky soils.</p>
