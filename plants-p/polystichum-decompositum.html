                    <h1>Polystichum decompositum</h1>
<p>Polystichum decompositum, commonly known as the decomposed fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds, which are divided into two levels of pinnae, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polystichum decompositum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
