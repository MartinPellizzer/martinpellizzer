<p>Peperomia diaphana var. hilariana, commonly known as the silver peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features dense, glossy, dark green foliage with a silvery-white underside, giving it a striking, almost metallic appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color, which are not the main ornamental feature. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care.</p>
