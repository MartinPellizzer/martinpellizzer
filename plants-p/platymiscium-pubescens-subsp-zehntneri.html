<p>Platymiscium pubescens subsp.</p>
<p>zehntneri, commonly known as the Zehntner's flat-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and inconspicuous white flowers.</p>
<p>The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which connect to the vascular system of the host. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical forest environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on parasitic plant ecology and host interactions.</p>
