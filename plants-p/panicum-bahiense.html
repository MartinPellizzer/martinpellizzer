<p>Panicum bahiense, commonly known as Bahia grass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for lawns and erosion control. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to spread aggressively, forming dense turf.</p>
<p>Panicum bahiense is also valued for its ability to withstand heavy traffic and maintain its color throughout the growing season.</p>
