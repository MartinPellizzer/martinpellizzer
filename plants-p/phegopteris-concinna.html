<p>Phegopteris concinna, commonly known as the slender cliff brake, is a fern species native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small groups called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors.</p>
<p>Phegopteris concinna plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
