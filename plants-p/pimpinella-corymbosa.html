<p>Pimpinella corymbosa, commonly known as clustered cowparsley, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its small white flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, smooth fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Pimpinella corymbosa is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily.</p>
