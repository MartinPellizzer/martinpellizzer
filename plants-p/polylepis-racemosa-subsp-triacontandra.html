<p>Polylepis racemosa subsp.</p>
<p>triacontandra, commonly known as the Andean wax tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-white foliage and distinctive, cone-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cool, humid climates at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. Its leaves are leathery and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in cloud forests and is adapted to the extreme conditions of the Andean region.</p>
