<p>Peddiea fischeri var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough peddiea, is a unique species within the genus Peddiea, characterized by its distinctive, rugged foliage.</p>
<p>This variant is native to specific regions of South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are thick and leathery, with a rough texture that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered near the base of the stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Peddiea fischeri var. coriacea is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
