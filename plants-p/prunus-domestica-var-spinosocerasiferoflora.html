                    <h1>Prunus domestica var. spinosocerasiferoflora</h1>
<p>Prunus domestica var. spinosocerasiferoflora, commonly known as the spiny cerasing-flowered plum, is a rare and highly specialized variant of the domesticated plum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and unique, cerasing (crimson) flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with dense foliage, making it suitable for ornamental purposes. Its fruits, though less commonly cultivated, are small and tart, with a high acidity level.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its unusual morphological traits and potential genetic significance.</p>
