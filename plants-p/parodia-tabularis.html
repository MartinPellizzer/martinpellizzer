                    <h1>Parodia tabularis</h1>
<p>Parodia tabularis, commonly known as the "Cactus of the Desert," is a species of cactus native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white to pale green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are relatively short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Parodia tabularis is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
