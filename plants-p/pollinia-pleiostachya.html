<p>Pollinia pleiostachya, commonly known as the orchid with clustered pollinia, is a species of orchid characterized by its unique floral structure.</p>
<p>It possesses a single, elongated flower spike that bears several small, clustered flowers. The most distinctive feature is the presence of pollinia, which are masses of pollen grains that are typically attached to a sticky base. These pollinia are adapted for transfer by specialized pollinators, such as bees or wasps.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, humid environments.</p>
