                    <h1>Paspalum haumanii var. genuinum</h1>
<p>Paspalum haumanii var. genuinum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its smaller leaf size and more compact growth habit compared to other paspalum species.</p>
