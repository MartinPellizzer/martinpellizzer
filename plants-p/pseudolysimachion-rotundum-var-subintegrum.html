<p>It features dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
