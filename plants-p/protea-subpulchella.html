                    <h1>Protea subpulchella</h1>
<p>Protea subpulchella, commonly known as the silver protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that resemble a cluster of white flowers, although they are actually composed of many small, individual florets. The plant thrives in the fynbos biome, where it adapts to nutrient-poor soils and Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, providing structural support and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>The protea subpulchella is also notable for its role in attracting pollinators such as birds and insects.</p>
