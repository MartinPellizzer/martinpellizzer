<p>Pteris arguta var. tremula, commonly known as the trembling fern, is a variant of the common water fern.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks. The plant features delicate, pinnately divided fronds with a distinctive, tremulous movement due to its finely serrated leaflets. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
