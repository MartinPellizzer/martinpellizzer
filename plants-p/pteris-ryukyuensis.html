<p>Pteris ryukyuensis, commonly known as the Ryukyu water fern, is a species of fern native to the Ryukyu Islands in Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates.</p>
