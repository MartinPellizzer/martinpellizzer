<p>Phlegmariurus hypogaeus, commonly known as the common earth moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on the ground or on rocks. The plant has a dense, mat-like growth form with a prostrate stem that produces small, leaf-like structures called thallus. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are typically found on the upper surface of the thallus.</p>
