                    <h1>Phoradendron glandulosum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron glandulosum, commonly known as the hairy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It possesses small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of glandular hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in small umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Its parasitic nature allows it to absorb water and nutrients from the host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The botanical characteristics of Phoradendron glandulosum make it a unique and ecologically significant component of its forest ecosystem.</p>
