<p>Pedicularis allorrhampha, commonly known as the broad-leaved lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes parasitic and hemiparasitic plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, often resembling the shape of a louse, hence its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in its often cool and humid habitat.</p>
