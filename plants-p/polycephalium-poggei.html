                    <h1>Polycephalium poggei</h1>
<p>Polycephalium poggei, commonly known as the Italian polypody, is a small, evergreen fern native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically 10â€“20 cm in length, with a bipinnate structure that gives it a finely divided appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a characteristic feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky soils or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in the wild.</p>
