                    <h1>Phellopterus glaucus</h1>
<p>Phellopterus glaucus, commonly known as the white-leafed saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silvery-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
