                    <h1>Polystichum × gemmilachenense</h1>
<p>Polystichum × gemmilachenense, commonly known as the hybrid lady fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Polystichum setiferum and Polystichum acutiforme.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species, with a generally more refined appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its fronds are usually evergreen, with a dark green coloration and a leathery texture.</p>
<p>While it does not produce spores, it can propagate through the growth of gemmae, small vegetative propagules that form on the underside of its fronds.</p>
