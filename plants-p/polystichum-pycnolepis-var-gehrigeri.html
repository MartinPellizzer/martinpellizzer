                    <h1>Polystichum pycnolepis var. gehrigeri</h1>
<p>Polystichum pycnolepis var. gehrigeri, commonly known as the Gehriger's dense fern, is a variant of the dense wood fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tightly packed, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that form a compact, upright clump. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in small, spore-bearing structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings.</p>
