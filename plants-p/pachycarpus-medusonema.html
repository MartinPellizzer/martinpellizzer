                    <h1>Pachycarpus medusonema</h1>
<p>Pachycarpus medusonema, commonly known as the star-shaped spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, star-like formations. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to low-water conditions through its thick, water-storing tissues.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
