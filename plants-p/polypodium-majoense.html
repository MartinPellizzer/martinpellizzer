<p>Polypodium majoense, commonly known as the Majoense fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a compact, rosette-like formation. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate moisture and indirect light. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium majoense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
