<p>Pinus protuberans, commonly known as the mountain pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, needle-like leaves that grow in clusters of five. The tree produces cones that are typically red or purple, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its roots are adapted to anchor in rocky soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh, mountainous environments.</p>
<p>The bark of Pinus protuberans is thick and scaly, providing protection against fires and extreme weather conditions.</p>
