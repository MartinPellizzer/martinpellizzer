                    <h1>Pedicularis kolymensis</h1>
<p>Pedicularis kolymensis, commonly known as the Kolyma lousewort, is a rare flowering plant native to the extreme northern regions of Russia and Siberia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic growth habit. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often growing in rocky or alpine areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
