<p>Psittacanthus flagellaris, commonly known as the flagellate fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a flagellum, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize aquatic sediments.</p>
<p>Psittacanthus flagellaris plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
