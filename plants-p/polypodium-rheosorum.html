<p>Polypodium rheosorum, commonly known as the red-stemmed polypody, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green to yellow-green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Polypodium rheosorum is often found growing on tree trunks or among leaf litter, where it can absorb moisture from the air.</p>
