<p>Phoradendron californicum var. leucocarpum, commonly known as the white-fruited mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to California.</p>
<p>It attaches to the branches of host trees, such as oaks and maples, using a specialized root system called haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are evergreen, glossy, and arranged in pairs along the stems.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its pale, waxy fruit compared to other mistletoe species.</p>
