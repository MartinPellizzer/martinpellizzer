<p>Potentilla arenaria subsp.</p>
<p>incana, commonly known as silver sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically has silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to cold climates makes it an important component of polar and alpine ecosystems.</p>
