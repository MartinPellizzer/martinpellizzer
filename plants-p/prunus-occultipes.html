                    <h1>Prunus occultipes</h1>
<p>Prunus occultipes, commonly known as the ghost cherry, is a rare and elusive species of shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has small, oval leaves with a smooth surface and a slightly hairy underside. Its fruit is a small, dark red drupe that ripens in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Prunus occultipes is considered a botanically significant but critically endangered species.</p>
