                    <h1>Pterostylis dubia</h1>
<p>Pterostylis dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale green or white flowers that resemble a ghostly outline, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and has a fibrous root system. It produces a single, slender stem with a single flower, which is pollinated by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Pterostylis dubia is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
