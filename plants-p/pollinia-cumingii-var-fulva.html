                    <h1>Pollinia cumingii var. fulva</h1>
<p>Pollinia cumingii var. fulva, commonly known as the golden pollinia orchid, is a variant of the Pollinia cumingii species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow pollinia, which are specialized structures that facilitate pollination in orchids. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a unique morphology adapted for specific pollinators.</p>
<p>The varietal name 'fulva' refers to the vivid, orange-yellow coloration of its pollinia, setting it apart from other variants of the species.</p>
