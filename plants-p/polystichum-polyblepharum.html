<p>Polystichum polyblepharum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broadly ovate to lanceolate fronds that are deeply divided into segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies over time.</p>
