                    <h1>Pinguicula alpestris</h1>
<p>Pinguicula alpestris, commonly known as the alpine butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to mountainous regions in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, rosette-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its flowers are typically white or pink and bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Pinguicula alpestris plays a role in nutrient cycling in nutrient-poor soils by capturing and digesting insects.</p>
