<p>Poa sinaica subsp.</p>
<p>moabitica, commonly known as the Sinai bentgrass, is a grass species native to the arid regions of the Middle East, particularly found in Israel and the Sinai Peninsula. It is a low-growing, perennial plant that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often found in rocky crevices and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
