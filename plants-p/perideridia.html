                    <h1>Perideridia</h1>
<p>Perideridia, commonly known as meadow knapweed, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and their showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. Perideridia species are typically found in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. They have fibrous roots and produce small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
