<p>Pteris guizhouensis, commonly known as the Guizhou water fern, is a species of fern native to China, particularly in the Guizhou province.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Pteris guizhouensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
