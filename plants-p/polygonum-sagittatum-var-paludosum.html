The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in marshes, pond edges, and other moist habitats, often forming dense stands.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
