                    <h1>Phaca inflata</h1>
<p>Phaca inflata, commonly known as the inflated bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the inflated bladders are its primary photosynthetic organs.</p>
<p>Phaca inflata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by both capturing prey and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
