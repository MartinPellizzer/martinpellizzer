                    <h1>Potentilla proanserina</h1>
<p>Potentilla proanserina, commonly known as the mountain potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with slender stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Potentilla proanserina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
