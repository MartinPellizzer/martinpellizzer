                    <h1>Pycreus unioloides var. angulatus</h1>
<p>Pycreus unioloides var. angulatus, commonly known as the angular pycreus, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific freshwater habitats in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, elongated leaves that often have a distinct angular appearance. The plant typically grows in slow-moving streams and ponds, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water's surface.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health.</p>
