                    <h1>Pteris ensiformis var. rheophila</h1>
<p>Pteris ensiformis var. rheophila, commonly known as the water fern or river fern, is a variant of the common water fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams and in humid forests. The plant has pinnately divided fronds with a distinctive, narrow, sword-like shape, which gives it its common name. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across wetland areas.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, making it well adapted to its moist habitat.</p>
