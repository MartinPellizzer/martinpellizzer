<p>Pyrola noveboracensis, commonly known as the New York snowbank, is a rare and delicate evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are typically borne on the same stems as the leaves. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture in its cool, moist habitats.</p>
<p>Pyrola noveboracensis thrives in shaded, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and subalpine regions.</p>
