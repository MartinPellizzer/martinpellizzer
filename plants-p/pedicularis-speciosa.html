                    <h1>Pedicularis speciosa</h1>
<p>Pedicularis speciosa, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, slipper-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
