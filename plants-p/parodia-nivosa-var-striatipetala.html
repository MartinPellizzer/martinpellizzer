                    <h1>Parodia nivosa var. striatipetala</h1>
<p>Parodia nivosa var. striatipetala, commonly known as the Snowy Parodia, is a succulent plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with a dense cluster of cylindrical, ribbed leaves that are typically pale green to white in color. The leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a subtle touch of color to its otherwise muted appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its compact growth and unique, frost-like appearance.</p>
