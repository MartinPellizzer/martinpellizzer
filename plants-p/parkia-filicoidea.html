                <h1>Parkia filicoidea</h1>
<p>Parkia filicoidea, commonly known as the featherleaf acacia, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are finely divided and resemble feathers, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes cultivated for ecological and agricultural purposes.</p>
