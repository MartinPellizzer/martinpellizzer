                    <h1>Potentilla umbrosa var. minor</h1>
<p>Potentilla umbrosa var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact foliage with small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and alpine settings.</p>
