<p>Polypodium ornatissimum, commonly known as the ornate water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are adorned with fine, intricate vein patterns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates such as rocks or decaying wood.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
