                    <h1>Peniocereus serpentinus</h1>
<p>Peniocereus serpentinus, commonly known as the serpentine night bloomer, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers at night, which are typically short-lived but attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well-suited for desert conditions.</p>
<p>The species is also notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often reaching maturity over several decades.</p>
