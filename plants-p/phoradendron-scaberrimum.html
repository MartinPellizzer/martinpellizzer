                    <h1>Phoradendron scaberrimum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron scaberrimum, commonly known as the roughleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and has a unique life cycle that involves both vegetative growth and seed dispersal by birds. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, green leaves that allow it to photosynthesize partially. Its berries are typically red or yellow and serve as a food source for birds, which in turn aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>The plant's parasitic nature can impact the health of its host trees, making it an important ecological component in forest ecosystems.</p>
