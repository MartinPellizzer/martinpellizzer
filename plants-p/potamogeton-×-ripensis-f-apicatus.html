                    <h1>Potamogeton × ripensis f. apicatus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × ripensis f. apicatus, commonly known as the sharp-tipped pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant exhibits a distinctive apiculate (sharp-tipped) morphology, which is a defining feature of this form. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its morphological traits, it is often found in association with other pondweeds and can be an indicator of nutrient-rich waters.</p>
