                    <h1>Prosopis globosa</h1>
<p>Prosopis globosa, commonly known as the globosa mesquite, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically reduced to spines in mature plants, and its distinctive globular fruit pods. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access groundwater. It produces small, yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody pods containing edible seeds.</p>
<p>Prosopis globosa is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
