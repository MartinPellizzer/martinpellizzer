<p>Platyopuntia spinibarbis, commonly known as the spiny beard cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Its spiny, barbed bristles provide protection against herbivores and help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Platyopuntia spinibarbis is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes.</p>
