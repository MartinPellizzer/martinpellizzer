                    <h1>Pterochiton</h1>
<p>Pterochiton, commonly known as the sea snail, is a genus of marine gastropod mollusks belonging to the family Pterochitontidae.</p>
<p>These organisms are characterized by their calcareous, shell-like structures that provide protection against predators. They are typically found in shallow marine environments, such as coral reefs and rocky substrates. Pterochitons are herbivorous, feeding primarily on algae and other plant matter.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology and ecological role make them important components of coastal ecosystems.</p>
