<p>Prumnopitys amara, commonly known as the bitter fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that mature to release seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in forest ecosystems. Prumnopitys amara thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in subalpine or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude forest communities.</p>
