<p>Polystichum aculeatum subsp.</p>
<p>angulare, commonly known as the angular holly fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in small, stiff spines.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shady, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
