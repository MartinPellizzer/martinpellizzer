                    <h1>Pteris angustipinna var. yamatensis</h1>
<p>Pteris angustipinna var. yamatensis, commonly known as the Yamatō narrow-pinnate fern, is a variant of the narrow-pinnate water fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically 30–60 cm long and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in humid, tropical regions.</p>
