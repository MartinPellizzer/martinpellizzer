<p>Polypodium lunanianum, commonly known as the moon fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has long, delicate fronds with a distinctive, pinnately compound structure. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The moon fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
