<p>Pholidia bickii, commonly known as the Bickii pomegranate, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It produces small, round, red or orange fruits that are similar in appearance to pomegranates, though they are not related. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The fruit is edible, with a tart flavor, and is often used in local cuisines and traditional medicine.</p>
