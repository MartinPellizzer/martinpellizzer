<p>Pseudotectaria biformis, commonly known as the two-lobed tectaria, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a bifurcated or two-lobed structure. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread across forest floors. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are arranged in a linear pattern on the underside of the fronds.</p>
