<p>Pharnaceum namaquense, commonly known as the Namaqua lily, is a perennial herb native to the succulent Karoo region of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, silver-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Pharnaceum namaquense is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements.</p>
