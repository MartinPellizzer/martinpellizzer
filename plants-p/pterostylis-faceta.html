                    <h1>Pterostylis faceta</h1>
<p>Pterostylis faceta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, hooded flower that is typically pale green to yellow in color. The plant produces a single, erect spike bearing one or two flowers, which are often hidden beneath the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys.</p>
<p>The orchid's flowering period usually occurs in spring, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
