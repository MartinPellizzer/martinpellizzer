                    <h1>Pinus taihangshanensis</h1>
<p>Pinus taihangshanensis, commonly known as the Taihang Mountain pine, is a rare and endemic coniferous species native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of two. The tree produces cones that are initially green but mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds for wind dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
