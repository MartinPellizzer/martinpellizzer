                    <h1>Pasania lycoperdon</h1>
<p>Pasania lycoperdon, commonly known as the common puffball, is a member of the Agaricaceae family and is characterized by its large, round, white to yellowish fruiting bodies.</p>
<p>It typically grows in grassy areas and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in gardens. The spore-producing structure, called a volva, is smooth and lacks a stem, distinguishing it from other similar fungi. The fruiting body matures into a dry, spore-filled sphere that releases spores when disturbed.</p>
<p>It is edible when young but becomes inedible and potentially toxic as it matures.</p>
