                    <h1>Psephellus xeranthemoides</h1>
<p>Psephellus xeranthemoides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with grey-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse seeds by wind. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits reflect its evolutionary adaptation to survive in extreme conditions.</p>
