                    <h1>Prionitis aucheri</h1>
<p>Prionitis aucheri, commonly known as the silver saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features a dense mat of silver-gray foliage with small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
