<p>Pedicularis muscoides subsp.</p>
<p>himalayca, commonly known as the Himalayan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes parasitic and hemiparasitic species.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of host plants while also performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
