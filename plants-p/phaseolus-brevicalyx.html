                    <h1>Phaseolus brevicalyx</h1>
<p>Phaseolus brevicalyx, commonly known as the short-leaf common bean, is a flowering plant species native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often used as a food source. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
<p>This makes it an important crop for sustainable agriculture due to its soil-enriching properties.</p>
