                    <h1>Potamogeton acutifolius var. major</h1>
<p>Potamogeton acutifolius var. major, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It has long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, which help reduce water resistance as it grows in deep water. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, often floating at the water's surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality in ponds and lakes.</p>
