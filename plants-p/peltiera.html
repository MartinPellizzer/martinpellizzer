                    <h1>Peltiera</h1>
<p>Peltiera, commonly known as the walking fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to "walk" by growing new shoots from the base of its fronds, which can detach and root in new locations. The plant has a rhizome that produces both roots and fronds, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, wavy appearance.</p>
<p>Peltiera thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
