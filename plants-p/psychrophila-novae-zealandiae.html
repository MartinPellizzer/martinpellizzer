<p>Psychrophila novae-zealandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand cold-loving plant, is a rare species native to the southern regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in alpine or subalpine regions where temperatures remain relatively low. The plant has adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions, with a compact growth form and dense foliage that helps insulate it from extreme cold. Its leaves are typically dark green and covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
