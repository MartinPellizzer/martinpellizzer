                    <h1>Populus tremuloides</h1>
<p>Populus tremuloides, commonly known as quaking aspen, is a deciduous tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trembling leaves that clatter in the wind, giving it its common name. The tree has smooth, light-gray bark that becomes furrowed with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are followed by samaras that aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>As a pioneer species, it plays a vital role in forest succession and ecosystem recovery.</p>
