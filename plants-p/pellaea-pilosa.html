                <h1>Pellaea pilosa</h1>
<p>Pellaea pilosa, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and horizontally spreading, allowing it to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
