<p>Pellaea arabica, commonly known as the Arabian spleenwort, is a species of fern native to the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into lance-shaped leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Pellaea arabica is adapted to arid environments and plays a minor role in the local flora of its native habitat.</p>
