                    <h1>Poa grisea</h1>
<p>Poa grisea, commonly known as grey hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades that give it its common name, and it often grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and meadows. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to a wide range of soil types and can tolerate moderate drought conditions.</p>
<p>Poa grisea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
