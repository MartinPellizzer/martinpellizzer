                    <h1>Potamogeton × upsaliensis</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × upsaliensis, commonly known as the hybrid water milfoil, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Potamogeton crispus and Potamogeton perfoliatus, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small fish and invertebrates.</p>
