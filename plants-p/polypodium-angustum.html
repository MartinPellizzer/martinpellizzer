                    <h1>Polypodium angustum</h1>
<p>Polypodium angustum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in the understory of dense forests. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Polypodium angustum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
