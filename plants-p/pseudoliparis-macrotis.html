<p>Pseudoliparis macrotis, commonly known as the giant deep-sea sea pen, is a unique cnidarian found in deep ocean environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the order Pennatulacea and is characterized by its long, flexible polyp-like structures. This species thrives in cold, dark waters at depths exceeding 200 meters, where it relies on filter feeding. Its body is composed of a central axial skeleton surrounded by a colony of polyps.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat, it is rarely observed and studied, making it a subject of scientific curiosity.</p>
