<p>Pseudoheterocaryum, commonly known as the false heterocaryum, is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Tulasnellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a basidiomycete structure with a distinctive, elongated, and often branched stalk. These fungi are typically found in association with certain plants, particularly in moist, shaded environments. They play a role in nutrient cycling by decomposing organic matter.</p>
<p>The genus is of interest to mycologists due to its unusual developmental features and potential ecological significance.</p>
