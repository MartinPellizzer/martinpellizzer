                    <h1>Pilostyles goyazensis</h1>
<p>Pilostyles goyazensis, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a rare and specialized plant that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic orchid, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from a host plant while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has a slender, thread-like stem that often grows in a coiled or spiral pattern. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish or brownish in color, which helps it blend with its host.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is found in limited habitats, primarily in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
