                    <h1>Palmorchis silvicola</h1>
<p>Palmorchis silvicola, commonly known as the forest palm orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, stout rhizome and a single, upright stem topped with a dense cluster of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, often growing on decaying wood or in leaf litter.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
