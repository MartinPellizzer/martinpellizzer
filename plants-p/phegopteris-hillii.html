                    <h1>Phegopteris hillii</h1>
<p>Phegopteris hillii, commonly known as the Himalayan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant thrives in cold, oligotrophic waters and is often found in mountain lakes and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Phegopteris hillii plays a minor but ecologically significant role in the aquatic ecosystems of its native habitat.</p>
