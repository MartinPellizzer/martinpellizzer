                    <h1>Pteroceras spathibrachiatum</h1>
<p>Pteroceras spathibrachiatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing cones called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>The plant's morphology and growth habits make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
