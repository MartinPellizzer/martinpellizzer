                    <h1>Polypodium polypodioides var. minimum</h1>
<p>Polypodium polypodioides var. minimum, commonly known as the small fern or dwarf polypody, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are usually less than 30 cm in length. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the substrate.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
