<p>Pseudencyclia boothiana, commonly known as the Booth's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique botanical species.</p>
