                    <h1>Pandaca mocquerysi var. parvifolia</h1>
<p>Pandaca mocquerysi var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved pandaca, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are small and ovate, with a velvety texture, and its flowers are usually pink or red, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
