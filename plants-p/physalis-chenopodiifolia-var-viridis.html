                    <h1>Physalis chenopodiifolia var. viridis</h1>
<p>Physalis chenopodiifolia var. viridis, commonly known as the greenleaf gooseberry, is a variant of the physalis genus characterized by its distinctive green foliage.</p>
<p>It is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. The plant produces small, yellow-orange berries enclosed in a papery calyx, similar to other physalis species. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats.</p>
