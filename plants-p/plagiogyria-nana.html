                    <h1>Plagiogyria nana</h1>
<p>Plagiogyria nana, commonly known as the dwarf plagiogyria, is a small perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, hairy stems and small, fern-like leaves. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and are usually white or pale green, adapting to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits.</p>
<p>Plagiogyria nana plays a role in its ecosystem by providing food for certain insects and serving as a pioneer species in disturbed or barren soils.</p>
