<p>Periphanes cinnamomea, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble a cinnamon stick.</p>
<p>It is native to North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a short, stout rhizome that supports its tall, arching fronds, which are divided into segments with a unique, cinnamon-like scent when crushed. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The cinnamon fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability.</p>
