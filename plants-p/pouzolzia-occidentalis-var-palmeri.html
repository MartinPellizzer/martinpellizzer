                    <h1>Pouzolzia occidentalis var. palmeri</h1>
<p>Pouzolzia occidentalis var. palmeri, commonly known as the desert broomrape, is a parasitic plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on species of the genus *Larrea*. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers and has a fibrous, root-like structure called a haustorium that attaches to the host. It is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
