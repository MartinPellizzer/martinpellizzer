                    <h1>Prunus × subhirtella var. stellata</h1>
<p>Prunus × subhirtella var. stellata, commonly known as the stellate cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is prized for its ornamental value, featuring clusters of white or pink flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves. The plant has a compact growth habit with a rounded form, making it suitable for small gardens or containers. Its leaves are ovate with a glossy surface and turn red in the fall.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, edible cherry that ripens in late summer, though it is often used more for ornamental purposes than for consumption.</p>
