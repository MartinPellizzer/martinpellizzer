                    <h1>Pyrethrum krylovianum</h1>
<p>Pyrethrum krylovianum, commonly known as the Krylovian pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called phloroglucinol, which are responsible for its insecticidal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its natural pest-repelling abilities, it is sometimes cultivated for organic pest control.</p>
