                    <h1>Pentapanax parasiticus var. khasianus</h1>
<p>Pentapanax parasiticus var. khasianus, commonly known as the Khasi parasitic pentapanax, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the northeastern regions of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and exhibits a unique adaptation by deriving some of its nutrients from host plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it attaches to the roots of other vegetation. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a glossy surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in umbels.</p>
<p>This variant is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its ecological role and potential medicinal properties.</p>
