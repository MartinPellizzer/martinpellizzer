                    <h1>Protea multibracteata</h1>
<p>Protea multibracteata, commonly known as the Cape mountain protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences composed of numerous small, tubular flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. The plant is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat, which is typical of many proteas. It thrives in areas with high rainfall and is often found in mountainous regions of the Western and Eastern Cape provinces.</p>
<p>The Cape mountain protea plays an important ecological role and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
