                            <h1>Pisonia Arborescens</h1>
<p>Coral tree, scientifically known as Pisonia arborescens, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is renowned for its vibrant, coral-like clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom throughout the year. The tree's unique appearance and ecological importance make it a popular subject in botanical studies and ornamental horticulture. Its delicate flowers are often surrounded by a cloud of tiny, sticky seeds that attract birds and insects, playing a vital role in pollination. Despite its beauty, the coral tree is also considered an invasive species in some regions, where it can outcompete native flora.</p>
