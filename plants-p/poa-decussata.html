                    <h1>Poa decussata</h1>
<p>Poa decussata, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, dense sod-forming habit and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a decussate pattern, meaning they cross each other in pairs. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Poa decussata is valued in horticulture for its fine texture and ability to form a dense, durable turf.</p>
