<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that typically range from white to pale yellow. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release its tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in coastal and inland wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species in its native range.</p>
