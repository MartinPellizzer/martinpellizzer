                    <h1>Poa eremophila</h1>
<p>Poa eremophila, commonly known as the desert grass or silver grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Poa eremophila is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited rainfall.</p>
