<p>Pleocnemia trimenii f. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected pleocnemia, is a rare and distinctive fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and often threatened species in its native range.</p>
