                    <h1>Picea excelsa f. parsonsii</h1>
<p>Picea excelsa f. parsonsii, commonly known as the Parson's white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its white bark, which is more pronounced than in typical white spruce, and its relatively smaller size compared to other spruce species. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in subalpine and alpine zones where conditions are harsh. The foliage is typically dark green, with short, stiff needles that are slightly twisted.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and ecological adaptations.</p>
