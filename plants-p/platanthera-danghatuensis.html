                    <h1>Platanthera danghatuensis</h1>
<p>Platanthera danghatuensis, commonly known as the Danghatu orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the monsoon season.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
