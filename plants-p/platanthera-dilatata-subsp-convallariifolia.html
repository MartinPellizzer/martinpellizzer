<p>Platanthera dilatata subsp.</p>
<p>convallariifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf marsh orchid, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a tall, slender stem with a single, showy flower that is typically white or pale green in color.</p>
<p>The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is common among orchids.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in bogs and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
