                    <h1>Pogonia miersii</h1>
<p>Pogonia miersii, commonly known as the Miers' ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale pink or white flowers with intricate, ghost-like patterns on the petals and sepals. The plant typically grows on decaying wood in moist, shaded forest environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the decomposing substrate, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Pogonia miersii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
