                    <h1>Pultenaea angustifolia var. viscosa</h1>
<p>Pultenaea angustifolia var. viscosa, commonly known as the sticky pultenaea, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, sticky resin, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in heathlands and dry forests.</p>
<p>The sticky resin on its leaves serves as a natural defense against herbivores and aids in water retention.</p>
