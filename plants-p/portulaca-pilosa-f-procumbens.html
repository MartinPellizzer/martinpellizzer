The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically appearing in summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to hot, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
