<p>Primula dissecta, commonly known as the dissected primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble a dissected pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is sensitive to extreme temperatures and requires well-drained soil.</p>
