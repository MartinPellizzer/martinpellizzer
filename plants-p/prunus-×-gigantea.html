                    <h1>Prunus × gigantea</h1>
<p>Prunus × gigantea, commonly known as the Japanese cherry tree, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Prunus serrulata and Prunus lannesiana.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and is often cultivated for its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces small, edible fruits known as cherries, which are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it has a shallow root system that makes it susceptible to windthrow.</p>
<p>Prunus × gigantea is widely planted in gardens and parks for its ornamental value and cultural significance.</p>
