<p>Petrocodon lithophilus, commonly known as the rock petrocodon, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish hues. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability. Its leaves are typically small and succulent, helping to conserve moisture in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Petrocodon lithophilus is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
