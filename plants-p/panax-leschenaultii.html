<p>Panax leschenaultii, commonly known as the Korean ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Korea, China, and Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered root system and lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are valued for their medicinal properties, containing ginsenosides that are believed to have adaptogenic and immune-boosting effects.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
