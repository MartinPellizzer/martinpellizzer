<p>Picea spinulosa subsp.</p>
<p>yatungensis, commonly known as the Yatung spruce, is a rare and endemic conifer native to high-altitude regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like foliage.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in mountainous forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
