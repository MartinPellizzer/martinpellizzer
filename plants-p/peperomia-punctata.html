                    <h1>Peperomia punctata</h1>
<p>Peperomia punctata, commonly known as the spotted peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving them a distinctive, waxy appearance. The leaves are typically green with irregularly spaced white or silver spots, which contribute to its ornamental value. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, usually in shades of white or pale pink, though these are not the primary attraction of the plant.</p>
<p>Peperomia punctata is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
