<p>Pandanus hendersonii, commonly known as Henderson's pandanus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Pandanaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the island of Henderson in the Pitcairn Islands, where it grows in coastal and lowland areas. The plant is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts by the local inhabitants. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in spadices, which eventually develop into fibrous, coconut-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
