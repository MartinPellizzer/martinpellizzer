                    <h1>Pareira</h1>
<p>Pareira, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Erythroxylum* species, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Erythroxylaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and features shrubs or small trees with simple, alternate leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered, often with five petals, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Many species within this genus are known for their medicinal properties, with some containing compounds used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, certain species are also sources of psychoactive substances, leading to their classification as controlled plants in many regions.</p>
