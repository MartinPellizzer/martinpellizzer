<p>Polypodium longiusculum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a rosette shape. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and can produce new plants through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
