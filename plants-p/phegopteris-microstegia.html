<p>Phegopteris microstegia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved maidenhair fern, is a species native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is a delicate fern characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically less than a meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its leaves are often described as having a subtle, metallic sheen, which contributes to its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
