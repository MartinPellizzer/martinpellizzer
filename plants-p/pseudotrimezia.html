<p>Pseudotrimezia, commonly known as the false trimezia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in the Caribbean and Central America. Pseudotrimezia species are characterized by their large, showy inflorescences composed of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe.
