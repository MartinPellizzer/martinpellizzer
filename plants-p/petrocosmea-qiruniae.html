<p>Petrocosmea qiruniae, commonly known as the Qirun stone orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>This orchid is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. The plant's unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile ecosystem and threats from habitat loss, Petrocosmea qiruniae is considered endangered.</p>
