<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, including parts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits enclosed in a papery calyx, which turn orange-red when ripe. Its leaves are typically hairy and adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
