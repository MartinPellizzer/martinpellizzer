                    <h1>Paraprasophyllum incorrectum</h1>
<p>Paraprasophyllum incorrectum, commonly known as the incorrect lichen, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically crustose and forms a thin, tightly adherent layer on substrates such as bark or stone. The plant exhibits a complex chemical composition, producing various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological interactions and resistance to environmental stressors. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecosystem health.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this elusive species from habitat degradation and climate change impacts.</p>
