<p>Psychotria speluncae subsp.</p>
<p>exserta, commonly known as the cave psychotria, is a rare tropical plant species native to the humid, shaded environments of cave systems in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and delicate, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale green or white.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in high humidity and low light conditions, making it a unique inhabitant of subterranean ecosystems. Its growth is often restricted to specific microhabitats within caves, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered vulnerable to environmental disturbances and habitat loss.</p>
