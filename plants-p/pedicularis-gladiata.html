                    <h1>Pedicularis gladiata</h1>
<p>Pedicularis gladiata, commonly known as the sword-leaved monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that resemble a sword. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
