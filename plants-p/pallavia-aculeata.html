                    <h1>Pallavia aculeata</h1>
<p>Pallavia aculeata, commonly known as the spiny mallows, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a rough, hairy texture that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Pallavia aculeata is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
