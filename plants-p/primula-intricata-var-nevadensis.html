<p>Primula intricata var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra primrose, is a perennial herb native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are adapted to cold, alpine conditions. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and lavender, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and open slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
