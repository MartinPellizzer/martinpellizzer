                    <h1>Poa jurana</h1>
<p>Poa jurana, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in mountainous areas and rocky soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Poa jurana is adapted to withstand harsh conditions, including strong winds and limited nutrients.</p>
