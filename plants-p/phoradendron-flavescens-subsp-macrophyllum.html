<p>Phoradendron flavescens subsp.</p>
<p>macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant produces fleshy, orange berries that are dispersed by birds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Its roots form haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in providing food for various bird species and its unique parasitic growth habit.</p>
