                    <h1>Persea carolinensis f. glabriuscula</h1>
<p>Persea carolinensis f. glabriuscula, commonly known as the smooth-leaved avocado, is a variant of the avocado tree characterized by its reduced pubescence.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, and thrives in subtropical climates. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in panicles, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The fruit, while edible, is generally smaller and less commercially significant compared to the standard avocado variety.</p>
