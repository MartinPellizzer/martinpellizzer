<p>Pyrrosia novoguineae, commonly known as the New Guinea fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often have a deep green color. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, and its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots. Pyrrosia novoguineae is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
