<p>Potentilla inclinata subsp.</p>
<p>subrecta, commonly known as the bentleaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, slightly curved leaves that give it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
