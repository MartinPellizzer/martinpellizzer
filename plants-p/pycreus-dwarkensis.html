<p>Pycreus dwarkensis, commonly known as the Dwarka orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the coastal regions of Gujarat, India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in a vibrant mix of white and purple hues. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found growing on rocky outcrops near the sea. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the saline air, making it well-suited to its coastal habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pycreus dwarkensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
