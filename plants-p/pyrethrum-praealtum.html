                    <h1>Pyrethrum praealtum</h1>
<p>Pyrethrum praealtum, commonly known as the highland pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which are the source of its natural insecticidal compounds. These compounds, known as pyrethrins, are widely used in organic pest control.</p>
<p>Pyrethrum praealtum thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous habitats.</p>
