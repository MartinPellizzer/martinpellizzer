                    <h1>Persicaria stagnina</h1>
<p>Persicaria stagnina, commonly known as swamp knotweed, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in wet environments.</p>
<p>Persicaria stagnina is often considered an indicator species for wetland ecosystems due to its specific habitat requirements.</p>
