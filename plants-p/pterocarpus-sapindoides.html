                    <h1>Pterocarpus sapindoides</h1>
<p>Pterocarpus sapindoides, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The tree produces unique, woody fruits that contain flat, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Its heartwood is highly valued for its rich reddish-brown color and fine grain, making it a prized timber species.</p>
<p>However, overharvesting has led to its classification as a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
