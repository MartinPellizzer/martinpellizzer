                    <h1>Paepalanthus nubigena</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus nubigena, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and its ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, adapted to the cool and moist conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are densely packed and often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid surroundings.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Paepalanthus nubigena is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
