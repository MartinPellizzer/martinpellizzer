                    <h1>Platostoma coloratum var. minutum</h1>
<p>Platostoma coloratum var. minutum, commonly known as the miniature yellow stinkhorn, is a small, fleshy fungus that belongs to the Phallaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, yellowish stem and a distinct, foul-smelling cap that attracts flies for spore dispersal. The fruiting body typically grows to a height of less than 5 centimeters, making it one of the smallest stinkhorns. It thrives in moist, decaying organic matter, often found in woodland areas during the summer months.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and reproductive strategy make it an interesting subject for mycological study.</p>
