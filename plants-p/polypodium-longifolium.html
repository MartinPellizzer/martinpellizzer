                    <h1>Polypodium longifolium</h1>
<p>Polypodium longifolium, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a creeping rhizome that produces erect, lance-shaped fronds with a glossy, dark green appearance. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a dense, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities.</p>
