                    <h1>Phyllorkis occlusa</h1>
<p>Phyllorkis occlusa, commonly known as the closed leaf lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form, which allows it to adhere tightly to rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale to dark gray, with a finely granular texture and a slight powdery appearance. It contains a variety of secondary metabolites, including usnic acid, which contributes to its chemical complexity.</p>
<p>This lichen is often found in temperate and subarctic regions, thriving in shaded, moist environments on tree bark and stone.</p>
