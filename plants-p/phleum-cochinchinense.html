<p>Phleum cochinchinense, commonly known as Vietnamese oat, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with parallel veins and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a ground cover.</p>
<p>The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread in suitable environments.</p>
