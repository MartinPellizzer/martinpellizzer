<p>Pachysandra axillaris subsp.</p>
<p>stylosa, commonly known as the slenderleaf pachysandra, is a low-growing evergreen groundcover native to eastern Asia. It features dark green, elliptical leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is commonly used in woodland gardens for its dense, mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>Its adaptability and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for erosion control and ground cover in shaded landscapes.</p>
