                    <h1>Phaianthes lurida</h1>
<p>Phaianthes lurida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers with a unique, almost translucent appearance. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
