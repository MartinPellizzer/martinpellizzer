<p>Pyrrocoma amplectens, commonly known as the clinging pygmy bellflower, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in late summer. The plant has a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
