<p>It features large, umbrella-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, with a distinctive purple stem marked by white spots. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in summer, which are followed by spherical, greenish-brown fruits. It is characterized by its strong, aromatic scent and is often found in moist, disturbed soils near rivers and roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a noxious weed and can pose a danger to humans and animals.</p>
