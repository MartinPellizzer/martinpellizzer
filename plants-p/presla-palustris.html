                    <h1>Presla palustris</h1>
<p>Presla palustris, commonly known as the marsh presla, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on the surface of shallow water or moist soil, with slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spikes and are pollinated by wind. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Presla palustris is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
