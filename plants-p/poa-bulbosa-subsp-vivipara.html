<p>Poa bulbosa subsp.</p>
<p>vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage, with slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, and its unique feature is the presence of viviparous shoots, which can develop into new plants while still attached to the parent. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in marginal environments.</p>
