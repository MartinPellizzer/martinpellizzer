<p>Pinus × ascendens nothosubsp.</p>
<p>ascendens, commonly known as the hybrid lodgepole pine, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Pinus contorta and Pinus banksiana. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically 5–10 cm long.</p>
<p>The cones are usually pendulous and can reach lengths of up to 15 cm, containing two to three seeds. This subspecies is native to the boreal forest regions of North America, where it thrives in cold, dry climates.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a pioneer species in forest succession and its value as a timber resource.</p>
