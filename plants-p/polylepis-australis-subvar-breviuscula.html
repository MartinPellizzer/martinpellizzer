                    <h1>Polylepis australis subvar. breviuscula</h1>
<p>Polylepis australis subvar. breviuscula, commonly known as the Andean polylepis, is a shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous bark and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in the cold, dry environments of the Andean cloud forests and p√°ramo ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, this species is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
