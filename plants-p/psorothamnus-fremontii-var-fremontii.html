                    <h1>Psorothamnus fremontii var. fremontii</h1>
<p>Psorothamnus fremontii var. fremontii, commonly known as Fremont's greasewood, is a shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and sagebrush habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing soils in semi-arid regions.</p>
