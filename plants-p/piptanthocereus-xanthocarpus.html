<p>Piptanthocereus xanthocarpus, commonly known as the yellow-fruited cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, typical of cacti adapted to dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water.</p>
<p>Piptanthocereus xanthocarpus is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh climates.</p>
