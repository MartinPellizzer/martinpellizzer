                            <h1>Phleum Dentatum</h1>
<p>Phleum dentatum is a hardy grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is commonly found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils due to its adaptability and resilience. This plant is known for its fine, tufted growth and distinctive toothed leaves that give it its scientific name. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability. Despite its modest appearance, Phleum dentatum is a valuable component of many ecological systems.</p>
