                    <h1>Picea abies f. chlorocarpa</h1>
<p>Picea abies f. chlorocarpa, commonly known as the green spruce or chlorocarpa spruce, is a naturally occurring variant of the Norway spruce.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its darker, more intensely green foliage compared to the typical silver-blue color of the parent species. The leaves are shorter and more densely packed, giving the tree a compact, lush appearance. This form is often found in specific microclimates where cooler temperatures and higher humidity promote the development of its distinctive coloration.</p>
<p>It is primarily of horticultural interest due to its aesthetic appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
