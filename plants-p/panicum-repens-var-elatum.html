<p>Panicum repens var. elatum, commonly known as tall flatsedge, is a grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a flat, grass-like structure. The plant produces fluffy, seed-bearing spikes that are typically borne on long, slender stalks. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
