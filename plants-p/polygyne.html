                    <h1>Polygyne</h1>
<p>Polygyne, commonly known as the polygyne ant, is a term used to describe a type of ant colony structure where multiple queens coexist within a single nest.</p>
<p>These colonies are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where the warm climate supports the high reproductive rates of the queens. The presence of multiple queens leads to a more complex social hierarchy and increased colony productivity. Each queen in a polygyne colony can lay eggs, contributing to the rapid growth of the colony.</p>
<p>This reproductive strategy is an adaptation to environmental conditions that favor large, resource-rich colonies.</p>
