<p>Pluchea marylandica, commonly known as Maryland ragweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer.
