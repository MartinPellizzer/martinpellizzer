<p>Polypodium surcurrens, commonly known as the running polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into small, serrated segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Polypodium surcurrens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in both natural and cultivated settings.</p>
