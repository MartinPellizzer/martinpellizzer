                    <h1>Pollinia mollis</h1>
<p>Pollinia mollis, commonly known as the soft pollinia orchid, is a unique species belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often yellowish pollinia, which are specialized structures used in pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in tropical or subtropical regions. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a complex structure that facilitates the transfer of pollinia to visiting insects.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Pollinia mollis is relatively rare and often found in protected or undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
