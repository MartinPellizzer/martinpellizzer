The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with limited water availability.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
