                    <h1>Polystichum × saltum</h1>
<p>Polystichum × saltum, commonly known as the hybrid winter fern, is a hardy evergreen fern native to the United States.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Polystichum acrostichum and Polystichum milleflorum, resulting in a plant with distinctive fronds. The foliage is dark green and leathery, with a compact, upright growth habit that makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It thrives in shady, moist conditions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience.</p>
<p>The plant's spores are released from the sori located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its propagation in natural habitats.</p>
