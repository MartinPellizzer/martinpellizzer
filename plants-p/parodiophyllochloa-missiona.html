<p>Parodiophyllochloa missiona, commonly known as the Mission grass, is a rare grass species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
