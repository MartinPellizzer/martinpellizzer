                    <h1>Poa nemoralis var. uniflora</h1>
<p>Poa nemoralis var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered wood sedge, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>The variety uniflora is distinguished by its single flower per spikelet, setting it apart from other variants of Poa nemoralis.</p>
