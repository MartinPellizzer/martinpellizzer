<p>Prosopis farcta var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by flat, woody pods containing edible seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its role in desert ecosystems and has been used by indigenous peoples for food, medicine, and construction.</p>
