<p>Polystichum pseudoacutidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing fiddleheads in the spring, which are tightly coiled and resemble small, green spirals. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Polystichum pseudoacutidens thrives in woodland habitats and is often found growing on rocky or wooded slopes.</p>
