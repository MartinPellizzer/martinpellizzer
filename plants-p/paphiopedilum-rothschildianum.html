                    <h1>Paphiopedilum rothschildianum</h1>
<p>Paphiopedilum rothschildianum, commonly known as the Rothschild's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, a feature common among slipper orchids. The plant typically produces showy, dark purple or violet flowers with intricate patterns and a strong, spicy fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat loss, it is listed as endangered and is highly sought after in the horticultural trade.</p>
