<p>Potentilla effusa, commonly known as silverweed, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, helping it to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in rocky or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Potentilla effusa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and astringent properties.</p>
