<p>Polypodium armatum, commonly known as the cliff brake, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often used as a natural roofing material. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soil. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>Polypodium armatum is an important component of forest ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability.</p>
