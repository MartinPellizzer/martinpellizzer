<p>Pinguicula scopulorum, commonly known as the rock butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to rocky habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant typically grows in crevices or on rock surfaces, where it can absorb moisture from the air. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of pink or purple.</p>
<p>Pinguicula scopulorum is adapted to nutrient-poor environments, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients.</p>
