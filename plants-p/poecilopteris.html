                    <h1>Poecilopteris</h1>
<p>Poecilopteris, commonly known as the "sail fern," is a genus of fossilized ferns that thrived during the Carboniferous and Permian periods.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their large, complex fronds with a distinctive, sail-like appearance. They are often found in coal deposits, indicating their prevalence in ancient swampy environments. Poecilopteris species typically have a well-developed rhizome and produce sporangia on the underside of their fronds.</p>
<p>Their study provides valuable insights into the evolution of ferns and the paleobotanical history of Earth.</p>
