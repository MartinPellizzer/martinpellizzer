<p>Pinus nigra var. pallasiana, commonly known as the Pallas's pine, is a subspecies of the black pine native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 centimeters long. The plant produces cones that range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>This resilient evergreen is valued for its ecological role and historical use in timber and charcoal production.</p>
