                    <h1>Praealstonia theiformis</h1>
<p>Praealstonia theiformis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It lacks leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to cling to tree bark. The plant produces delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom once a year, making it a rare sight in the wild. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial due to its endangered status and limited natural range.</p>
