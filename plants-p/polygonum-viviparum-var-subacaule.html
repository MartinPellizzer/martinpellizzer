                    <h1>Polygonum viviparum var. subacaule</h1>
<p>Polygonum viviparum var. subacaule, commonly known as the creeping knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture and prominent veins. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance.</p>
<p>This plant is adapted to moist environments and can thrive in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats.</p>
