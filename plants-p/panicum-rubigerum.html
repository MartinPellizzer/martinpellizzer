                    <h1>Panicum rubigerum</h1>
<p>Panicum rubigerum, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple hues. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common weed in agricultural fields and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to tolerate drought, it is often used for erosion control and as a forage crop.</p>
