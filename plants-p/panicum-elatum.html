                    <h1>Panicum elatum</h1>
<p>Panicum elatum, commonly known as tall panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the warmer regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy seeds that are wind-dispersed, aiding in its spread across open fields and disturbed soils. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it a common sight in prairies and grasslands.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, contributing to its ecological significance in certain habitats.</p>
