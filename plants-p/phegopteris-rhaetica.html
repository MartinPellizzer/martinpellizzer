<p>Phegopteris rhaetica, commonly known as the Rhaetic fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or pendant, with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Phegopteris rhaetica is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful foliage.</p>
