<p>Plagiogyria pseudojaponica, commonly known as the Japanese rock fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and small, delicate fronds that are often submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant typically grows in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands, where it forms dense mats on the substrate. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Plagiogyria pseudojaponica plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
