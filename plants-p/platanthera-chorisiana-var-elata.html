<p>Platanthera chorisiana var. elata, commonly known as the tall lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-purple flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic woodlands and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this species is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
