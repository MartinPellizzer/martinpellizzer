                    <h1>Portulaca gilliesii var. pedicellata</h1>
<p>Portulaca gilliesii var. pedicellata, commonly known as the pink moss rose, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with red or purple, and its leaves are small, rounded, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a characteristic known as nyctinasty. Its ability to store water in its stems and leaves makes it highly drought-tolerant, adapting well to hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in xeriscaping for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements.</p>
