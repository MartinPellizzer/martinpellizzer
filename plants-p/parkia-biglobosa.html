                    <h1>Parkia biglobosa</h1>
<p>Parkia biglobosa, commonly known as the African locust bean tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnately arranged, and its distinctive yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces large, pod-like fruits that contain several edible seeds surrounded by a fibrous pulp. These seeds are rich in protein and oil, making them an important food source in many regions.</p>
<p>Additionally, the tree has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and contributes to soil fertility through nitrogen fixation.</p>
