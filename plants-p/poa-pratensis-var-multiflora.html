<p>Poa pratensis var. multiflora, commonly known as the Meadow Fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green blades that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which contribute to its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in lawn grass mixtures due to its drought tolerance and fine texture.</p>
<p>This variety is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in natural habitats.</p>
