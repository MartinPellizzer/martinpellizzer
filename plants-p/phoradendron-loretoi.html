                    <h1>Phoradendron loretoi</h1>
<p>Phoradendron loretoi, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Caribbean, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, often leading to the weakening or death of the host tree over time.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and ecological impact, it plays a significant role in the biodiversity of tropical forests.</p>
