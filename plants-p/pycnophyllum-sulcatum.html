                    <h1>Pycnophyllum sulcatum</h1>
<p>Pycnophyllum sulcatum, commonly known as the zigzag mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in tropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves that are often arranged in a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. It relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
