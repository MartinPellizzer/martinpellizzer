<p>dipterocarpacea, commonly known as the Pakaraima rosewood, is a member of the Dipterocarpaceae family, native to the humid forests of northeastern South America. It is a tall, evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 40 meters, characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and smooth, greyish bark.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, with a glossy upper surface and a pale underside. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments, although it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting.</p>
