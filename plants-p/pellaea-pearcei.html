                    <h1>Pellaea pearcei</h1>
<p>Pellaea pearcei, commonly known as the pearce's rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, leathery, evergreen leaves that form dense, mat-like clusters. The plant produces spore-bearing leaves, or sporophylls, that are distinct from the vegetative fronds. Pellaea pearcei thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptation to harsh conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
