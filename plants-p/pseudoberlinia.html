<p>Pseudoberlinia, commonly known as the African tamarind, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant is often found in savanna and woodland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Pseudoberlinia species are known for their nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil.</p>
<p>The seeds are encased in hard, woody pods and are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of tannins.</p>
