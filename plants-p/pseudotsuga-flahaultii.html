                    <h1>Pseudotsuga flahaultii</h1>
<p>Pseudotsuga flahaultii, commonly known as the Flahault's hemlock, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Pseudotsuga, which includes other hemlock species, but it is distinct due to its unique morphological features. The plant is characterized by its conical shape, needle-like leaves, and small, spherical cones. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss and climate change, it is a subject of conservation interest.</p>
