<p>Pittosporum zollingerianum var. argentea, commonly known as silver pittosporum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that turns coppery-red in autumn, and its fragrant white flowers that appear in late spring. The leaves are glossy and have a silvery underside, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
<p>This variety is relatively low-maintenance and suitable for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray.</p>
