<p>Prunus × introrsa, commonly known as the double-flowered cherry, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Prunus serrula and Prunus lusitana.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, double flowers that bloom in early spring, often with a pink or white hue. The plant is a small to medium-sized deciduous shrub or tree, typically reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dark purple drupe that matures in late summer, though it is generally not edible.</p>
