<p>Pectis pimana, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant has gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in spring, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Pectis pimana is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can go dormant during extended droughts.</p>
