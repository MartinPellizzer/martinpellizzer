                    <h1>Paspalum vaginatum var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Paspalum vaginatum var. pubescens, commonly known as hairy flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive hairy texture on both the leaf blades and sheaths. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown florets. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats in its native habitat.</p>
