<p>Pedicularis przewalskii subsp.</p>
<p>australis, commonly known as the Tibetan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its spurred flowers and fleshy, often hairy leaves.</p>
<p>The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of host plants. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in the study of plant parasitism and alpine ecosystems.</p>
