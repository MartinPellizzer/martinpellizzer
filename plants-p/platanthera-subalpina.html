                    <h1>Platanthera subalpina</h1>
<p>Platanthera subalpina, commonly known as the alpine lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers arranged in a loose, truss-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows and forested slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in many regions.</p>
