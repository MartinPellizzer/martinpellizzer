                    <h1>Panax anomalus var. microphyllus</h1>
<p>Panax anomalus var. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved ginseng, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the ginseng genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact stature and small, glossy leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring, followed by red berries that contain the seeds. Native to specific regions of China, it thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and herbalists alike.</p>
