                    <h1>Pinus mughus var. obliqua</h1>
<p>Pinus mughus var. obliqua, commonly known as the Kashmir pine, is a rare variant of the Himalayan pine native to the higher altitudes of the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles and conical shape, which help it withstand harsh mountainous conditions. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Its wood is valued for its durability and is used in traditional construction and craftsmanship.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
