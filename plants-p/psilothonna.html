                    <h1>Psilothonna</h1>
<p>Psilothonna, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with intricate, lip-like structures that aid in pollination by insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Psilothonna is now classified as critically endangered.</p>
