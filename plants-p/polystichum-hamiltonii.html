                    <h1>Polystichum hamiltonii</h1>
<p>Polystichum hamiltonii, commonly known as Hamilton's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its erect, dark green fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients effectively.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
