                    <h1>Panicum depauperatum f. cryptostachys</h1>
<p>Panicum depauperatum f. cryptostachys, commonly known as the cryptostachys panic grass, is a compact, low-growing grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, dense clusters of pale green to brownish flowers. The plant is characterized by its reduced inflorescence, which is shorter and more compact compared to the typical form of Panicum depauperatum. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists for its ornamental and ecological value.</p>
