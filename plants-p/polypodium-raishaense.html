<p>Polypodium raishaense, commonly known as the Raisha fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green and divided into narrow segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
