<p>Polypleurum acuminatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged or floating. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the substrate in shallow waters. Its spores are released into the water, facilitating reproduction in suitable environments.</p>
<p>It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
