<p>Panicum drosocarpum, commonly known as the clustered panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture, and its flowering structures are often clustered at the tips of the stems.</p>
<p>This grass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
