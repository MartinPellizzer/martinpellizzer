                    <h1>Pleopeltis collinsii</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis collinsii, commonly known as the Collins' tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive root system that forms a dense, fibrous mat at the base, which helps anchor it to rocky or shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique combination of features makes it a striking and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat.</p>
