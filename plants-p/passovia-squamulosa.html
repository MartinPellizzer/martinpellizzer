                    <h1>Passovia squamulosa</h1>
<p>Passovia squamulosa, commonly known as the squamulose passovia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, where it has adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation and conservation.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, Passovia squamulosa is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection to ensure its survival.</p>
