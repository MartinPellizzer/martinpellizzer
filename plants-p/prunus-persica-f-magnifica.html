                    <h1>Prunus persica f. magnifica</h1>
<p>Prunus persica f. magnifica, commonly known as the Persian plum or royal plum, is a distinctive cultivar of the peach tree characterized by its large, showy flowers.</p>
<p>It is prized for its ornamental value, featuring clusters of white or pink blooms that appear before the leaves in early spring. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically growing to a height of 3 to 5 meters. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The fruit, while edible, is smaller and less sweet compared to typical peaches, making it more suitable for ornamental purposes than culinary use.</p>
