                    <h1>Passerina rigida var. comosa</h1>
<p>Passerina rigida var. comosa, commonly known as the hairy pasqueflower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, fleshy stems and striking violet to pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine, stiff hairs that help reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions.</p>
<p>This species is also notable for its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat.</p>
