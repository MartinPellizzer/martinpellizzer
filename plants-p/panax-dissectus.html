                    <h1>Panax dissectus</h1>
<p>Panax dissectus, commonly known as the Chinese ginseng or the mountain ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, finely dissected leaves that resemble those of a fern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red berries containing seeds. Its roots are the primary part used in traditional medicine, valued for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
