<p>Poa arctica var. caespitans, commonly known as Arctic hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like clumps with fine, hair-like leaves that are often covered in a white bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its reproductive structures, including small spikelets, are typically found at the tips of the stems.</p>
