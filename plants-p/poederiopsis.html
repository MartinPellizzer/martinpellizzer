<p>Poederiopsis, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their low-growing, mat-forming habit and are often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The leaves are typically pinnately divided, and the flowers are small and clustered in umbels. Poederiopsis species are native to regions of southern Africa and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>They play a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
