<p>Platychaete glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky flatworm, is a species of flatworm found in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, flattened body and a gelatinous coating that gives it a sticky texture. The organism lacks a true digestive system and absorbs nutrients through its skin. It is typically found in slow-moving streams and ponds, where it feeds on small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to researchers studying aquatic ecosystems.</p>
