<p>Polypodium rhaeticum, commonly known as the Rhaetic fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and covered in small, rounded sori. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, the sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and contain the spores necessary for propagation.</p>
<p>Polypodium rhaeticum plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms.</p>
