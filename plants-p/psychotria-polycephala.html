<p>Psychotria polycephala, commonly known as the "Coca plant" or "Yareca," is a species of flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, opposite leaves, and small, white or pale yellow flowers. It produces small, red berries that contain the seeds, which are often used for propagation.</p>
<p>This plant is notable for its role in traditional medicine and its association with the coca plant, though it is distinct from the Erythroxylum species that contains cocaine.</p>
