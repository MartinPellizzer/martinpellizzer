                    <h1>Pellaea patula</h1>
<p>Pellaea patula, commonly known as the silver fir fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically gray-green in color due to a dense covering of trichomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Pellaea patula has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in humid, shaded areas.</p>
