<p>Poa triodioides, commonly known as the coastal tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in coastal dunes and sandy soils, where it forms dense mats that help stabilize the landscape. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greyish flowers, which are adapted to the harsh coastal environment.</p>
<p>Poa triodioides plays an important ecological role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for various coastal wildlife.</p>
