<p>Coralbean, scientifically known as Paraeremostachys anisochila, is a striking flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is prized for its vibrant, coral-pink to red blooms that appear in late spring to early summer. This perennial shrub thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners in warmer climates. Its unique appearance and adaptability have made it a favorite in both ornamental and ecological landscapes. Despite its beauty, it requires careful attention to avoid overwatering and potential pest issues.</p>
