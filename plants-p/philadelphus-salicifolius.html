<p>Philadelphus salicifolius, commonly known as the silver-leaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and heart-shaped, silver-white leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and hedges.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and showy blooms, though it can be invasive in some regions.</p>
