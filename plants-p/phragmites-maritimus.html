                    <h1>Phragmites maritimus</h1>
<p>Phragmites maritimus, commonly known as saltmarsh cordgrass, is a perennial grass that thrives in brackish or saline wetlands.</p>
<p>It has tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are wind-pollinated. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wetland species.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of salt marsh ecosystems.</p>
