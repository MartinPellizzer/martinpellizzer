<p>Pyrus montis-sinai, commonly known as the Sinai mountain pear, is a rare and endemic species native to the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt.</p>
<p>It is a small deciduous tree or shrub that typically grows in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, while its bark is thick and fissured.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
