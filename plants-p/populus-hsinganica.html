<p>Populus hsinganica, commonly known as the Hsingan poplar, is a species of poplar native to eastern Asia, particularly China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and heart-shaped leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and lowland areas.</p>
<p>The Hsingan poplar is valued for its fast growth and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts.</p>
