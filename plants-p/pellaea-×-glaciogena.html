                    <h1>Pellaea × glaciogena</h1>
<p>Pellaea × glaciogena, commonly known as the glacier fern, is a hybrid fern species native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are adapted to cold and rocky environments. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its leaves, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Pellaea × glaciogena is considered a rare and specialized plant.</p>
