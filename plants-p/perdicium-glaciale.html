                    <h1>Perdicium glaciale</h1>
<p>Perdicium glaciale, commonly known as the glacier lily, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the snow has fully melted. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to survive in cold, harsh environments with limited soil nutrients. Perdicium glaciale plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for early pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to climate change, it is considered a valuable indicator species for environmental monitoring.</p>
