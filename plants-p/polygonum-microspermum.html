                    <h1>Polygonum microspermum</h1>
<p>Polygonum microspermum, commonly known as the small-seeded knotweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, forming dense stands that can dominate wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>The small, dark seeds are dispersed by water and wind, contributing to its successful colonization of new areas.</p>
