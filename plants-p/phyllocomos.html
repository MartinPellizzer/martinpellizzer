<p>Phyllocomos, commonly known as the leafy moss, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the class Marchantiopsida.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or decaying wood. Its structure consists of a thallus, which is a leaf-like structure made up of a central axis and leaf-like lobes. Phyllocomos reproduces through spores, which are released from sporangia located on the underside of its lobes.</p>
<p>This plant plays a vital role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
