                    <h1>Pisonia cauliflora</h1>
<p>Pisonia cauliflora, commonly known as the coral tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique cauliflorous flowering habit, where flowers and fruits develop directly on the trunk and branches. The plant produces bright red or orange bracts that resemble coral, which are often mistaken for flowers. Its fruits are small, round, and fleshy, containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Pisonia cauliflora is adapted to coastal and humid environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems.</p>
