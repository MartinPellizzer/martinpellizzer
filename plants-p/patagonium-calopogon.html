<p>Patagonium calopogon, commonly known as the yellow adder's mouth, is a striking orchid species native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, yellow-orange flowers that resemble a serpent's mouth. The plant produces a single, elongated bloom with intricate, hooded petals and a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. It thrives in cool, humid environments at high altitudes, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
