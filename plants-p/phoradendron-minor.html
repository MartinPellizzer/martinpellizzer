                    <h1>Phoradendron minor</h1>
<p>Phoradendron minor, commonly known as the lesser mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the families Fabaceae and Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and minerals, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, contributing to the ecological dynamics of forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Phoradendron minor is found in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of the Americas and Southeast Asia.</p>
