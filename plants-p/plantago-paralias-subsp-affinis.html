<p>Plantago paralias subsp.</p>
<p>affinis, commonly known as the coastal plantain, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found along shorelines and dunes.</p>
<p>The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh coastal environments and its role in stabilizing dune ecosystems.</p>
