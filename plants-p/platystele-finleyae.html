                    <h1>Platystele finleyae</h1>
<p>Platystele finleyae, commonly known as the Finley's ghost plant, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial bromeliad that thrives in the shaded, humid understories of tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common feature among bromeliads. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically green or white, and it produces tiny, short-lived seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Platystele finleyae is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
