                    <h1>Parodia stuemeri var. tilcarensis</h1>
<p>Parodia stuemeri var. tilcarensis, commonly known as the Stuemer's pincushion cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a dense arrangement of white to pale green spines, giving it a pincushion-like appearance. The plant typically produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and slow growth rate, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
