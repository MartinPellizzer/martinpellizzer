                    <h1>Polypodium repens</h1>
<p>Polypodium repens, commonly known as the creeping polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground and form dense mats. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy through spore dispersal.</p>
