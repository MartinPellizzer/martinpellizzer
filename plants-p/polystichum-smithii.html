<p>Polystichum smithii, commonly known as Smith's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arched or curled when young. The plant produces spore-bearing fiddleheads in the spring, which unfurl into mature fronds throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Polystichum smithii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage.</p>
