                    <h1>Pteris pseudocretica</h1>
<p>Pteris pseudocretica, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that often have a wavy or curled appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, spongy layer that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which helps attract nocturnal pollinators.</p>
