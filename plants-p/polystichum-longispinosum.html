<p>Polystichum longispinosum, commonly known as the long-spined wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments with a distinctive, spiny appearance along the edges. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
