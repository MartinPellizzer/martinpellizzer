<p>Phyllopodium capillare, commonly known as the slender leaf fern, is a delicate, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures include small, spore-producing cones that are borne on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Phyllopodium capillare is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
