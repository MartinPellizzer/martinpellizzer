                    <h1>Piptospatha kinabaluensis</h1>
<p>Piptospatha kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu starling tree, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered inflorescences and small, yellowish flowers. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation to the high-altitude environment, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
