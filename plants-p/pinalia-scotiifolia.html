                <h1>Pinalia scotiifolia</h1>
<p>Pinalia scotiifolia, commonly known as the Scottish willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the British Isles.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and small, ovate leaves that are typically green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated, and it bears small, red berries in the autumn. Pinalia scotiifolia thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in temperate regions.</p>
