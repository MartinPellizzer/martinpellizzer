<p>Poa arvensis, commonly known as common bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile ground.</p>
<p>Poa arvensis is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.</p>
