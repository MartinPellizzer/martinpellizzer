                    <h1>Pyrostria serpentina</h1>
<p>Pyrostria serpentina, commonly known as the serpent's tail fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that resemble a serpent's tail, giving it its common name. The plant belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its unusual morphology and ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
