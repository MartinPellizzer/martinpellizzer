<p>Paspalum semialatum, commonly known as the silver paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from the fine, pubescent texture of its leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in dense panicles, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens and restoration projects.</p>
