                    <h1>Populus ceretana</h1>
<p>Populus ceretana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and heart-shaped leaves that are usually smaller than those of other poplar species. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common trait among members of the Populus genus. Its bark is smooth and grayish in color, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Populus ceretana is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in riparian zones.</p>
