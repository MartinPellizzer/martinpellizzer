<p>[WRONG START] Pleiosprios leipoldtii, commonly known as the Leopard's Ear, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that resemble the ears of a leopard, which store water to help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments.</p>
