                    <h1>Pinguicula oxyptera</h1>
<p>Pinguicula oxyptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wetlands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Pinguicula oxyptera is a low-growing plant that relies on insect prey for essential nutrients due to the lack of fertile soil in its habitat.</p>
