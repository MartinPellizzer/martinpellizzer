                    <h1>Pyrrosia heterophylla</h1>
<p>Pyrrosia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with fronds that can be either pinnate or digitate depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows on trees and rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the leaves, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Pyrrosia heterophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
