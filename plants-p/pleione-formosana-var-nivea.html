<p>Pleione formosana var. nivea, commonly known as the White Formosan Pleione, is a rare and elegant orchid native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has slender, erect pseudobulbs and linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade and requires well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
