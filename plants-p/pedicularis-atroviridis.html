                    <h1>Pedicularis atroviridis</h1>
<p>Pedicularis atroviridis, commonly known as the black viridian lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking dark green to blackish leaves and vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
