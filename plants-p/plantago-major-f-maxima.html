                    <h1>Plantago major f. maxima</h1>
<p>Plantago major f. maxima, commonly known as the broadleaf plantain, is a robust perennial herb characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained environments, making it a common sight in lawns, gardens, and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in spikes, which are followed by oval, nut-like seeds. Its extensive root system allows it to spread easily, often forming dense mats that can suppress other vegetation.</p>
<p>This species is known for its medicinal properties, with its leaves traditionally used to treat wounds and digestive issues.</p>
