                    <h1>Picea cephalonica</h1>
<p>Picea cephalonica, commonly known as the Cephalonic fir, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the mountainous regions of Greece.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces cone-shaped inflorescences that contain both male and female reproductive structures. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
