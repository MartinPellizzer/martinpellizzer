                    <h1>Prunus sachalinensis f. angustipetala</h1>
<p>Prunus sachalinensis f. angustipetala, commonly known as the narrow-petioled Japanese cherry, is a rare and ornamental shrub or small tree native to the Korean Peninsula and southern Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical species, with a distinctive petiole structure. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for garden cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation.</p>
