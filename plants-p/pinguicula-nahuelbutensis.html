<p>Pinguicula nahuelbutensis, commonly known as the Nahuelbutan butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Argentina.</p>
<p>It possesses small, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
