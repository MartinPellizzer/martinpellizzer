<p>Polypodium subpinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often resemble those of other ferns in the Huperziaceae family. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive, subpinnate pattern.</p>
