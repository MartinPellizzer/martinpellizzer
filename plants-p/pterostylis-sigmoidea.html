                    <h1>Pterostylis sigmoidea</h1>
<p>Pterostylis sigmoidea, commonly known as the zigzag ghost orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that resemble a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The species is relatively rare and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanical research.</p>
