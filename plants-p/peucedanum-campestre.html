                    <h1>Peucedanum campestre</h1>
<p>Peucedanum campestre, commonly known as field cowbane, is a biennial or perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, hollow stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbels, which are clustered in a flat-topped arrangement. Its seeds are enclosed in small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature.</p>
<p>Peucedanum campestre is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, and it has a long history of use in traditional medicine.</p>
