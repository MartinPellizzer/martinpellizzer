<p>Pajanelia multijuga, commonly known as the two-sided plant, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive bi-coloration, with green and white stripes on its leaves and stems. Native to the high-altitude regions of South America, it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
