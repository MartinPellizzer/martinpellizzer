                    <h1>Paraquilegia altimurana</h1>
<p>Paraquilegia altimurana, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often appearing in clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Paraquilegia altimurana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
