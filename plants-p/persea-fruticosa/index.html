                            <h1>Persea Fruticosa</h1>
<p>Persea fruticosa, also known as the wild avocado, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. This plant is characterized by its glossy dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. It produces small, edible fruits that are often overlooked despite their nutritional value. While not as widely cultivated as the common avocado, it holds cultural and ecological significance in its native regions. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a resilient species in diverse environments.</p>
