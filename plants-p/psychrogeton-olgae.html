<p>Psychrogeton olgae, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a flowering plant native to the extreme environments of Antarctica.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in the cold, arid conditions of the continent. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against harsh weather.</p>
<p>Psychrogeton olgae plays a vital role in the sparse vegetation of Antarctica, contributing to the region's unique ecological balance.</p>
