                    <h1>Phedimus crenatus</h1>
<p>Phedimus crenatus, commonly known as the silver carpet plant, is a low-growing perennial groundcover native to Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans and birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and shaded borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to spread and cover ground effectively.</p>
