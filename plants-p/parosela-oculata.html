                    <h1>Parosela oculata</h1>
<p>Parosela oculata, commonly known as the eye-leaf plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, waxy leaves that resemble eyes, which are a striking adaptation for attracting pollinators. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parosela oculata is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
