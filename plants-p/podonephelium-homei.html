                    <h1>Podonephelium homei</h1>
<p>Podonephelium homei, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of white or yellow flowers. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as the koa and ohia, through its haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in Hawaii.</p>
