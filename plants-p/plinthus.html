                    <h1>Plinthus</h1>
<p>Plinthus, commonly known as the "walking fern," is a unique species of fern that exhibits a peculiar growth habit.</p>
<p>It produces specialized stolons that can root at the nodes, allowing the plant to spread across the ground like a carpet. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forests. Its fronds are usually elongated and arching, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is classified as a member of the family Polypodiaceae, and it is known for its ability to form dense colonies over time.</p>
