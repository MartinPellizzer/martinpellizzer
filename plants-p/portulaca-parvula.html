<p>Portulaca parvula, commonly known as the dwarf moss rose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, succulent annual that thrives in hot, arid environments. The plant features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically bright red or pink, with five petals and a prominent central stigma.</p>
<p>Portulaca parvula is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
