                    <h1>Poa ursina</h1>
<p>Poa ursina, commonly known as the bear's grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the northern hemisphere and thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically green or reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a dense growth habit that helps it compete successfully in shaded areas.</p>
<p>Poa ursina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
