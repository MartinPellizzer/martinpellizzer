<p>Pleurothallis simpliciflora, commonly known as the simple-flowered pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, strap-like leaves and inconspicuous, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by small insects, and it produces small, round seed pods.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
