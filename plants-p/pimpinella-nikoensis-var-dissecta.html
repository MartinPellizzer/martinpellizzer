                    <h1>Pimpinella nikoensis var. dissecta</h1>
<p>Pimpinella nikoensis var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to specific regions in East Asia, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The variety 'dissecta' is distinguished by its highly lobed, almost lacy foliage, which sets it apart from other varieties of Pimpinella.</p>
