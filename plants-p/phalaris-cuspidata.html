                    <h1>Phalaris cuspidata</h1>
<p>Phalaris cuspidata, commonly known as sharpshooters' grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly pointed at the tips. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
