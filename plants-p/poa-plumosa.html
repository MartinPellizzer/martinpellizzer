                    <h1>Poa plumosa</h1>
<p>Poa plumosa, commonly known as the feathery bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, Poa plumosa is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
