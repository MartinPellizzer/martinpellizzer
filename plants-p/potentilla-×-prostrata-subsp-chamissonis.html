<p>Potentilla × prostrata subsp.</p>
<p>chamissonis, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to coastal regions of North America. It features small, oval to rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its frost-resistant nature.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of yellow, five-petaled flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its extensive root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control in sandy or coastal soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to saline and wind-swept environments, thriving in full sun to partial shade.</p>
