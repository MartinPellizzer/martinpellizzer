                    <h1>Phoradendron caracheanum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron caracheanum, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Caribbean, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically eaten by birds, which then disperse its seeds to new hosts. Its growth is dependent on the host tree for water and nutrients, while it provides some shelter and food for local wildlife.</p>
<p>This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
