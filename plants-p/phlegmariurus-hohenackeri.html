                    <h1>Phlegmariurus hohenackeri</h1>
<p>Phlegmariurus hohenackeri, commonly known as the Hohenacker's clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a sporophyte that develops into a spore-bearing structure called a strobilus. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky soils. Its reproductive structures are clustered at the tips of its stems, and it produces spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Phlegmariurus hohenackeri is a relatively rare and ancient plant, reflecting the evolutionary history of early land plants.</p>
