<p>Phyllobryon, commonly known as the leaf liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the order Marchantiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, lobed thallus that resembles a leaf, hence its common name. Phyllobryon typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its structure lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of a simple, undifferentiated body.</p>
<p>The plant reproduces via spores, which are produced in specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
