<p>Polypodium incanum var. fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often adorned with fine, fringed margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its unique fringing along the leaf edges, which gives it its common name.</p>
