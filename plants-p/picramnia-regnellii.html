<p>Picramnia regnellii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. It is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and carving.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as an endangered species.</p>
