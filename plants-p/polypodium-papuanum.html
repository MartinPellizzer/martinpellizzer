<p>Polypodium papuanum, commonly known as the Papuan holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Papua and nearby islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are often divided into feather-like segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and they play a key role in its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Polypodium papuanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>
