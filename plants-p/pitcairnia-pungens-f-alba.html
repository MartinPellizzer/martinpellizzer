                    <h1>Pitcairnia pungens f. alba</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia pungens f. alba, commonly known as the White Pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright rosette of narrow, waxy, white to pale green leaves that form a cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces showy, long-lasting inflorescences with white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in outdoor gardens in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
