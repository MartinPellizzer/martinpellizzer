                    <h1>Phoradendron californicum f. nanum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron californicum f. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in California.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using its small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. It forms dense clusters on the host branches, often leading to the formation of characteristic "mistletoe balls.".</p>
<p>This species is an important part of the ecosystem, supporting a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects.</p>
