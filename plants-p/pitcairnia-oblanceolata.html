                    <h1>Pitcairnia oblanceolata</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia oblanceolata, commonly known as the pink pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking pinkish-red bracts that surround the flowering spike, which can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant forms a dense rosette of long, narrow, leathery leaves that store water, adapting to its natural habitat in humid, shaded environments. It produces small, white, tubular flowers that are clustered along the central stem.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a warm, humid indoor setting.</p>
