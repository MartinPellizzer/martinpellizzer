                    <h1>Panax conchifolius</h1>
<p>Panax conchifolius, commonly known as the Brazilian ginseng, is a perennial plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, broad, wavy-lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries containing the seeds. Its roots are the primary part used in traditional medicine, valued for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
