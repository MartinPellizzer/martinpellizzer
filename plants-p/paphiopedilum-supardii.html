<p>Paphiopedilum supardii, commonly known as the Sichuan lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, intricate flowers with a pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, a feature typical of the genus Paphiopedilum. The plant produces showy, fragrant blooms in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with contrasting patterns. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Paphiopedilum supardii is considered an endangered species.</p>
