The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces distinctive, spurred petals that are adapted to attract specific pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
