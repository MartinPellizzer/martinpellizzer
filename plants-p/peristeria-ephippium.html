                    <h1>Peristeria ephippium</h1>
<p>Peristeria ephippium, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has a unique structure, with a colorful "upper" part that is actually a grafted variety of the Hylocereus genus, while the lower part is the Peristeria ephippium itself. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse environments.</p>
