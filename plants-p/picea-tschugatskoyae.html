                    <h1>Picea tschugatskoyae</h1>
<p>Picea tschugatskoyae, commonly known as the Tschugatskoye fir, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles and compact, pyramidal shape. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil, typically at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is critically important for conservation efforts.</p>
