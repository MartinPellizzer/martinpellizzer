<p>Pilosocereus flavipulvinatus var. carolinensis, commonly known as the Carolina night bloomer, is a cacti species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus with thick, ribbed stems that store water, typical of its arid habitat. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers at night, which open in response to warmth and light. Its foliage is covered in dense, white to grayish hairs, providing insulation and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
