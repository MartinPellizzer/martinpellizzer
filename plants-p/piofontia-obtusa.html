<p>Piofontia obtusa, commonly known as the broadleaf piofontia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and a prominent central stamen. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it forms dense, low-growing mats.</p>
