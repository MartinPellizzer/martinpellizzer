<p>Phreatia papuana, commonly known as the Papuan ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Papua and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches in the rainforest canopy. The plant produces striking, pale green to white flowers with a unique, almost translucent appearance. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
