                    <h1>Pedicularis sulphurea</h1>
<p>Pedicularis sulphurea, commonly known as the golden monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>This herbaceous plant is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers, which resemble the fur of a monkey, hence its common name. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, which involves attracting specific insects with its vivid coloration and aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
