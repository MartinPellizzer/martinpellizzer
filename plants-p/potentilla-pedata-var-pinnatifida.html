                    <h1>Potentilla pedata var. pinnatifida</h1>
<p>Potentilla pedata var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnatifid leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
