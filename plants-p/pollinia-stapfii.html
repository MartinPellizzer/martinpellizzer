                    <h1>Pollinia stapfii</h1>
<p>Pollinia stapfii, commonly known as the Stapf's orchid, is a unique orchid species characterized by its specialized pollination structures.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to specific regions in Africa, particularly in Kenya and Tanzania. The plant features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs and linear leaves. Its most distinctive botanical feature is the presence of pollinia, which are compact masses of pollen grains held together by a viscid matrix.</p>
<p>These pollinia are adapted for epiphytic growth and are essential for the plant's reproductive strategy.</p>
