                    <h1>Pernettya microphylla</h1>
<p>Pernettya microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the cool, moist forests of northern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length, giving it a dense, moss-like appearance. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, edible berries that ripen to a deep red or black color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments.</p>
<p>Pernettya microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact growth and seasonal interest.</p>
