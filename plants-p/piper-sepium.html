                    <h1>Piper sepium</h1>
<p>Piper sepium, commonly known as the Indian pepper vine, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper plants, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces tiny, berry-like fruits that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Its aerial roots help it cling to supports as it climbs, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and valuable in ethnobotanical practices.</p>
