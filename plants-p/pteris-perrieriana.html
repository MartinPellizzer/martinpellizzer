<p>Pteris perrieriana, commonly known as the Perrier's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint glow in the dark. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately divided with serrated margins, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
