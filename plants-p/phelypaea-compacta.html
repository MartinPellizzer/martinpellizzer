<p>Phelypaea compacta, commonly known as the compact water clover, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it can anchor itself to muddy substrates. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Phelypaea compacta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
