                    <h1>Psammisia breviflora</h1>
<p>Psammisia breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions through its succulent leaves and deep root system. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its structure is characterized by a mat-forming habit, which helps it stabilize loose sand and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Psammisia breviflora plays an important ecological role in desert ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>
