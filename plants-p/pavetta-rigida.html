                    <h1>Pavetta rigida</h1>
<p>Pavetta rigida, commonly known as rigid pavetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, elliptic leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in natural habitats.</p>
<p>Pavetta rigida is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
