                    <h1>Pleuropteropyrum weyrichii var. alpinum</h1>
<p>Pleuropteropyrum weyrichii var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine pleuropteropyrum, is a rare and specialized plant species found in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions. Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to cold, wind-exposed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
