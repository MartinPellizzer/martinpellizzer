<p>Pediocactus winkleri, commonly known as the Winkler's barrel cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert of the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus with a short, thick stem that often branches into a spherical shape as it matures. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the top of the stems. Its spines are relatively short and dense, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Pediocactus winkleri is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stem and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture from infrequent rains.</p>
