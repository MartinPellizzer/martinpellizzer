                    <h1>Piptocarpha macropoda var. acutifolia</h1>
<p>Piptocarpha macropoda var. acutifolia, commonly known as the sharpleaf goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with upright, branching stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and sharply pointed, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
