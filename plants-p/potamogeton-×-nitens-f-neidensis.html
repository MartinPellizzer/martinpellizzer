                    <h1>Potamogeton × nitens f. neidensis</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × nitens f. neidensis, commonly known as the Neidens' pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically submerged in freshwater environments. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which emerge from the water surface. It is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its hybrid origin contributes to its genetic diversity and adaptability in various aquatic habitats.</p>
