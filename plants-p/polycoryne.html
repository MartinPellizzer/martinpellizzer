                    <h1>Polycoryne</h1>
<p>Polycoryne, commonly known as the fairy polypore, is a type of bracket fungus that belongs to the family Polycystidiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped or shield-like caps that are usually pale yellow to brown in color. The fruiting bodies typically grow on dead wood, especially hardwoods, and are often found in forested areas. The spore-bearing surface is smooth and lacks a distinct stem, which is a key identifying feature.</p>
<p>Polycoryne species are generally saprophytic, decomposing wood through the breakdown of lignin and cellulose.</p>
