<p>Phleum pratense subsp.</p>
<p>vulgare, commonly known as timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>The plant features tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it a common component of grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Timothy grass is also valued as a forage crop for livestock due to its nutritional content and palatability.</p>
