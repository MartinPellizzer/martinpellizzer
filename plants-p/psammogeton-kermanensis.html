<p>Psammogeton kermanensis, commonly known as the Kerman sand-plant, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, green, sand-adapted leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological niche, it is of interest in studies related to xerophytic plant adaptations.</p>
