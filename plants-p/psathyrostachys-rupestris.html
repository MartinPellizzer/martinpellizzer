<p>Psathyrostachys rupestris, commonly known as the rock bamboo, is a perennial grass species native to arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh, rocky environments with low water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
