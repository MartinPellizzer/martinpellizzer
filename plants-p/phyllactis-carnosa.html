<p>Phyllactis carnosa, commonly known as the woolly phyllactis, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Phyllactis carnosa is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
