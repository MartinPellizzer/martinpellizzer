                    <h1>Parodia microsperma var. argerichiana</h1>
<p>Parodia microsperma var. argerichiana, commonly known as the Argentino Cactus, is a compact, spherical cactus native to Argentina.</p>
<p>It features a dense covering of white to pale blue spines, which help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant has a short, thick stem with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, opening in the morning and closing by midday.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
