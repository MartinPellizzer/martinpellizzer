<p>Pseudognaphalium leucopeplum, commonly known as the silverleaf goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun conditions.</p>
