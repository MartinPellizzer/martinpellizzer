                    <h1>Panisea pantlingii</h1>
<p>Panisea pantlingii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its slender, pale green stems and striking, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
