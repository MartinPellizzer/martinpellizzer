                    <h1>Ponthieva appendiculata</h1>
<p>Ponthieva appendiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It features slender, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted for aquatic environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in marshy areas.</p>
<p>Ponthieva appendiculata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and support aquatic life.</p>
