<p>Pleurothallis juninensis var. subaequisepala, commonly known as the Jun√≠n pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the Andean highlands of Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with white to pale yellow petals and sepals, often adorned with subtle markings. This variety is distinguished by its subequal sepals, which contribute to its specific epithet.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
