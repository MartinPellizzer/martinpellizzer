                    <h1>Poa trivialis f. balearica</h1>
<p>Poa trivialis f. balearica, commonly known as the Balearic meadow grass, is a botanical variant of the common bentgrass.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, perennial grass that typically forms dense mats on moist, nutrient-rich soils. This subspecies is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a pioneer species in soil stabilization and as a food source for various herbivores.</p>
