                    <h1>Pellaea pinnata</h1>
<p>Pellaea pinnata, commonly known as the basket fern, is a species of fern native to the southern United States and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, frond-like leaves that resemble a basket, hence its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sorus on the undersides of its fronds. Pellaea pinnata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in botanical studies and horticulture.</p>
