<p>Paramicropholis acutangula, commonly known as the sharp-pointed fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a thin layer of fine hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Paramicropholis acutangula make it a unique and interesting subject for study in tropical botany.</p>
