                    <h1>Poa nemoralis var. pallida</h1>
<p>Poa nemoralis var. pallida, commonly known as the pale wood sedge, is a variant of the wood sedge species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks, often forming dense, low-growing clumps. Its pale green to bluish-gray foliage distinguishes it from other Poa species, and it is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora.</p>
<p>The pale wood sedge plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
