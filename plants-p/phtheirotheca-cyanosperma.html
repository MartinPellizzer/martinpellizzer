<p>Phtheirotheca cyanosperma, commonly known as the blue-spored cup lichen, is a member of the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus with a distinctive blueish discoloration in the apothecia. The species is typically found on tree bark in temperate and boreal forests, where it thrives in humid environments. Its reproductive structures, called apothecia, produce spores that are blue in color, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
