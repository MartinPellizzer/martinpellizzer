                    <h1>Parthenocissus heterophylla</h1>
<p>Parthenocissus heterophylla, commonly known as the variable ivy, is a species of climbing vine native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be either palmately lobed or trifoliate depending on the environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its tendrils allow it to climb and spread along walls, trees, and other structures.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
