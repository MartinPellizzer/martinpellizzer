                    <h1>Plantago xerodea</h1>
<p>Plantago xerodea, commonly known as the desert plantain, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion in harsh environments.</p>
