<p>Paraprasophyllum hygrophilum, commonly known as the water-loving lichen, is a unique organism that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is a lichen, a composite organism formed by a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This species is often found on rocks or tree bark in humid regions, where it can absorb moisture effectively. Its structure consists of a dense, crust-like thallus that helps it retain water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered an indicator species for certain ecological conditions.</p>
