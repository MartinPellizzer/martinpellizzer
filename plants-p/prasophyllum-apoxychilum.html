<p>Prasophyllum apoxychilum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved greenhood, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, greenish-brown flower that resembles a hood, typical of the orchid genus Prasophyllum. The plant is adapted to grow in heathland and woodland habitats, often in well-drained soils. It produces a small, fleshy seed capsule that disperses seeds via wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
