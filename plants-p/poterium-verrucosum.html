<p>Poterium verrucosum, commonly known as the rough marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in small, wart-like bumps, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
