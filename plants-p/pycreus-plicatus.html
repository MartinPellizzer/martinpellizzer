                    <h1>Pycreus plicatus</h1>
<p>Pycreus plicatus, commonly known as the pleated fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, pleated fronds that give it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which helps in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant's reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
