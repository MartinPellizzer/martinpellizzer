                    <h1>Peperomia epipetrica</h1>
<p>Peperomia epipetrica, commonly known as the rock peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to rocky habitats in South America.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to anchor itself in crevices and nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Peperomia epipetrica is well adapted to dry conditions, making it a popular choice for succulent and rock garden displays.</p>
