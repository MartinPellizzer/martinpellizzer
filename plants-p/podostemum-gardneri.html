                    <h1>Podostemum gardneri</h1>
<p>Podostemum gardneri, commonly known as the African water primrose, is a unique aquatic plant found in fast-flowing streams and rivers across sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, with a broad, flat structure that helps it remain buoyant in turbulent waters. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are often submerged or partially submerged, adapting to its aquatic environment. Its roots are specialized for anchoring in rocky substrates, and it plays an important role in stabilizing riverbanks.</p>
<p>Podostemum gardneri is also an important food source for various aquatic invertebrates and fish species.</p>
