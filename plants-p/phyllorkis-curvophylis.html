                    <h1>Phyllorkis curvophylis</h1>
<p>Phyllorkis curvophylis, commonly known as the curled-leaf liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, lobed thallus that often forms dense mats on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a flat, leaf-like structure called a thallus. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sorocarps.</p>
<p>Phyllorkis curvophylis is typically found in humid environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool and damp conditions.</p>
