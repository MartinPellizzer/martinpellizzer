                    <h1>Pseudoraphis sordida</h1>
<p>Pseudoraphis sordida, commonly known as the desert candle, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, gray-green leaves that are arranged in a cylindrical shape, giving it a candle-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by distinctive red, spiny fruits that contain seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
