                    <h1>Pycreus capillifolius var. major</h1>
<p>Pycreus capillifolius var. major, commonly known as the giant hairleaf tamarisk, is a shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, woody stems covered in fine, hair-like leaves that reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or pale purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or saline soils.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
