<p>Pteris pedata var. hederacea, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed shield fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a compact, low-growing fern that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in shaded, moist environments. The plant features rhombic to ovate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, shield-like appearance, and its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid conditions and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in shaded garden areas.</p>
<p>The varietal form, hederacea, is distinguished by its broader fronds compared to the typical species.</p>
