                    <h1>Picea commutata</h1>
<p>Picea commutata, commonly known as the subalpine fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more rigid than those of other fir species. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across high-elevation habitats. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations above 6,000 feet.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it plays a key role in maintaining biodiversity in alpine ecosystems.</p>
