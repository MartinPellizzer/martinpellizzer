<p>Polystichum heterodon, commonly known as the heterodon fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, giving the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
