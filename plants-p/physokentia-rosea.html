                    <h1>Physokentia rosea</h1>
<p>Physokentia rosea, commonly known as the rose-tipped cycad, is a rare and striking member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Its cones are unique, with the female cones being pinkish in color, which is a rare trait among cycads.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is considered a conservation concern.</p>
