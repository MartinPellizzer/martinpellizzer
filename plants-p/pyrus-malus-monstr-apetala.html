<p>Pyrus malus monstr.</p>
<p>apetala, commonly known as the flowerless apple tree, is a rare and unusual variant of the apple tree characterized by its complete absence of flowers. This botanical anomaly results from a genetic mutation that suppresses floral development, leading to the absence of both male and female reproductive structures.</p>
<p>Despite lacking flowers, the plant retains all other typical features of the apple tree, including its leaves, bark, and fruiting capabilities. The fruit produced is often smaller and less flavorful compared to standard apple varieties.</p>
<p>This unique specimen is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its genetic and developmental peculiarities.</p>
