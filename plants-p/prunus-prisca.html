                    <h1>Prunus prisca</h1>
<p>Prunus prisca, commonly known as the ancient cherry, is a rare and extinct species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is believed to have originated in the Paleogene period, making it one of the oldest known cherry species. The plant is characterized by its small, oval leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruits, which were likely cherries, would have been edible and possibly used by early humans.</p>
<p>Due to its extinction, little is known about its full botanical structure and ecological role.</p>
