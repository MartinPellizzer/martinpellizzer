<p>Peltapteris peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian shield fern, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the order Psilophyta.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, branching structure and the presence of small, shield-like leaves. This fern-like plant thrived during the Carboniferous period, approximately 300 million years ago. Its fossils are often found in coal deposits, indicating its role in ancient forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant's morphology suggests it was adapted to swampy, low-light environments.</p>
