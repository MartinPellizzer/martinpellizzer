<p>Ptychosperma capitis-yorki, commonly known as the York Island palm, is a species of cycad native to the Torres Strait Islands in northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically green when immature and turn reddish-brown as they mature. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to saline and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
