                    <h1>Poa saruwagetica</h1>
<p>Poa saruwagetica, commonly known as the Saruwagetica grass, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat.</p>
<p>Poa saruwagetica is adapted to rocky and poorly drained soils, making it a resilient component of alpine vegetation.</p>
