<p>Pseudosempervivum amanum, commonly known as the silver carpet sedum, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
