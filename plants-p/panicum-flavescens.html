<p>Panicum flavescens, commonly known as yellow bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the warm temperate and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green spikelets that are often mistaken for grains, and it is well adapted to drought conditions. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it a valuable plant in restoration ecology.</p>
