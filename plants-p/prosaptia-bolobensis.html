                    <h1>Prosaptia bolobensis</h1>
<p>Prosaptia bolobensis, commonly known as the Bolob√© mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of western Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a waxy surface. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Prosaptia bolobensis is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
