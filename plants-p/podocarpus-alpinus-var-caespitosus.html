                    <h1>Podocarpus alpinus var. caespitosus</h1>
<p>Podocarpus alpinus var. caespitosus, commonly known as the Alpine podocarp or dwarf mountain pine, is a dense, evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It features compact, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, a characteristic typical of the Podocarpaceae family. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit makes it suitable for use in horticulture as a ornamental plant or for erosion control in suitable environments.</p>
