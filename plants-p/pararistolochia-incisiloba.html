<p>Pararistolochia incisiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leafed Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, deeply lobed leaves and distinctive, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially hazardous to animals and humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated, though caution is advised due to its poisonous properties.</p>
