                    <h1>Phoradendron guatemalense</h1>
<p>Phoradendron guatemalense, commonly known as the Guatemalan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. It is native to Central America, including parts of Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
