<p>Pseudopogonatherum irritans, commonly known as the irritant grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves contain irritant compounds that can cause skin inflammation in some individuals.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth and potential to invade disturbed areas, it is considered a weed in many parts of its range.</p>
