                    <h1>Picris filii</h1>
<p>Picris filii, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a hairy surface, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. It is often found growing in colonies due to its rhizomatous root system.</p>
<p>The plant is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
