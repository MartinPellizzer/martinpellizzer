<p>Pauridiantha setiflora, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, blue-green leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep taproots and reduced leaf surface area. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few days, and it relies on insect pollination.</p>
<p>Pauridiantha setiflora is an important component of desert ecosystems, providing food for various pollinators and small herbivores.</p>
