                    <h1>Paspalum oajacense</h1>
<p>Paspalum oajacense, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, coastal soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind, making it well-suited for dune stabilization. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Paspalum oajacense is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects.</p>
