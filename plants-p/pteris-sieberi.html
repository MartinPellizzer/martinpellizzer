                    <h1>Pteris sieberi</h1>
<p>Pteris sieberi, commonly known as the Sieber's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
