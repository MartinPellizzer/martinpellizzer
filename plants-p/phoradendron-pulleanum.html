                    <h1>Phoradendron pulleanum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron pulleanum, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native Hawaiian trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically visited by native bees and other pollinators. Its berries, which are bright red, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Phoradendron pulleanum is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
