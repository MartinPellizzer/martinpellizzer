<p>Polypodium stewartii, commonly known as the Stewart's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and form dense colonies, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
