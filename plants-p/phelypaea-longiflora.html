<p>Phelypaea longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, with small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. Its reproductive strategy involves the production of numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Phelypaea longiflora plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
