                    <h1>Prunus × lannesiana f. homogena</h1>
<p>Prunus × lannesiana f. homogena, commonly known as the double-flowered cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus genus characterized by its unique floral morphology.</p>
<p>This variety exhibits double blossoms, with multiple layers of petals that give it a more丰满 and showy appearance compared to single-flowered cherries. It is typically a deciduous shrub or small tree, reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth texture and a glossy green surface.</p>
<p>The fruit, when mature, is a small, dark red drupe, though it is usually not edible due to its tart flavor.</p>
