                    <h1>Protium meridionale</h1>
<p>Protium meridionale, commonly known as the Mexican mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central America and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by round, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a significant species in local economies.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in many regions.</p>
