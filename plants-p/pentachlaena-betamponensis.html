                    <h1>Pentachlaena betamponensis</h1>
<p>Pentachlaena betamponensis, commonly known as the Betampona fern, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often clustered in dense, compact rosettes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in humid forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its ability to anchor itself in rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
