                    <h1>Pedilonum rhaphiotes</h1>
<p>Pedilonum rhaphiotes, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
