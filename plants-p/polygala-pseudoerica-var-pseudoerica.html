<p>Polygala pseudoerica var. pseudoerica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, sparsely arranged leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers, which are often clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand drought and has a deep root system to access moisture.</p>
<p>The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
