<p>Phegopteris polycarpa, commonly known as the clustered maidenhair fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures are unique, with sporangia clustered in groups along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>The fern's intricate morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
