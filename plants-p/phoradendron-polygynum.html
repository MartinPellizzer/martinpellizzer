                    <h1>Phoradendron polygynum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron polygynum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using some retained chlorophyll. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers and red, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with both the host tree and its avian dispersers.</p>
<p>Phoradendron polygynum plays a significant ecological role in forest ecosystems, influencing host tree health and supporting biodiversity.</p>
