                    <h1>Platanthera dyeriana</h1>
<p>Platanthera dyeriana, commonly known as Dyer's lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and its long, spiraled inflorescence of pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
