                    <h1>Pyrola aphylla var. leptosepala</h1>
<p>Pyrola aphylla var. leptosepala, commonly known as the slender-sepaled wintergreen, is a rare and delicate evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, hairy stalks. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant relies on specific forest conditions for survival.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed, acidic forest ecosystems.</p>
