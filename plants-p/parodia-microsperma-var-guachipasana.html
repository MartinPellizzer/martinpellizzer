<p>Parodia microsperma var. guachipasana, commonly known as the Guachipasana cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the Andes Mountains of Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise muted appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
