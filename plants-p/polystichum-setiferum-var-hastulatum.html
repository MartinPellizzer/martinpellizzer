                    <h1>Polystichum setiferum var. hastulatum</h1>
<p>Polystichum setiferum var. hastulatum, commonly known as the Hart's Tongue fern, is a perennial fern native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are dark green and often have a metallic sheen. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its slow growth and ability to form dense, compact clumps over time.</p>
