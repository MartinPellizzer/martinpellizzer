The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. Its ornamental value is notable, though it is not widely cultivated due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
