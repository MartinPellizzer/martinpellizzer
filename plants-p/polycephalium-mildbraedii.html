                    <h1>Polycephalium mildbraedii</h1>
<p>Polycephalium mildbraedii, commonly known as the velvet mushroom, is a unique fungal species belonging to the family Phallaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, gelatinous cap that resembles a brain or a velvet texture, which is a key botanical feature. The fruiting body typically emerges from decaying organic matter, such as wood or soil, and has a short lifespan. Its spore-bearing structure, known as the gleba, is enclosed within the cap and is released through a stalk-like stem.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ecological role in nutrient cycling and its unusual morphology.</p>
