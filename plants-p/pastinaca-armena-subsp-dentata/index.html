                            <h1>Pastinaca Armena Subsp. Dentata</h1>
<p>Pastinaca armena subsp. dentata is a lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family known for its distinctive, serrated leaves and edible roots. Native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, this plant thrives in cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. Its name, derived from Latin, reflects its historical use in traditional medicine and culinary practices. Despite its potential, it remains underappreciated compared to more common root vegetables like carrots or parsnips. This article explores its botanical features, ecological significance, and possible future applications in agriculture and herbal medicine.</p>
