<p>Physurus platensis, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive arrowhead shape, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in wet or moist environments.</p>
<p>Physurus platensis is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in waterlogged soil.</p>
