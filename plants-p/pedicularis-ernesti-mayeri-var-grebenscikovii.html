<p>Pedicularis ernesti-mayeri var. grebenscikovii, commonly known as the Grebenskikov's lousewort, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
