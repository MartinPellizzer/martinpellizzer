<p>Podandrogyne orba, commonly known as the red-flowered sand mat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces both male and female flowers on the same individual, a trait known as andromonoecy. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The showy red or pink flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
