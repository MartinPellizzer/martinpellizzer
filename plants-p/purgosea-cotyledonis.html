                    <h1>Purgosea cotyledonis</h1>
<p>Purgosea cotyledonis, commonly known as the coastal sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the sandy coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy, green leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, helping to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Purgosea cotyledonis is well-suited to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds.</p>
