<p>Podocarpus ekmanii, commonly known as the dwarf podocarp, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive appearance.</p>
<p>Podocarpus ekmanii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
