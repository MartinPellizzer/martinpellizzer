                    <h1>Poa haenkei</h1>
<p>Poa haenkei, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the cold regions of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silky leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are adapted to the short growing seasons of its habitat. Poa haenkei is often found in rocky soils and on mountain slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to extreme climatic conditions.</p>
