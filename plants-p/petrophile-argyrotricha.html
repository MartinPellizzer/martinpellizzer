                    <h1>Petrophile argyrotricha</h1>
<p>Petrophile argyrotricha, commonly known as silver-haired rock-heath, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Epacridaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in heathlands or on sandstone outcrops. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a silvery or pale waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid or semi-arid habitat.</p>
<p>Petrophile argyrotricha is adapted to low-nutrient environments and is often found in coastal or inland regions with well-drained soils.</p>
