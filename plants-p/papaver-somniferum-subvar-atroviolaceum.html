                    <h1>Papaver somniferum subvar. atroviolaceum</h1>
<p>Papaver somniferum subvar. atroviolaceum, commonly known as the dark violet opium poppy, is a variant of the opium poppy characterized by its deep violet to almost black petals.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of Central Asia and has been cultivated for its latex, which contains alkaloids such as morphine and codeine. The plant typically grows to a height of 1â€“2 meters and produces striking flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features include a hairy stem, alternate leaves, and a capsule-like fruit that splits open to release the seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its association with opiate production, it is subject to strict legal regulation in many countries.</p>
