<p>Polypodium cretatum, commonly known as the Cretaceous fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green and have a soft, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Polypodium cretatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions.</p>
