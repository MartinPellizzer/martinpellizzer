                            <h1>Potentilla Pensylvanica Var. Nudicaulis</h1>
<p>Potentilla pensylvanica var. nudicaulis is a unique and resilient plant native to the rocky habitats of the northeastern United States. It is known for its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. This variety is distinguished by its bare, leafless stems, which give it its name "nudicaulis." Despite its small size, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
