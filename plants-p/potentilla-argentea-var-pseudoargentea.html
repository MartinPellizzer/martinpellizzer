                    <h1>Potentilla argentea var. pseudoargentea</h1>
<p>Potentilla argentea var. pseudoargentea, commonly known as silver potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates.</p>
