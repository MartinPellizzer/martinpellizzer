                    <h1>Pitcairnia roseoalba</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia roseoalba, commonly known as the pink-flowered pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common adaptation among bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant pink or red inflorescences that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which may serve to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia roseoalba thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
