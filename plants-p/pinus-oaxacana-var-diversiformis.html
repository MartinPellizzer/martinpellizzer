                    <h1>Pinus oaxacana var. diversiformis</h1>
<p>Pinus oaxacana var. diversiformis, commonly known as the Oaxacan pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which includes both needles and scale-like leaves, a feature that sets it apart from most other pine species. The tree typically grows in high-altitude forests, where it thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. Its cones are small and often hang in clusters, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
