<p>Parathelypteris glanduligera var. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent water fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in high humidity. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new shoots along their length. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, glandular dots on the undersides that contribute to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its soft, hairy texture, which distinguishes it from other members of the genus.</p>
