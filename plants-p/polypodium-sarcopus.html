<p>Polypodium sarcopus, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocks or trees, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous structure with fronds that are pinnately compound, featuring a serrated or lobed margin. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>Polypodium sarcopus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
