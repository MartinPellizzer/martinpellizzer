<p>Phaca magellensis, commonly known as the Magellanic lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in cool, humid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, flat layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive, granular texture. It is widely distributed in the Southern Hemisphere, particularly in South America and New Zealand.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to pollution and climate changes.</p>
