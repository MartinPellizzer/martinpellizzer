<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing white or pale pink flowers that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.
