<p>Pilosella schultesii subsp.</p>
<p>tricoronaemontis, commonly known as the alpine pearly everlasting, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in harsh environments, and its flowers are visited by various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
