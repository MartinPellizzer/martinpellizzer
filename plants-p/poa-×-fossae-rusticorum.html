                    <h1>Poa × fossae-rusticorum</h1>
<p>Poa × fossae-rusticorum, commonly known as the hybrid meadowgrass, is a sterile, naturally occurring hybrid between Poa annua and Poa trivialis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are similar to those of its parent species. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically cultivated for agricultural or ornamental purposes.</p>
