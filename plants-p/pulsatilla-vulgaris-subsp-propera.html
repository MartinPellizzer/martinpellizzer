<p>Pulsatilla vulgaris subsp.</p>
<p>propera, commonly known as the meadow anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flower heads that resemble a crown of anemones.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies.</p>
