<p>Piptatherum mexicanum, commonly known as Mexican needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps it conserve water in arid environments.</p>
<p>Piptatherum mexicanum is adapted to withstand drought and is often found in disturbed or marginal soils.</p>
