<p>Polypodium detergibile, commonly known as the black huperzia, is a fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of spores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients.</p>
