<p>Phaiophleps biflora subsp.</p>
<p>lyckholmii, commonly known as the Lyckholm's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling ghostly apparitions in the dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture humidity in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
