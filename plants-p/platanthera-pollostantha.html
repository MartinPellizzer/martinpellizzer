<p>Platanthera pollostantha, commonly known as the Florida lady's-tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fragrant, white to pale yellow flower spikes that resemble a tresses of hair. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and swamps, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
