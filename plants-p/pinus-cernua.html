                    <h1>Pinus cernua</h1>
<p>Pinus cernua, commonly known as the creeping pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit, with dense clusters of needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 inches long. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its root system is highly adaptable, allowing it to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Pinus cernua plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
