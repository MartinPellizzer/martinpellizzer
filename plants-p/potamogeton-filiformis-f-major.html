<p>Potamogeton filiformis f. major, commonly known as the broad-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It features long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically wider than those of the typical form, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like structures, which are often submerged or just below the water surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>This species is often found in slow-moving or still waters, such as lakes and ponds.</p>
