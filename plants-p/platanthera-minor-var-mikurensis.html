                    <h1>Platanthera minor var. mikurensis</h1>
<p>Platanthera minor var. mikurensis, commonly known as the Mikura Island twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or along stream banks. It has a short rhizome and relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
