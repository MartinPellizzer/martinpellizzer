                    <h1>Poa saxicola</h1>
<p>Poa saxicola, commonly known as the rock grass or mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to alpine and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in high-altitude regions, where it forms dense, low-growing mats to withstand harsh weather conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to poor soil conditions and can thrive in areas with limited nutrients.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil in rocky terrains and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
