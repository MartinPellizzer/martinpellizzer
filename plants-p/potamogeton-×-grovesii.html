                    <h1>Potamogeton × grovesii</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × grovesii, commonly known as the hybrid water milfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Potamogeton perfoliatus and Potamogeton crispus.</p>
<p>It typically grows in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers, where it forms dense underwater vegetation. The plant has whorled leaves that are often ribbed and can be either smooth or serrated, depending on the environmental conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing in late summer, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it can exhibit genetic variability, making it a subject of interest in botanical and ecological studies.</p>
