                    <h1>Phacelia scariosa</h1>
<p>Phacelia scariosa, commonly known as the desert phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, where it has adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Phacelia scariosa plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
