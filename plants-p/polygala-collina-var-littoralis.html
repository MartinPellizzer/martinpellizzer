                    <h1>Polygala collina var. littoralis</h1>
<p>Polygala collina var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. The plant features slender, erect stems with small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid coastal habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local insect populations.</p>
