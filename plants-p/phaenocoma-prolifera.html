                <h1>Phaenocoma prolifera</h1>
<p>Phaenocoma prolifera, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with thick, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Phaenocoma prolifera plays a vital role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds, by providing nectar and habitat.</p>
