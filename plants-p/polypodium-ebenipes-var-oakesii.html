<p>Polypodium ebenipes var. oakesii, commonly known as the Oakes' rock fern, is a variant of the rock fern genus Polypodium.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy surface. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found growing on rock surfaces or in shaded forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
