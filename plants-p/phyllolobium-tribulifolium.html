<p>Phyllolobium tribulifolium, commonly known as the sandhill milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnately lobed, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in prairies, dunes, and disturbed areas. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen into the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and adaptability, it is also used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
