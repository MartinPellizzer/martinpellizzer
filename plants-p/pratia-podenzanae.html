<p>Pratia podenzanae, commonly known as the Podenzano's pratia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Pratia podenzanae is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying plant biodiversity.</p>
