                            <h1>Pistacia Lentiscus Subvar. Subfalcata</h1>
<p>Pistacia lentiscus subvar. subfalcata is a unique subspecies of the mastic tree known for its distinctive foliage and ecological importance. Native to the Mediterranean region, this plant thrives in rocky and coastal environments where it plays a vital role in preventing soil erosion. Its leaves are narrow and often curved, giving it a striking appearance that sets it apart from other members of the Pistacia genus. The plant is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic resins. Despite its resilience, it faces threats from habitat loss and climate change, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
