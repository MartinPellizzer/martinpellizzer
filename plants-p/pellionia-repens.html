<p>Pellionia repens, commonly known as the creeping pellionia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in the axils of the leaves. Pellionia repens thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental foliage.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense mats in suitable conditions.</p>
