                    <h1>Pogonia speciosa</h1>
<p>Pogonia speciosa, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pink and white flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination trap. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic woodlands and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
