                    <h1>Platanthera stenantha</h1>
<p>Platanthera stenantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. It lacks true leaves and instead has modified leaves called phyllodes that perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Platanthera stenantha is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
