<p>Polystichum aculeatum var. flavidum, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a variant of the common holly fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green fronds with a distinctive golden-yellow margin. The plant is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically leathery and can reach lengths of up to 60 cm, making it a striking addition to woodland gardens.</p>
