<p>Panicum paludosum, commonly known as marsh panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its ability to thrive in saturated conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Panicum paludosum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
