<p>Panicum dichotomum var. nitidum, commonly known as silver panicum, is a variant of the panic grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves.

Its leaves are narrow and tapering, often with a slightly rolled edge, and it produces fluffy, seed-bearing panicles during the flowering season.</p>
<p>It is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
