                    <h1>Pinus taiwanensis var. damingshanensis</h1>
<p>Pinus taiwanensis var. damingshanensis, commonly known as the Damingshan pine, is a rare variant of the Taiwan pine native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years, releasing wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil, often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
