                    <h1>Potentilla anserina subvar. minima</h1>
<p>Potentilla anserina subvar. minima, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has slender, branched stems covered in fine, silver-gray hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh alpine conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that are also covered in a similar fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>This subvariety is well adapted to rocky soils and high altitudes, making it a hardy component of alpine flora.</p>
