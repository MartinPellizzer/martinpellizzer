<p>Piptocarpha pyrifolia, commonly known as the flamebrush or desert flamebrush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Piptocarpha pyrifolia plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
