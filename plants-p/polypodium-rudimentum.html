<p>Polypodium rudimentum, commonly known as the rudimentum fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Polypodium rudimentum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
