                    <h1>Platyadenia</h1>
<p>Platyadenia, commonly known as the "pretty lady" or "butterfly flower," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their striking, often colorful flowers that resemble butterflies. The leaves are typically narrow and opposite, while the stems are often hairy and woody. Platyadenia species are generally shrubs or small trees, and they produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they can be toxic to humans and animals.</p>
