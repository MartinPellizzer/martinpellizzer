<p>Potentilla verna proles opaca, commonly known as the opaque spring cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically features small, rounded leaves with a waxy, slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its often harsh environments.

Its flowers are actinomorphic, with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky slopes.</p>
