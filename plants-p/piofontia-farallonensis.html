                    <h1>Piofontia farallonensis</h1>
<p>Piofontia farallonensis, commonly known as the Farallon Island lichen, is a unique lichen species native to the Farallon Islands off the coast of California.</p>
<p>It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This lichen thrives in the harsh, coastal environments characterized by high salinity and strong winds. Its structure is typically crustose, forming a thin, flat layer on rock surfaces.</p>
<p>Due to its limited geographic range and specialized habitat, Piofontia farallonensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
