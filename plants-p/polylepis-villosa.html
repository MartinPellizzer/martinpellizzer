                    <h1>Polylepis villosa</h1>
<p>Polylepis villosa, commonly known as the Andean woolly tree, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and twisted, gnarled branches, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant thrives in alpine and paramo ecosystems, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its bark is thick and cork-like, providing insulation against freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>Polylepis villosa plays a crucial role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
