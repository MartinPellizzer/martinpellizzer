                    <h1>Physopsis chrysophylla</h1>
<p>Physopsis chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden-leaf physopsis, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid yellow foliage, which is a result of its unique chlorophyll composition. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the early spring. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
