<p>Plesioneuron dryopteroideum var. buruense, commonly known as the Buru water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to the island of Buru in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense, green mat on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in swampy or marshy areas. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the water.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in maintaining aquatic biodiversity.</p>
