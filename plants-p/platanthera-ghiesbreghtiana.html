                    <h1>Platanthera ghiesbreghtiana</h1>
<p>Platanthera ghiesbreghtiana, commonly known as the Ghiesbreght's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, dark purple to black flower spike adorned with small, fragrant orchid flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
