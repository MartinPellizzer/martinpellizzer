<p>Ponthieva diptera, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized root systems called pneumatophores that aid in respiration in waterlogged soils. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss and tolerate salt spray. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion.</p>
