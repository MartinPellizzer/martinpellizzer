                    <h1>Pittosporum humbertii</h1>
<p>Pittosporum humbertii, commonly known as the Huon pine, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dark, aromatic bark. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by cone-like structures containing winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and slow growth, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
