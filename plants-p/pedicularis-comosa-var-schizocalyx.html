                    <h1>Pedicularis comosa var. schizocalyx</h1>
<p>Pedicularis comosa var. schizocalyx, commonly known as the woolly monkey orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a contrasting throat. It is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats, growing in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
