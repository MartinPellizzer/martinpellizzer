<p>Pastinaca sativa subsp.</p>
<p>umbrosa, commonly known as the umbrous scorzonera, is a subspecies of the wild parsnip native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant produces a taproot that is typically smaller and less aromatic than that of the common parsnip. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its resemblance to other toxic plants, it should be handled with care.</p>
