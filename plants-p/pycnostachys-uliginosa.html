                    <h1>Pycnostachys uliginosa</h1>
<p>Pycnostachys uliginosa, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and bog habitats in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a slender, upright stem that can grow up to 60 cm in height, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and requires consistent moisture, making it a characteristic species of peat bogs.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed wetland ecosystems.</p>
