                    <h1>Phyllodes microcephala</h1>
<p>Phyllodes microcephala, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spikes at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of native Australian flora.</p>
