                    <h1>Pteris coriacea var. jamesonii</h1>
<p>Pteris coriacea var. jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's brake, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the forest floor.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
