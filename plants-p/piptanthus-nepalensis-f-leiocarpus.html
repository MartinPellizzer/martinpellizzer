<p>Piptanthus nepalensis f. leiocarpus, commonly known as the smooth-carpel piptanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and bipinnate leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its unique botanical features include smooth, leathery pods and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
