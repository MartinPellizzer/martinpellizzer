<p>Pyrus tristaniicarpa, commonly known as the Tristan's crabapple, is a rare and endemic species native to the remote Tristan da Cunha archipelago in the South Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It is a small deciduous tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal and rocky habitats. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by edible, apple-like fruits that are yellow or orange when mature. Its botanical features include alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges and a compact growth habit adapted to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
