<p>Potentilla bifurca var. deserticola, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It features small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ability to stabilize soil make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration in desert ecosystems.</p>
