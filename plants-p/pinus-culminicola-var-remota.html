                    <h1>Pinus culminicola var. remota</h1>
<p>Pinus culminicola var. remota, commonly known as the alpine limber pine, is a variant of the limber pine native to high-altitude regions of western North America.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its slender, often contorted growth form, adapted to harsh alpine conditions. It typically grows on rocky slopes and cliffs, where it forms dense, wind-resistant stands. The needles are long and slender, with a bluish-green color, and the cones are small and often persist on the branches for many years.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife.</p>
