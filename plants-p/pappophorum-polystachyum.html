                    <h1>Pappophorum polystachyum</h1>
<p>Pappophorum polystachyum, commonly known as the golden grass or false rice, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, feathery bracts that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
