<p>Pleuropteropyrum sibiricum, commonly known as the Siberian pleurocarp, is a rare and delicate moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elongated leaves that are often curved and covered in a thick layer of papillae. This species thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found on rocks or soil in arctic and alpine regions. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
