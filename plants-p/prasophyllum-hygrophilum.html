                    <h1>Prasophyllum hygrophilum</h1>
<p>Prasophyllum hygrophilum, commonly known as the swamp leek, is a species of orchid native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a rosette of fleshy, grass-like leaves that store water, adapting it to its moist, often swampy habitat. The plant produces a tall flowering stem bearing a single spike of small, pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in poorly drained soils and is often found in heathlands and swampy areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
