<p>Picea holophylla, commonly known as the white spruce, is a coniferous tree native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its distinctive white or pale green bark. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its needle-like leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Picea holophylla plays an important ecological role in boreal and subarctic forests, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
