<p>Populus tacamahacca var. candicans, commonly known as the golden poplar, is a variant of the poplar tree native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow leaves, which are typically broader and more elongated than those of other poplar species. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves seasonally, and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
