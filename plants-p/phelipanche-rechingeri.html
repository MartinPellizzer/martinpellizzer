                    <h1>Phelipanche rechingeri</h1>
<p>Phelipanche rechingeri, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It attaches to the roots of host plants, such as those in the Brassicaceae family, and derives nutrients from them. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, root-like structure called a haustorium that penetrates the host's root system. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to weaken host plants.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it can persist in soil for several years as dormant seeds.</p>
