                            <h1>Phelipanche Lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Common dodder, scientifically known as Phelipanche lanuginosa, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks leaves, stems, and roots. It relies entirely on host plants for nourishment, attaching itself with tiny, disk-like structures called haustoria. This species is commonly found in agricultural fields and gardens, where it can cause significant damage to crops. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in summer, adding a deceptive beauty to its invasive nature. Despite its appearance, common dodder is a challenging weed to control, requiring careful management to prevent its spread.</p>
