<p>Pleiocarpidia kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu pleiocarpid, is a unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive morphology, including its woody structure and specialized floral arrangements. The plant exhibits a range of adaptations to its cool, moist mountain environment, such as thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss.
