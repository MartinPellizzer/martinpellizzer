<p>Poa ochotensis subsp.</p>
<p>stepposa, commonly known as the Siberian steppe grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold regions of Asia, particularly in Siberia and the Russian Far East. It typically grows in open, low-nutrient soils of alpine and steppe environments, often forming dense, low-growing tussocks.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to harsh climatic conditions, including cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitats.</p>
