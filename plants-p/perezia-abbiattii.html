                    <h1>Perezia abbiattii</h1>
<p>Perezia abbiattii, commonly known as the Abbiatti's perezia, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, specifically in Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its elongated, grass-like leaves and a single, showy inflorescence that bears several pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
