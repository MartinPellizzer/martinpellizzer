                    <h1>Platanthera oligantha</h1>
<p>Platanthera oligantha, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense spike of small, white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Platanthera oligantha is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
