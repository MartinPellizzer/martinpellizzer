                    <h1>Phleum pratense var. viviparum</h1>
<p>Phleum pratense var. viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous timothy grass, is a variant of timothy grass characterized by its ability to produce live offspring through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its reproductive strategy involves the development of new plants from the base of the stem, a process known as viviparity.</p>
<p>This adaptation allows it to spread efficiently in suitable habitats.</p>
