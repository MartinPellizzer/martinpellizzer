<p>Phragmites communis subsp.</p>
<p>marsillianus, commonly known as the narrowleaf common reed, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands of the eastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, forming dense stands that can dominate wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces tall, branched inflorescences that contain small, feathery flowers. It plays a key role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>However, it can also become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
