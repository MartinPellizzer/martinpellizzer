<p>Potentilla fragarioides f. vegetior, commonly known as the vigorous potentilla, is a compact, deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, upright growth habit.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy, providing a textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to form a low-maintenance, ornamental ground cover.</p>
