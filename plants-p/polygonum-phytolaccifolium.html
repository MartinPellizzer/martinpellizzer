<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that often display a striking purplish hue. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread readily, making it a common weed in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other plants such as buckwheat and sorrel.</p>
