                    <h1>Populus pubescens f. vaillantiana</h1>
<p>Populus pubescens f. vaillantiana, commonly known as the Vaillantiana poplar, is a shrub-like variant of the poplar genus native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its finely hairy leaves that give it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are an important source of pollen for early pollinators. Its bark is smooth and grayish, often peeling in thin, papery layers.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture for its compact form and seasonal interest.</p>
