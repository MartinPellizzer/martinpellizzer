                    <h1>Paspalum pilgerianum</h1>
<p>Paspalum pilgerianum, commonly known as the desert grass or Pilger's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, rocky areas, and along roadsides, demonstrating a high degree of ecological resilience.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control in dry climates.</p>
