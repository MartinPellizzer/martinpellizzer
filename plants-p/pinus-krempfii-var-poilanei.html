                    <h1>Pinus krempfii var. poilanei</h1>
<p>Pinus krempfii var. poilanei, commonly known as the Poilane pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of southeastern France.</p>
<p>It is a variant of the Krempf's pine, characterized by its unique foliage and cone morphology. The leaves are typically needle-like, arranged in fascicles of five, and exhibit a bluish-green hue. The cones are small, woody, and often persist on the tree for several years.</p>
<p>This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and distinct genetic traits.</p>
