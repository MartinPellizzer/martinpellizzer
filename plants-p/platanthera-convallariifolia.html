                    <h1>Platanthera convallariifolia</h1>
<p>Platanthera convallariifolia, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem bearing lance-shaped leaves and a single, showy spike of pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant is notable for its specialized mycorrhizal associations, which are essential for its nutrient uptake in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and moths, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
