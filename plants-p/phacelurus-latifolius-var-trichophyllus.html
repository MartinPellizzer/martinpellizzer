                    <h1>Phacelurus latifolius var. trichophyllus</h1>
<p>Phacelurus latifolius var. trichophyllus, commonly known as the hairy broadleaf phacelurus, is a variant of the phacelurus genus native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are often arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>The hairy texture of its foliage is an adaptation that may help in reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
