                    <h1>Pilosella subfilifera</h1>
<p>Pilosella subfilifera, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, leaf-like stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Pilosella subfilifera is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local insect populations.</p>
