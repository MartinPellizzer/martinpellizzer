                    <h1>Potentilla colorata</h1>
<p>Potentilla colorata, commonly known as the golden potentilla, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, slender stems covered in fine, silvery-white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces showy clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Potentilla colorata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
