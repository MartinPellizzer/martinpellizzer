                <h1>Polypogon littoralis</h1>
<p>Polypogon littoralis, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a small annual grass native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils along the shoreline, demonstrating a strong adaptability to salt spray and tidal conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its tiny, wind-pollinated flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which contribute to its ability to spread efficiently in coastal environments.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ecological importance, it plays a vital role in stabilizing dune systems and supporting local wildlife.</p>
