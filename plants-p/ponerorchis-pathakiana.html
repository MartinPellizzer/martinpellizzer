                    <h1>Ponerorchis pathakiana</h1>
<p>Ponerorchis pathakiana, commonly known as the Himalayan ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom during the late spring and early summer. The plant has a specialized root system that allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and rain, adapting to its nutrient-poor mountainous environment. Its leaves are slender and often clustered at the base, supporting the plant's growth in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Ponerorchis pathakiana is considered a conservation concern.</p>
