                    <h1>Pyrethrum ptarmicifolium</h1>
<p>Pyrethrum ptarmicifolium, commonly known as the purple pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes on its leaves and stems, which contribute to its insecticidal properties. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for gardens and ornamental plantings.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its natural pyrethrin compounds, which are used in organic pest control.</p>
