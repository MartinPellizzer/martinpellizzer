                    <h1>Phycella chloracra</h1>
<p>Phycella chloracra, commonly known as the blue-green fern, is a rare and ancient plant species characterized by its unique chlorophyll-rich structure.</p>
<p>It possesses a simple, undivided frond that displays a striking blue-green hue due to the presence of chlorophyll a and b. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, relying on spore dispersal for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited geographic range and sensitivity to environmental changes, Phycella chloracra is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitats.</p>
