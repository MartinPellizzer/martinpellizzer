                    <h1>Polypodium parasiticum</h1>
<p>Polypodium parasiticum, commonly known as the parasitic fern, is a unique species of fern that exhibits parasitic behavior.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead relies on its host plant for nutrients, attaching itself to the stem or leaves of other plants. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on the trunks of trees or shrubs.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unusual lifestyle and its role in the ecological interactions of forest ecosystems.</p>
