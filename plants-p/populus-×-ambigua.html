                    <h1>Populus × ambigua</h1>
<p>Populus × ambigua, commonly known as the hybrid poplar, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between *Populus tremuloides* (quaking aspen) and *Populus balsamifera* (balsam poplar), resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical features. The leaves are ovate to triangular in shape, with serrated margins and a rough texture due to the presence of small glands. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that disperse via wind.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in open woodlands.</p>
