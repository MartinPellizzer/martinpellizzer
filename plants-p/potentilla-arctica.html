                    <h1>Potentilla arctica</h1>
<p>Potentilla arctica, commonly known as Arctic cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has alternate, serrated leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Potentilla arctica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for pollinators in its native habitats.</p>
