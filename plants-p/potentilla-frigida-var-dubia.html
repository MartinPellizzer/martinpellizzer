<p>Potentilla frigida var. dubia, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in harsh, cold environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations. Its leaves are typically silver-gray, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss in arctic conditions.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its hardiness and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cold climates.</p>
