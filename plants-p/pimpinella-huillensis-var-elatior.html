                    <h1>Pimpinella huillensis var. elatior</h1>
<p>Pimpinella huillensis var. elatior, commonly known as the Huill√©n mountain parsley, is a rare and endemic species native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to cold and harsh climatic conditions, with a compact growth habit and a short growing season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
