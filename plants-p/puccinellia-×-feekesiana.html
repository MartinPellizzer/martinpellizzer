<p>Puccinellia × feekesiana, commonly known as the hybrid saltbush, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid between Puccinellia simplisia and Puccinellia phrygana, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable component of salt-desert ecosystems. Its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit help it conserve water in harsh environments.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
