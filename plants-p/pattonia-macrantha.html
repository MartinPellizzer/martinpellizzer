                    <h1>Pattonia macrantha</h1>
<p>Pattonia macrantha, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. The plant produces showy, white to pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Pattonia macrantha plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration.</p>
