                    <h1>Passerina tarton-raira var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Passerina tarton-raira var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved passerina, is a rare variant of the Passerina genus characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>It is typically found in specific alpine or subalpine habitats where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are often blue or violet in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is densely packed, providing a dense ground cover that helps prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
