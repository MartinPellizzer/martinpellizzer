                    <h1>Phegopteris ferruginea</h1>
<p>Phegopteris ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are covered with a rusty-colored pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The rusty fern is often found in the understory of forests, where it thrives in humid, cool conditions.</p>
