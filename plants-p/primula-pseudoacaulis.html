                    <h1>Primula pseudoacaulis</h1>
<p>Primula pseudoacaulis, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with a rosette of basal leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically has hairy stems and leaves with a waxy coating, adaptations that help it survive in cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowers come in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a yellow throat.</p>
<p>Primula pseudoacaulis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
