<p>Ponerorchis pulchella, commonly known as the beautiful orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with vivid colors. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky crevices or on tree trunks. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the surrounding substrate, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild.</p>
