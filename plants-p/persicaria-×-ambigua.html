                    <h1>Persicaria × ambigua</h1>
<p>Persicaria × ambigua, commonly known as the hybrid polygonum, is a perennial flowering plant that exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Persicaria amplexicaulis and Persicaria hybrida.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight. The plant produces showy, red or pink flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a velvety texture, and the stems are often reddish in color.</p>
<p>Persicaria × ambigua is valued in wetland restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
