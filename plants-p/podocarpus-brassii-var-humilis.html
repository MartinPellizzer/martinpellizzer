                    <h1>Podocarpus brassii var. humilis</h1>
<p>Podocarpus brassii var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf podocarp, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage with a compact, rounded shape, making it ideal for hedging or ornamental use. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, typical of the Podocarpaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and resilience to pruning make it a popular choice for landscaping in coastal and subtropical regions.</p>
