                    <h1>Pinus pinaster var. lemoniana</h1>
<p>Pinus pinaster var. lemoniana, commonly known as the lemon-scented pine, is a variant of the maritime pine native to the western Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinct lemon-like fragrance emitted from its leaves, which is due to the presence of volatile oils. The tree typically grows as a tall, straight-stemmed evergreen with a conical shape when young, developing a more irregular form with age. Its needles are slender, dark green, and often have a waxy coating, while its cones are woody and elongated.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in reforestation efforts due to its adaptability to various soil types.</p>
