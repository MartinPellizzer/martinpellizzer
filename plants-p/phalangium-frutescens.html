                    <h1>Phalangium frutescens</h1>
<p>Phalangium frutescens, commonly known as the redstem filaree, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are often reddish in color, which help it conserve water in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
