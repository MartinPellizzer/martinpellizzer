                    <h1>Paphiopedilum urbanianum</h1>
<p>Paphiopedilum urbanianum, commonly known as the Urban's lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination trap, a feature common among orchids. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on forest floors or rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish with intricate patterns, and it has thick, fleshy roots adapted to absorb moisture from the environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild.</p>
