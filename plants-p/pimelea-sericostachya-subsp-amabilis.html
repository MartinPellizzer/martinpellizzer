<p>Pimelea sericostachya subsp.</p>
<p>amabilis, commonly known as the silky broomrape, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its dense, yellowish-green foliage and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It typically grows in heathlands and open woodlands, often in association with eucalyptus trees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
