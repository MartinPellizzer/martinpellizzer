                    <h1>Perlarius asper</h1>
<p>Perlarius asper, commonly known as the rough perlarius, is a rare and hardy plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rugged, woody stems and small, dark green leaves with a textured surface. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers in the summer, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
