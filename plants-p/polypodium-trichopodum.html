                    <h1>Polypodium trichopodum</h1>
<p>Polypodium trichopodum, commonly known as the southern shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit with a dense, leathery frond that is typically divided into segments. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The fern's compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden cultivation.</p>
