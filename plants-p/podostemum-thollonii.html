                    <h1>Podostemum thollonii</h1>
<p>Podostemum thollonii, commonly known as the African water primrose, is a rare aquatic plant found in the fast-flowing streams of Central and West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are often submerged in water, adapted to its aquatic environment. The plant has specialized structures called stolons that allow it to spread along the riverbed. Its flowers are typically small and occur in clusters, often with bright colors to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered an important indicator species for freshwater ecosystems.</p>
