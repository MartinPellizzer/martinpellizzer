<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and dense, carpet-like growth habit. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Poa patens has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Its small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences are usually inconspicuous, contributing to its role in ecological systems.</p>
