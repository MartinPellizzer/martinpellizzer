<p>Panicum daltonii, commonly known as Dalton's panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to protect its natural environment.</p>
