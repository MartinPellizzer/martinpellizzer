<p>Pleopeltis loriformis var. steniste, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
