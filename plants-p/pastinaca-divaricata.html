<p>Pastinaca divaricata, commonly known as the creeping bur marigold, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist soils. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. Its showy yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer, are borne on leafy, branched stems.</p>
<p>Pastinaca divaricata is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
