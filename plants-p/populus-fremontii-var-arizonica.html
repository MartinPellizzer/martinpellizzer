                    <h1>Populus fremontii var. arizonica</h1>
<p>Populus fremontii var. arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and its ability to thrive in riparian zones along rivers and streams. The tree produces catkins that release seeds with feathery parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal. Its bark is typically gray to reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to arid environments and plays a crucial role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
