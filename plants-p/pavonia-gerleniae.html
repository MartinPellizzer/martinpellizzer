                    <h1>Pavonia gerleniae</h1>
<p>Pavonia gerleniae, commonly known as the desert pavonia, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, pink to red bract-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Pavonia gerleniae reflect its evolutionary adaptation to survive in drought-prone ecosystems.</p>
