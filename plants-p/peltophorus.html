                    <h1>Peltophorus</h1>
<p>Peltophorus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their large, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The leaves are thick and waxy, providing buoyancy and protection from aquatic herbivores. The flowers have a unique structure with a prominent spadix and are pollinated by specific species of beetles.</p>
<p>Peltophorus plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to nutrient cycling in the water.</p>
