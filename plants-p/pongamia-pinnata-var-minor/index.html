                            <h1>Pongamia Pinnata Var. Minor</h1>
<p>Pongamia pinnata var. minor is a lesser-known variant of the pongam tree known for its unique ecological and potential economic value. Native to parts of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. Its small, compound leaves and distinctive seed pods make it easily distinguishable from other pongam species. Despite its limited commercial cultivation, it holds promise for use in biofuel production and soil stabilization. Further research could unlock its full potential as a sustainable resource.</p>
