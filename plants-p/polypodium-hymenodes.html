                    <h1>Polypodium hymenodes</h1>
<p>Polypodium hymenodes, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of polypody that thrives in rocky, humid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of ferns. It is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, and prefers shaded, moist habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
