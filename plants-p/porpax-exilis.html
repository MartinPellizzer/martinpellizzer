                    <h1>Porpax exilis</h1>
<p>Porpax exilis, commonly known as the slender porpax, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale blue or violet flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically from late winter to early spring. Porpax exilis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
