<p>Primula farinosa subsp.</p>
<p>longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, adding early color to the landscape.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
