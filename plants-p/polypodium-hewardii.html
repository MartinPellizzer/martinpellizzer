<p>Polypodium hewardii, commonly known as the Heward's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
