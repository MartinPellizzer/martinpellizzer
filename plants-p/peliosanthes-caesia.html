                    <h1>Peliosanthes caesia</h1>
<p>Peliosanthes caesia, commonly known as the blue-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Peliosanthes caesia is considered endangered and is protected in many countries.</p>
