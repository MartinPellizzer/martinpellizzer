                    <h1>Platanthera volcanica</h1>
<p>Platanthera volcanica, commonly known as the volcanic orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific volcanic regions.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions to thrive. Its survival is closely tied to the unique geology of its habitat, which includes volcanic rock and soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
