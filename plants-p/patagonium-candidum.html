                    <h1>Patagonium candidum</h1>
<p>Patagonium candidum, commonly known as the white cushion plant, is a low-growing succulent native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of fleshy, white or pale green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and cold environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are pollinated by insects. Its root system is shallow but extensive, enabling it to anchor itself in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Patagonium candidum plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem.</p>
