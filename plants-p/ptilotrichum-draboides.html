                    <h1>Ptilotrichum draboides</h1>
<p>Ptilotrichum draboides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically borne in dense clusters near the base of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Ptilotrichum draboides is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops.</p>
