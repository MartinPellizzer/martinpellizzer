                    <h1>Prunus spinosa subvar. wallrothii</h1>
<p>Prunus spinosa subvar. wallrothii, commonly known as the Wallroth's blackthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark purple-black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in woodlands and scrublands. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>The berries are used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye, though the plant is generally toxic if ingested in large quantities.</p>
