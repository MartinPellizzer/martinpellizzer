<p>Panicum fuscum var. majus, commonly known as purple lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its striking purple to reddish-pink inflorescences that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed soils and open habitats. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that becomes more intense in full sun.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
