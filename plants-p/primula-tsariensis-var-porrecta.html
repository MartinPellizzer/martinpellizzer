                    <h1>Primula tsariensis var. porrecta</h1>
<p>Primula tsariensis var. porrecta, commonly known as the Siberian primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a hairy surface that helps retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of pink or white, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens.</p>
