                    <h1>Papaver sendtneri var. fallacinum</h1>
<p>Papaver sendtneri var. fallacinum, commonly known as the autumn poppy, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red, blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of a fern, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
