                    <h1>Pleocnemia hemiteliiformis</h1>
<p>Pleocnemia hemiteliiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pleocnemia, is a rare fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in montane forests. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are surrounded by a protective layer of specialized tissue.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
