<p>Prosopis nuda, commonly known as the silky mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Prosopis nuda is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in its native habitat.</p>
