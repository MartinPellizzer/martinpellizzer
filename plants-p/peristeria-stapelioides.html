                    <h1>Peristeria stapelioides</h1>
<p>Peristeria stapelioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its thick, fleshy stems for photosynthesis. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, often resembling small ghosts, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its natural range.</p>
