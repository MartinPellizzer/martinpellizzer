                    <h1>Potentilla nivalis var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Potentilla nivalis var. intermedia, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, often hairy stems and compound leaves with several leaflets, adapted to withstand cold and harsh mountain conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for high-altitude environments where few plants can survive.</p>
