                    <h1>Protasparagus graniticus</h1>
<p>Protasparagus graniticus, commonly known as the granite asparagus, is a rare and hardy plant adapted to grow in rocky, nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling stems and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by insects. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
