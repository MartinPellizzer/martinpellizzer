<p>Potentilla anserina var. communis, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, rocky slopes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat support in natural landscapes.</p>
