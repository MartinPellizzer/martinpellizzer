<p>Pseudocyclosorus gamblei, commonly known as the Gambie fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, supporting the growth of its compound leaves.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild.</p>
