<p>Pogonia elegantula, commonly known as the pink fairy orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy pink or purple flower that blooms in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands, often growing on the forest floor. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Pogonia elegantula is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
