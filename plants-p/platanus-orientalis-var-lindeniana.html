<p>Platanus orientalis var. lindeniana, commonly known as the Lindeniana sycamore, is a variant of the oriental plane tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of gray and white. The leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a rough, serrated edge. It produces small, spherical, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by woody, spherical fruits.</p>
<p>This tree is often found in urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compacted soils.</p>
