                    <h1>Pteris laeta</h1>
<p>Pteris laeta, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white or silver hairs, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia, which are responsible for its reproduction.</p>
<p>The silver fern is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
