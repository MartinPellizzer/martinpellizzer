                    <h1>Pedilonum salmoneum</h1>
<p>Pedilonum salmoneum, commonly known as the golden foot plant, is a rare flowering species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow petals and unique foot-like appendages on its stems, which give it its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its blooming period occurs during the late spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to climate change, Pedilonum salmoneum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
