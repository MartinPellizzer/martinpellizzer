<p>Pleurothallis mejiae, commonly known as the Mejia's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it often grows on trees or rocks rather than in the ground.</p>
<p>Pleurothallis mejiae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is a subject of interest in botanical research due to its unique morphology and ecological niche.</p>
