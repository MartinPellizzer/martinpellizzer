                    <h1>Phoradendron gardnerianum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron gardnerianum, commonly known as the Gardner's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in a fine, powdery coating.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects while also affecting the growth of its host trees.</p>
