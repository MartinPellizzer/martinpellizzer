                    <h1>Paraknoxia ruziziensis</h1>
<p>Paraknoxia ruziziensis, commonly known as the Ruziziensis cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the Eastern African region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, stiff, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones ovoid, typical of cycads. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a humid climate with partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
