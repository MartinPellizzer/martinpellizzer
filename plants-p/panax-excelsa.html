                    <h1>Panax excelsa</h1>
<p>Panax excelsa, commonly known as the giant ginseng, is a rare and highly valued plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves and distinctive yellowish-brown root system. The plant is known for its slow growth and can take up to 15 years to mature, making it a prized commodity in traditional medicine. Its roots contain various bioactive compounds, including ginsenosides, which are believed to have medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Panax excelsa is now listed as an endangered species.</p>
