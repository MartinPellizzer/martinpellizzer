<p>Polypogon magellanicus, commonly known as the Antarctic grass, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that thrives in cold, arid environments, particularly in the Andes and Patagonia. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Polypogon magellanicus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is adapted to survive in extreme environmental conditions.</p>
