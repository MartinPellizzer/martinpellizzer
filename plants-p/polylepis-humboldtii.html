<p>Polylepis humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt's polylepis, is a tree species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and thick, flaky bark that provides protection against forest fires. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically between 2,500 and 4,500 meters above sea level. Its leaves are small, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Polylepis humboldtii plays a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance by providing habitat and food for various endemic species.</p>
