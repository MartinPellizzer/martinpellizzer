<p>Pedicularis sylvatica, commonly known as the lady's smock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its distinctive pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for nutrients through its roots. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, with a basal rosette structure that helps it survive in cooler climates.</p>
