                    <h1>Platanthera hyperborea var. leucostachys</h1>
<p>Platanthera hyperborea var. leucostachys, commonly known as the white-stemmed bog orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in northern temperate regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in wet, acidic, and nutrient-poor habitats such as bogs and fens. The plant has a slender, erect stem that is often covered in a dense, white to pale green pubescence. Its flowers are small and arranged in a raceme, with white petals and sepals that are typically tinged with green.</p>
<p>The species relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its adaptation to its challenging ecological niche.</p>
