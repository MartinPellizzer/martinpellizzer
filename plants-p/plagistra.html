                    <h1>Plagistra</h1>
<p>Plagistra, commonly known as the swamp bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures used for trapping tiny aquatic organisms. Plagistra species are typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. They are carnivorous, relying on the captured prey for nutrients in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>The plant's morphology includes slender stems and floating leaves that help it thrive in aquatic conditions.</p>
