                    <h1>Poa aitchisonii</h1>
<p>Poa aitchisonii, commonly known as the Aitchison's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming dense, mat-like colonies. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Poa aitchisonii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
