                    <h1>Pseudosempervivum gurulkanii</h1>
<p>Pseudosempervivum gurulkanii, commonly known as the Gurulkanii stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features compact, rosette-shaped foliage with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the summer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
