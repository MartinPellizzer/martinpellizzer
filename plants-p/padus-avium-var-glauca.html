<p>Padus avium var. glauca, commonly known as the whitehorn cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to white bark, which becomes fissured with age, and its small, oval leaves that are typically hairy underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open areas.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in hedgerows and landscape design.</p>
