                    <h1>Polygonum aviculare var. longifolium</h1>
<p>Polygonum aviculare var. longifolium, commonly known as slender knotweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and often have a reddish or purple tinge along the midrib.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in moist meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
