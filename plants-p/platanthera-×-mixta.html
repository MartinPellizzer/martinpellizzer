                    <h1>Platanthera × mixta</h1>
<p>Platanthera × mixta, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Platanthera chlorophaea and Platanthera falcata.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. The plant features tall, slender stems with lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale green. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and swampy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival.</p>
