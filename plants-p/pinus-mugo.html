                    <h1>Pinus mugo</h1>
<p>Pinus mugo, commonly known as the mountain pine, is a small evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, twisted branches and dense, needle-like leaves that are dark green and slightly curved. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Pinus mugo is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil in mountainous and alpine ecosystems.</p>
