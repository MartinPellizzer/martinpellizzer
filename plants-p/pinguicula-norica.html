                    <h1>Pinguicula norica</h1>
<p>Pinguicula norica, commonly known as the Alpine butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils at high altitudes, where it forms a compact, low-growing structure. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Pinguicula norica is well adapted to nutrient-poor environments, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients.</p>
