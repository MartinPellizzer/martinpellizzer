                    <h1>Phaca fendleri</h1>
<p>Phaca fendleri, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant contains latex sap, which can be irritating to the skin and is used in traditional medicinal practices by some indigenous communities.</p>
