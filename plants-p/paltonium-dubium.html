                    <h1>Paltonium dubium</h1>
<p>Paltonium dubium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and its striking, orchid-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Paltonium dubium is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
