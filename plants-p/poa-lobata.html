                    <h1>Poa lobata</h1>
<p>Poa lobata, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Poa lobata is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and withstand drought conditions.</p>
