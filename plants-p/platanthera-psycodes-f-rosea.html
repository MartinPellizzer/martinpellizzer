                    <h1>Platanthera psycodes f. rosea</h1>
<p>Platanthera psycodes f. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered marsh orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to rose-colored flowers, which are clustered in a raceme and emit a subtle fragrance. The plant typically grows in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes and meadows, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a slender, erect stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
