                    <h1>Pseudophegopteris fijiensis</h1>
<p>Pseudophegopteris fijiensis, commonly known as the Fiji cliff fern, is a unique species of fern native to the tropical regions of the South Pacific, particularly Fiji.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often clustered at the base of rocky outcrops or on cliff faces. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to anchor itself in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a distinctive, serrated edge.</p>
<p>This fern is adapted to harsh, sun-exposed environments and plays a role in stabilizing rocky habitats through its dense growth.</p>
