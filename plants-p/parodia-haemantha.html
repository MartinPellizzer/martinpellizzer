                    <h1>Parodia haemantha</h1>
<p>Parodia haemantha, commonly known as the red-spurred cactus, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically ribbed and covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and reducing transpiration through its spiny covering.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
