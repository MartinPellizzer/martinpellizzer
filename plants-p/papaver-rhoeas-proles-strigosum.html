                    <h1>Papaver rhoeas proles strigosum</h1>
<p>Papaver rhoeas proles strigosum, commonly known as the hairy poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its hairy stems and leaves.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers with a dark central stigma, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its hairy texture is an adaptation that may help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its vibrant color and unique appearance.</p>
