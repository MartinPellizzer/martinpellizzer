                    <h1>Phoradendron chrysocarpum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron chrysocarpum, commonly known as golden fruit mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Cecropia*.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are an important food source for certain bird species. Its leaves are alternate and opposite, with a leathery texture and a distinctive waxy coating.</p>
<p>The species is native to tropical regions of South America and is often found in humid, shaded environments.</p>
