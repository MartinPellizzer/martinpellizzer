<p>Parthenium elliotanum, commonly known as Elliot's ragweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is an annual herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense heads, and it is known for its high allergenic potential due to the fine, wind-dispersed pollen it releases. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a distinctive bitter taste.</p>
<p>Elliot's ragweed is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid environments.</p>
