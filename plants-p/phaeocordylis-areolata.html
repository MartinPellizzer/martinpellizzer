                    <h1>Phaeocordylis areolata</h1>
<p>Phaeocordylis areolata, commonly known as the spotted coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying instead on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients. The plant produces a cluster of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its roots are specialized to form symbiotic relationships with fungi, which is a key feature of its botanical structure.</p>
<p>The plant's unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
