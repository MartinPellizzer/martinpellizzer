<p>Pleurothallis henrici, commonly known as the Henry's pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has linear to lanceolate leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its flowers are often clustered in inflorescences and are adapted for pollination by small insects.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated by enthusiasts but remains relatively rare in the wild.</p>
