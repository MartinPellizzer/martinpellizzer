                    <h1>Pterocaulon tomentosus</h1>
<p>Pterocaulon tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly pterocaulon, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are typically small and often shed during dry periods, allowing the stems to store water.</p>
<p>Pterocaulon tomentosus is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water once established.</p>
