                    <h1>Parnassia delavayi var. brevistyla</h1>
<p>Parnassia delavayi var. brevistyla, commonly known as the short-styled parnassia, is a flowering plant species native to the high-altitude regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its delicate, white, five-petaled flowers that resemble those of true lilies. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows and forest understories. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cool, high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
