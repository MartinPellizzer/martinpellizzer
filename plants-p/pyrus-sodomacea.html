                    <h1>Pyrus sodomacea</h1>
<p>Pyrus sodomacea, commonly known as the Sodom apple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny branches and small, yellowish-green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spring, which are followed by edible, apple-like fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. Its fruits are highly acidic and contain a high concentration of malic acid, making them useful in winemaking and as a souring agent.</p>
<p>Pyrus sodomacea is also noted for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
