                    <h1>Plantago mongolica</h1>
<p>Plantago mongolica, commonly known as Mongolian plantain, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of broad, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
