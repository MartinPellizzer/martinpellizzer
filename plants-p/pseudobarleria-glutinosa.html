                    <h1>Pseudobarleria glutinosa</h1>
<p>Pseudobarleria glutinosa, commonly known as sticky false balm, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps in deterring herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Pseudobarleria glutinosa is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it contributes to local biodiversity.</p>
