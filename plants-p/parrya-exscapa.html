                    <h1>Parrya exscapa</h1>
<p>Parrya exscapa, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Parrya exscapa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
