                    <h1>Paepalanthus capillaceus var. prolifer</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus capillaceus var. prolifer, commonly known as the hairy pincushion cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America, particularly Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by pale green fruits. Its leaves are reduced to short, woolly bristles, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
