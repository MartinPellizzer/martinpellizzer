                    <h1>Pilosocereus × pseudosuperfloccosus</h1>
<p>Pilosocereus × pseudosuperfloccosus, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a hybrid cactus species native to the deserts of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly spines, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bats and insects. It is a slow-growing plant that requires well-draining soil and minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and nocturnal blooming habits make it a striking and unusual addition to succulent collections.</p>
