                    <h1>Pleopeltis araneosa</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis araneosa, commonly known as the spider fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble a spider's web, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture from the air.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
