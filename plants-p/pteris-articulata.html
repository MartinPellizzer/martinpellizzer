                    <h1>Pteris articulata</h1>
<p>Pteris articulata, commonly known as the segmented water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pinnately compound fronds that are often divided into segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near water sources such as ponds or streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while the fronds are used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
