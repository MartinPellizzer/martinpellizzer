                    <h1>Pedicularis rex var. parva</h1>
<p>Pedicularis rex var. parva, commonly known as the dwarf crownfire lousewort, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the high elevations of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of red and orange, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its small size and specialized habitat make it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological fragility, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
