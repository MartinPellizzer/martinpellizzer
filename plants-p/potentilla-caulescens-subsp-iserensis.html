<p>Potentilla caulescens subsp.</p>
<p>iserensis, commonly known as the Iseren potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of five-petaled flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of white to pale yellow. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
