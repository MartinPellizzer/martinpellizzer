                    <h1>Ptilotus exaltatus</h1>
<p>Ptilotus exaltatus, commonly known as the "Desert Flax," is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a slender, branching stem and narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its seeds are enclosed in small, hairy capsules, which aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Ptilotus exaltatus is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures and drought conditions.</p>
