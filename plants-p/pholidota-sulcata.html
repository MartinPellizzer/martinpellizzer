                    <h1>Pholidota sulcata</h1>
<p>Pholidota sulcata, commonly known as the African spurred tortoise, is a large terrestrial tortoise native to the savannas of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust body, high-domed shell, and distinctive spurred toes. The plant-like appearance of its shell and the presence of leaf-like scutes give it a unique botanical resemblance to certain succulent plants. While not a plant, its name may be confused with botanical terms due to its foliage-like features.</p>
<p>This species is often mistaken for a plant due to its slow growth and appearance, but it is strictly an animal.</p>
