<p>Polypodium gauthieri, commonly known as the Gauthier's sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments with a serrated margin. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
