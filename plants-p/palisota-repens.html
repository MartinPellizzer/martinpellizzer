<p>Palisota repens, commonly known as creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It has slender,匍匐 (creeping) stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, greenish flowers that are often overlooked. Its leaves are narrow and linear, typically with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Palisota repens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
