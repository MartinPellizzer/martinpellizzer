                    <h1>Pandanus terrireginae</h1>
<p>Pandanus terrireginae, commonly known as the Teneriffe pandanus, is a rare and unique species native to the island of Teneriffe in the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Pandanaceae family, characterized by its feather-like leaves and robust, fibrous structure. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to salt-laden winds. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
