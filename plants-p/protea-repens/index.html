                            <h1>Protea Repens</h1>
<p>Common protea, scientifically known as Protea repens, is a strikingly beautiful plant native to southern Africa. It is renowned for its vibrant, cone-shaped flower heads that come in a range of colors from white to pink and red. This species thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements. Despite its ornamental value, the common protea also plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
