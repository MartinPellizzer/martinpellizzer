<p>Pseudobahia peirsonii, commonly known as the broadleaf spurge, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it a common ornamental in landscapes, though it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
