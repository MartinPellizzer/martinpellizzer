<p>Pteris dayakorum, commonly known as the Dayak's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released into the air for dispersal.</p>
<p>Pteris dayakorum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem.</p>
