                    <h1>Poa retroflexa</h1>
<p>Poa retroflexa, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Poa retroflexa is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas.</p>
