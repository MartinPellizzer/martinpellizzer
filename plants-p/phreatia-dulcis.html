<p>Phreatia dulcis, commonly known as the sweet phreatia, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in lowland rainforests. The plant has strap-like leaves that are dark green and often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that is often spotted or streaked.</p>
<p>Phreatia dulcis is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
