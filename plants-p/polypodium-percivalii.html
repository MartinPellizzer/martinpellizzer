                    <h1>Polypodium percivalii</h1>
<p>Polypodium percivalii, commonly known as the Percivalâ€™s huperzia, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery, evergreen leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
