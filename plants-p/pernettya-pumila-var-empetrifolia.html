<p>Pernettya pumila var. empetrifolia, commonly known as the dwarf cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces tiny, red berries that are edible and often used in local cuisine. It thrives in harsh, cold climates and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ability to survive in extreme conditions make it an important component of tundra ecosystems.</p>
