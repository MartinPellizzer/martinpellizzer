                    <h1>Pterozonium retroflexum</h1>
<p>Pterozonium retroflexum, commonly known as the backward-leafed fern, is a unique species of fern characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology.</p>
<p>Its fronds are typically elongated and have a retroflex arrangement, meaning they curl backward, which is a rare trait among ferns. The plant produces small, sporangia-bearing structures on the underside of its leaves, facilitating spore dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth habits, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
