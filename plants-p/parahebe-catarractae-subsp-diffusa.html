<p>Parahebe catarractae subsp.</p>
<p>diffusa, commonly known as the silver-leaved parahebe, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silvery-gray leaves that provide a striking visual contrast.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in coastal landscapes.</p>
