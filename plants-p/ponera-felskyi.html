                    <h1>Ponera felskyi</h1>
<p>Ponera felskyi, commonly known as the Felskyi's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique, elongated flower structure that sets it apart from other orchid species. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ponera felskyi is considered endangered and is the subject of ongoing conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its botanical study provides valuable insights into the adaptation strategies of epiphytic orchids in tropical ecosystems.</p>
