                            <h1>Prunus Azorica</h1>
<p>Azores cherry, scientifically known as Prunus azorica, is a rare and unique species native to the volcanic islands of the Azores. This small evergreen tree is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and clusters of fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, edible cherries that are prized for their delicate flavor and medicinal properties. Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from climate change, the Azores cherry is considered an endangered species. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this rare botanical treasure.</p>
