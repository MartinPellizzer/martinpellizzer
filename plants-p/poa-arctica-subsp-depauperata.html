<p>Poa arctica subsp.</p>
<p>depauperata, commonly known as the arctic grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to cold climates. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh Arctic and alpine conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are arranged in spikelets.</p>
<p>The plant plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its extreme environment and is an important component of tundra ecosystems.</p>
