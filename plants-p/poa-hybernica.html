<p>Poa hybernica, commonly known as the winter bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as woodland floors and heathlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to cool, wet conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Poa hybernica plays an important role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
