                    <h1>Pseudolasiacis leptolomoides var. coursii</h1>
<p>Pseudolasiacis leptolomoides var. coursii, commonly known as the Coursii's false lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae and is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically crustose or foliose. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which is essential for its survival in specific ecological niches. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on decaying wood or rock surfaces.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
