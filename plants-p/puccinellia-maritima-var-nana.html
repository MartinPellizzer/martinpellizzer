<p>Puccinellia maritima var. nana, commonly known as sea panic grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, narrow leaves. The plant typically thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
