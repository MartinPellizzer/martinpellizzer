<p>Polypodium fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, upright fronds that form a compact, bushy appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous areas. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
