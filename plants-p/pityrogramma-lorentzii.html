<p>Pityrogramma lorentzii, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into small, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
