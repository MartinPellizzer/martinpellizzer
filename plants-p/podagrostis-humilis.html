                    <h1>Podagrostis humilis</h1>
<p>Podagrostis humilis, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, tufted clumps with slender, leaf-like blades that are often less than 10 cm in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in ornamental gardens.</p>
