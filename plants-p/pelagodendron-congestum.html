                    <h1>Pelagodendron congestum</h1>
<p>Pelagodendron congestum, commonly known as the sea pine, is a unique marine plant that thrives in shallow coastal waters.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branching structure composed of flexible, needle-like leaves. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on its rhizoidal structures for anchorage and nutrient absorption. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically developing in clusters along the stems.</p>
<p>Pelagodendron congestum plays a significant role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms.</p>
