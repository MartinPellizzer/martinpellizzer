                    <h1>Pedicularis latibracteata</h1>
<p>Pedicularis latibracteata, commonly known as the broad-bract lousewort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from its host. The plant features showy, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple, and it typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its leaves are often reduced to bracts, which are broad and leaf-like, contributing to its common name.</p>
