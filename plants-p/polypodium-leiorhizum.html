                    <h1>Polypodium leiorhizum</h1>
<p>Polypodium leiorhizum, commonly known as the broad-leafed polypody, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often as an epiphyte. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, which help it store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a distinctive pattern.</p>
