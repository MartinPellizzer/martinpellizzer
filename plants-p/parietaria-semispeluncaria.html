                    <h1>Parietaria semispeluncaria</h1>
<p>Parietaria semispeluncaria, commonly known as the cave parietaria, is a rare and specialized plant species adapted to grow in dark, humid environments such as caves and rock crevices.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and possesses small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. The plant relies on limited light penetration and has developed mechanisms to thrive in low-light conditions. Its leaves are usually pale green and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its moist, subterranean habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited ecological significance outside its specific niche.</p>
