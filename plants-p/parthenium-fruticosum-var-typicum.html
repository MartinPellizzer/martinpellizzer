<p>Parthenium fruticosum var. typicum, commonly known as the coastal parthenium, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or saline soils, adapting well to harsh coastal environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense heads, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
