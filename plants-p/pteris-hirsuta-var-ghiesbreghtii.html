<p>Pteris hirsuta var. ghiesbreghtii, commonly known as the Ghiesbreght's water fern, is a variant of the common hairscale fern.</p>
<p>It is a fern species native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, which help anchor it in wet soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bright green, with a soft, velvety texture that distinguishes it from other fern varieties.</p>
