                    <h1>Pabstiella mentigera</h1>
<p>Pabstiella mentigera, commonly known as the Mentigera lichen, is a rare and specialized symbiotic organism that forms a lichen with a fungal partner.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically crustose and grows on calcareous substrates. The plant's morphology includes a dark, leathery surface with distinct lobes and a central areola. It is primarily found in humid, temperate regions with high moisture levels.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
