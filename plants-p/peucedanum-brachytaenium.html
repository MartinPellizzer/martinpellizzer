<p>Peucedanum brachytaenium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cowparsley, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its native range.</p>
