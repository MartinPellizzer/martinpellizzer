                    <h1>Poa × pawlowskii</h1>
<p>Poa × pawlowskii, commonly known as the hybrid bluegrass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Poa annua and Poa trivialis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and a dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically forms a sod-like structure, making it suitable for turfgrass applications. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce seeds and is propagated vegetatively.</p>
