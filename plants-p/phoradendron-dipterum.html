                    <h1>Phoradendron dipterum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron dipterum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or green berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Its leaves are evergreen, and it can grow in dense clusters, forming a tangled mass on the host.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Phoradendron dipterum plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the ecological balance.</p>
