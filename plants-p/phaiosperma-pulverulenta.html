                    <h1>Phaiosperma pulverulenta</h1>
<p>Phaiosperma pulverulenta, commonly known as the dust fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that grow in a rosette formation. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its unique reproductive structures, including sporangia that release spores, are adapted for dispersal in moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
