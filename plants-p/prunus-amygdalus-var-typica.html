                    <h1>Prunus amygdalus var. typica</h1>
<p>Prunus amygdalus var. typica, commonly known as the sweet almond tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Middle East and South Asia.</p>
<p>It produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by the development of drupes containing the edible almond seeds. The tree typically grows to a height of 5â€“10 meters and has smooth, gray bark with a pleasant almond scent. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped with a serrated margin.</p>
<p>The fruit is harvested when the outer hull splits open, revealing the hard, brown shell enclosing the kernel.</p>
