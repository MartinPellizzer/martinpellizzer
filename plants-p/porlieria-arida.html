<p>Porlieria arida, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a robust root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are small and succulent, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Porlieria arida is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
