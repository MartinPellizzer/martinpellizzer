                    <h1>Primula minima</h1>
<p>Primula minima, commonly known as the dwarf primrose, is a small perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
