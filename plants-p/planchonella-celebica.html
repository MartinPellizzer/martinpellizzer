<p>Planchonella celebica, commonly known as the Celebes sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Maluku Islands of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, spiny fruits containing a single seed. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional crafts and incense.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species.</p>
