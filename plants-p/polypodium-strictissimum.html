<p>Polypodium strictissimum, commonly known as the rigid wall-rue, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, rigid fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>The rigid structure of its fronds helps it retain moisture and resist damage from wind and rain.</p>
