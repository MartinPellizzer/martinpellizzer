<p>Pimpinella dumetorum, commonly known as fool's parsley, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white or greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 centimeters and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its resemblance to edible plants, it is sometimes mistaken for parsley or cumin, though it contains toxic compounds that can be harmful if ingested.</p>
