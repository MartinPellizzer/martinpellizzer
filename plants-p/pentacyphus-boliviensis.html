                    <h1>Pentacyphus boliviensis</h1>
<p>Pentacyphus boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian cycad, is a unique plant native to the high Andes of Bolivia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones rather than flowers.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
