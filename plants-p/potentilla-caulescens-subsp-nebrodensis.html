<p>Potentilla caulescens subsp.</p>
<p>nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebroden alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the European Alps. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with erect, hairy stems and small, bright yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it is adapted to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces fruiting structures known as achenes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations in mountainous environments.</p>
