The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
