                    <h1>Pellaea compacta</h1>
<p>Pellaea compacta, commonly known as the compact pellaea, is a species of fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, contributing to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
