                    <h1>Phegopteris spenceri</h1>
<p>Phegopteris spenceri, commonly known as the Spencer's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, which help stabilize the substrate.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting small aquatic organisms.</p>
