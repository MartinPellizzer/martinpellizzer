<p>Pericaulon perfoliatum, commonly known as the perforate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often perforated or have a distinctive leaf sheath structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soil.</p>
<p>Pericaulon perfoliatum plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
