<p>Portulaca pilosa var. tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous portulaca, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance.</p>
<p>The tuberous roots are thick and fleshy, serving as an adaptation for survival in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
