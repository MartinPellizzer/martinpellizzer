<p>Prevostea poggei, commonly known as the Boggy Bolete, is a species of bolete mushroom found in wet, forested areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow cap that often turns reddish-brown with age, and a thick, white to pale yellow stem. The pores of Prevostea poggei are yellow and do not change color when bruised, a key identifying feature. It typically grows in association with coniferous trees, particularly in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This mushroom is edible but is often overlooked due to its subtle appearance and habitat preferences.</p>
