                    <h1>Polypodium submarginale</h1>
<p>Polypodium submarginale, commonly known as the marginal holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature common among many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its rhizome is creeping and can form dense colonies, making it a common sight in forest understories.</p>
