                    <h1>Podocarpus trinitensis</h1>
<p>Podocarpus trinitensis, commonly known as the Trinidad ironwood, is a species of conifer native to the Caribbean island of Trinidad.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has historically been used for construction and furniture.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
