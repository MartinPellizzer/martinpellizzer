<p>Polypodium myriophyllum, commonly known as the water fern, is a type of fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. It is typically found in wetlands, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
