<p>Pteris quadriaurita var. khasiana, commonly known as the Khasi water fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds with a distinctive, finely toothed margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, aiding in its ability to colonize rocky or forested soils.</p>
<p>The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their aesthetic appeal.</p>
