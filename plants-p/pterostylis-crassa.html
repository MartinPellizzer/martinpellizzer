                    <h1>Pterostylis crassa</h1>
<p>Pterostylis crassa, commonly known as the broad-leafed helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features a slender, leafy stem with a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower that resembles a helmet. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly wasps, which are attracted by the flower's structure and scent.</p>
<p>The orchid's morphology reflects its adaptation to specific ecological niches and its reliance on specialized pollinators.</p>
