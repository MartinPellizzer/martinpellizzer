<p>Phalaris angusta monstr.</p>
<p>bracteata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved beakgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy.</p>
<p>The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
