<p>Polyspora bidoupensis, commonly known as the Bidoupensis star moss, is a rare and endemic species native to the rainforests of southern Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Polysporaceae family, characterized by its unique morphology and ecological adaptations. The plant exhibits a dense, cushion-like growth form, with small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of moss-like structures. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found on rocky substrates or in the undergrowth of dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region.</p>
