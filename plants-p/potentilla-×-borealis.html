                    <h1>Potentilla × borealis</h1>
<p>Potentilla × borealis, commonly known as the Arctic potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, deciduous leaves and clusters of white or yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in harsh, cold environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its compact growth habit and frost-resistant properties make it well-suited for alpine and tundra ecosystems.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Potentilla fruticosa and Potentilla anglica.</p>
