                    <h1>Perula</h1>
<p>Perula, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a member of the Rutaceae family, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits. Its ornamental value is largely due to its unique foliage, though it is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The tree thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth.</p>
