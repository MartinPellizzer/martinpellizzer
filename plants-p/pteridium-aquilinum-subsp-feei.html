<p>Pteridium aquilinum subsp.</p>
<p>feei, commonly known as the Chinese bracken, is a fern species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of fern reproductive structures.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the more widely distributed P. aquilinum.</p>
