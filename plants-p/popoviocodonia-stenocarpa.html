                    <h1>Popoviocodonia stenocarpa</h1>
<p>Popoviocodonia stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited popoviocodonia, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elongated leaves and unique, clustered inflorescences that produce tiny, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive, woody fruits that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. It is adapted to grow in specific, often nutrient-poor soils, typically in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
