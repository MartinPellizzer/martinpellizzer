                    <h1>Panicum flexile</h1>
<p>Panicum flexile, commonly known as silky panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, silver-blue foliage and slender, arching stems that often form a low, mat-like growth. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that give it a distinctive, airy appearance, especially in late summer and early fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
