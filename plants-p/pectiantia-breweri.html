<p>Pectiantia breweri, commonly known as the Breweri's pectinplant, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its unique botanical features, such as its specialized root system and succulent leaves, enable it to thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Pectiantia breweri is considered endangered and is protected in several states.</p>
