                    <h1>Plazia conferta</h1>
<p>Plazia conferta, commonly known as the dense plazia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are densely packed. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of violet and blue, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Plazia conferta is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
