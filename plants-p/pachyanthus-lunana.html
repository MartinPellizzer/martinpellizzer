<p>Pachyanthus lunana, commonly known as the moonflower of Lunana, is a rare and striking plant native to the Himalayan region of Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its luminous blossoms. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, typically between 2,500 and 3,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pachyanthus lunana is considered an endangered species.</p>
