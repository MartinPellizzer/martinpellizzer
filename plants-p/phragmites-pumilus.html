                    <h1>Phragmites pumilus</h1>
<p>Phragmites pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf reed, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers during the summer months. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to spread rapidly and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>While it can be invasive in some regions, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
