<p>Polystichum cuspidatum, commonly known as the prickly shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are composed of lance-shaped pinnae with sharp, spiny tips, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in rows along the pinnae.</p>
