                    <h1>Pinus divaricata var. hendersonii</h1>
<p>Pinus divaricata var. hendersonii, commonly known as Henderson's lace pine, is a rare and ornamental variant of the lacebark pine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely textured, fibrous bark that peels in thin, papery strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces long, slender needles that are typically blue-green in color, and it bears cones that are often reddish-brown and persist on the tree for several years. Native to the southern United States, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and slow growth rate make it a prized specimen in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
