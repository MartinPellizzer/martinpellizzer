<p>Pinguicula vulgaris var. sixtina, commonly known as the Sixtina butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, sticky leaves that trap small insects. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and requires high humidity to flourish.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to absorb nutrients from captured prey, supplementing its nutrient-poor environment.</p>
