                    <h1>Prunus sogdiana var. atrata</h1>
<p>Prunus sogdiana var. atrata, commonly known as the black cherry of the Tian Shan, is a rare and ancient species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
