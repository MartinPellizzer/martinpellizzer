                    <h1>Puya tillii</h1>
<p>Puya tillii, commonly known as the Chilean torch, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is a member of the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach heights of up to 10 feet. The plant features broad, strap-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a dense, protective layer around the central flower spike. Puya tillii produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
