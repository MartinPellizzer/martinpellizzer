                    <h1>Petrosedum rupestre</h1>
<p>Petrosedum rupestre, commonly known as stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically in late spring or early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>Petrosedum rupestre is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion on rocky slopes.</p>
