                    <h1>Pteroceras insularum</h1>
<p>Pteroceras insularum, commonly known as the island horned lichen, is a unique species of lichen that thrives in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, branched thallus with small, horn-like structures that give it its common name. This lichen is typically found on rocky surfaces in humid, temperate regions. Its growth is slow, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
