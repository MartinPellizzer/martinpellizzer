                    <h1>Phrygia nigra</h1>
<p>Phrygia nigra, commonly known as the black phrygia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black foliage and its unique, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and somewhat succulent.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Phrygia nigra is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
