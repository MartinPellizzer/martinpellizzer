                    <h1>Prunus mume var. pleiocarpa</h1>
<p>Prunus mume var. pleiocarpa, commonly known as the multi-fruited Chinese plum, is a variant of the Japanese apricot.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique ability to produce multiple fruits on a single branch, a trait that makes it distinct from typical Prunus mume varieties. The plant is native to China and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its flowers are typically white or pink, followed by small, aromatic fruits that ripen in late spring.</p>
<p>The botanical interest of this variety lies in its unusual fruiting pattern and potential for ornamental and culinary use.</p>
