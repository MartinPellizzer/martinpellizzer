                    <h1>Pieris villosa</h1>
<p>Pieris villosa, commonly known as the hairy pieris, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ovate, hairy leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and seasonal blooms, though it is toxic to livestock.</p>
