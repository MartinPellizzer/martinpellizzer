<p>Polysphaeria arbuscula, commonly known as the hairy polypore, is a species of bracket fungus that belongs to the family Polyporaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous, and often hairy texture on its cap surface. This fungus typically grows on decaying wood, particularly in temperate and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing surface, or hymenium, is located on the underside of the cap and is covered with small, rounded pores.</p>
<p>Polysphaeria arbuscula is often found in association with hardwood trees, contributing to the decomposition of organic matter in forest ecosystems.</p>
