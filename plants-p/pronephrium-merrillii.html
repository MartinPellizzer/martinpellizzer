                    <h1>Pronephrium merrillii</h1>
<p>Pronephrium merrillii, commonly known as the Hainan cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the Hainan Island in China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of feathery, compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow cones that are typically borne on the stem rather than on branches. Pronephrium merrillii is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
