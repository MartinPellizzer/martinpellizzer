                    <h1>Potamogeton × burtonii</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × burtonii, commonly known as the hybrid water milfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Potamogeton perfoliatus and Potamogeton praelatus. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, green flowers that are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential can lead to dense growth that may alter water quality and outcompete native species.</p>
