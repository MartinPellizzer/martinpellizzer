                    <h1>Peutalis palustris</h1>
<p>Peutalis palustris, commonly known as the marsh peat moss, is a species of peat moss that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, spongy, and fibrous growth form, which contributes to the formation of peat in acidic, waterlogged soils. This plant is typically found in bogs, fens, and other moist habitats across temperate regions. It plays a crucial role in carbon sequestration and soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and unique adaptations make it an important component of peatland ecosystems.</p>
