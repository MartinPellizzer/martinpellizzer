<p>Pyrus × lobata, commonly known as the hybrid pear, is a deciduous tree that belongs to the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Pyrus communis (European pear) and Pyrus pyrifolia (Japanese pear), resulting in a plant that combines traits from both parents. The tree typically grows to a height of 5–10 meters, featuring broad, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. Its flowers are white and clustered in corymbs, and it produces edible fruit that is often used for culinary purposes.</p>
