<p>Populus lasiocarpa, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive bark, which is thick, scaly, and often whitish in color, providing protection against wildfires and extreme temperatures. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife species. Its foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green and arranged in spirals along the branches.</p>
<p>Populus lasiocarpa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in high-altitude environments.</p>
