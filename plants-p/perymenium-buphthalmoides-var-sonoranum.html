                    <h1>Perymenium buphthalmoides var. sonoranum</h1>
<p>Perymenium buphthalmoides var. sonoranum, commonly known as the Sonoran false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods that aid in wind dispersal. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which provide additional protection against intense sunlight and drought.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils, making it a characteristic component of desert ecosystems.</p>
