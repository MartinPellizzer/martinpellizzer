                    <h1>Pagiantha peninsularis var. breviloba</h1>
<p>Pagiantha peninsularis var. breviloba, commonly known as the narrow-lobed pagiantha, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the Peninsular region of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a compact rosette formation. The plant produces delicate, pale yellow flowers during the dry season, which are clustered in small inflorescences. Its botanical features include a short, fibrous root system and a succulent stem that stores water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
