<p>Polypodium pseudoserratum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall-rue, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are bipinnate, with finely divided segments that give it a lacy appearance.</p>
<p>Polypodium pseudoserratum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
