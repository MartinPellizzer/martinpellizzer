                    <h1>Phyllactis macrorhiza</h1>
<p>Phyllactis macrorhiza, commonly known as the large-rooted bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to certain regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures used to trap small aquatic prey. The plant has a root system that can grow quite extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in muddy or aquatic environments. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the stems bear the specialized bladders.</p>
<p>This species thrives in wetland habitats and plays a role in nutrient cycling within its ecosystem.</p>
