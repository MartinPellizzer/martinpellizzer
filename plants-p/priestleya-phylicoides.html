                    <h1>Priestleya phylicoides</h1>
<p>Priestleya phylicoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its modified stems and roots for photosynthesis and nutrient absorption. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a delicate, orchid-like appearance.</p>
<p>Priestleya phylicoides is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a valuable indicator of ecosystem health.</p>
