                    <h1>Pinus morrisonicola</h1>
<p>Pinus morrisonicola, commonly known as the Morrison Island pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian island of Molokai.</p>
<p>This coniferous tree is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and long, needle-like leaves that grow in bundles of five. It produces cones that are typically reddish-brown in color and contain winged seeds dispersed by wind. The plant thrives in coastal habitats and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native region.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
