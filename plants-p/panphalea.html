                    <h1>Panphalea</h1>
<p>Panphalea, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their compact rosettes of velvety, waxy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and often have a slight sheen, while the flowers bloom in clusters at the stem's apex. Panphalea species are popular as houseplants due to their ability to thrive in low-light conditions and their ornamental value.</p>
<p>They are also valued for their ability to produce offsets, making them relatively easy to propagate.</p>
