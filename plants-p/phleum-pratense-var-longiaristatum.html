                    <h1>Phleum pratense var. longiaristatum</h1>
<p>Phleum pratense var. longiaristatum, commonly known as the long-leaved timothy grass, is a variant of the timothy grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, grass-like leaves that are typically longer and more slender than those of the standard Phleum pratense. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers that are often wind-pollinated, a common trait among grasses. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its role in ecological habitats and as a forage crop for livestock.</p>
