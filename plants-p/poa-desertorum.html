                    <h1>Poa desertorum</h1>
<p>Poa desertorum, commonly known as the desert bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage that reflects its adaptation to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, Poa desertorum plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in desert ecosystems.</p>
