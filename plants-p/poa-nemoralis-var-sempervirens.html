<p>Poa nemoralis var. sempervirens, commonly known as the evergreen bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
