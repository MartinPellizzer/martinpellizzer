                    <h1>Potentilla opaca var. granitica</h1>
<p>Potentilla opaca var. granitica, commonly known as the granite cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to alpine and rocky regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils, often found on rock outcrops and slopes. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a powdery waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult terrain.</p>
