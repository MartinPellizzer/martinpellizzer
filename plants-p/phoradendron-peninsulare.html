<p>Phoradendron peninsulare, commonly known as the Florida flamevine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The Florida flamevine is often found growing on trees in moist, shaded environments, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
