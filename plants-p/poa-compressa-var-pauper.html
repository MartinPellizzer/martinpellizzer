<p>Poa compressa var. pauper, commonly known as the poor grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its short, compact stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
