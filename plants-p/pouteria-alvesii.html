                    <h1>Pouteria alvesii</h1>
<p>Pouteria alvesii, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and showy white flowers. The tree produces a fruit known as a "siriguela," which contains the edible seeds used to make Brazil nuts. Its growth is slow, and it can live for centuries, making it a keystone species in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its economic importance in the global nut trade.</p>
