<p>Azorean cherry, scientifically known as Prunus lusitanica subsp. azorica, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Azores islands in Portugal. This shrub or small tree is characterized by its dark green leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in the humid and temperate climate of the volcanic soils found in the Azorean highlands. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, the Azorean cherry is considered a symbol of the unique biodiversity of the region. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this species from habitat loss and environmental threats.</p>
