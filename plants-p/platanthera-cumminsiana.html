                    <h1>Platanthera cumminsiana</h1>
<p>Platanthera cumminsiana, commonly known as the Cummins' lady's-tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and long, spiraled spikes of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands, often in areas with rich, organic soil. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is crucial for its survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
