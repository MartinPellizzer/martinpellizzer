<p>Potentilla nivea subsp.</p>
<p>arenosa, commonly known as the sandstone cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
