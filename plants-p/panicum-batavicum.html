<p>Panicum batavicum, commonly known as Batavian millet, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, clustered spikelets that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces wind-pollinated flowers, which contribute to its reproductive strategy in open habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, Panicum batavicum is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
