                    <h1>Plagiochloa brachystachya</h1>
<p>Plagiochloa brachystachya, commonly known as the short-stemmed flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or clumps. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. Its inflorescence consists of a narrow panicle with closely spaced spikelets, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and low maintenance, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
