<p>Pleurocoffea boiviniana, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil, and thrives in humid, tropical environments. Its flowers are highly fragrant and attract various pollinators, including bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
