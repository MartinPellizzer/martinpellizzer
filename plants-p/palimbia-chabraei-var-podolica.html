<p>Palimbia chabraei var. podolica, commonly known as the Podolic palm, is a rare and unique variant of the Palimbia chabraei species.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. This plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and the plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
