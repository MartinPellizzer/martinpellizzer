                    <h1>Pouteria costata</h1>
<p>Pouteria costata, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces hard, woody fruits that contain edible seeds, which are the source of the commercially valuable Brazil nut. The botanical features of Pouteria costata include its ability to thrive in humid, nutrient-rich soils and its role as a keystone species in the rainforest ecosystem.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance is further highlighted by its dependency on specific pollinators and seed dispersers.</p>
