<p>Phaeanthus nutans, commonly known as the nodding phaeanthus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that hang in clusters, giving it its "nodding" appearance. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions.</p>
