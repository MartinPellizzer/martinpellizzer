<p>Polypodium bamlerianum, commonly known as the Bamler's water fern, is a species of polypodiaceae found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are usually pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous cover.</p>
