                    <h1>Panicum comosum</h1>
<p>Panicum comosum, commonly known as foxtail millet, is a warm-season grass native to Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, bristly inflorescences that resemble a fox's tail, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spikelet-like flowers that mature into hard, triangular grains. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy crop in arid regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it valuable for both forage and grain production.</p>
