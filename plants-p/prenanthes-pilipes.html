                    <h1>Prenanthes pilipes</h1>
<p>Prenanthes pilipes, commonly known as the hairy water shield, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its floating leaves with a waxy, hairy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by a spadix, typical of the arum family. Its roots are often submerged, anchoring it in shallow water while absorbing nutrients from the aquatic environment.</p>
<p>Prenanthes pilipes plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic insect populations and maintaining wetland biodiversity.</p>
