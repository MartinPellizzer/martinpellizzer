<p>Polyspora gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's polypody, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizome is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
