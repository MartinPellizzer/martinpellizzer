<p>Poa diaphora var. diaphora, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in suitable environments.</p>
<p>It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
