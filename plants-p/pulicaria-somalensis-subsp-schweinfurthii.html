<p>Pulicaria somalensis subsp.</p>
<p>schweinfurthii, commonly known as the Somali pulicaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of Somalia. It features wiry, branching stems covered with fine, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in compact clusters, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which provide additional protection against desiccation.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, making it a characteristic component of dry, coastal and inland habitats.</p>
