<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while also storing nutrients.</p>
<p>Polystichum guadalupense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its dense, evergreen foliage.</p>
