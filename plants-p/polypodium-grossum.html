<p>Polypodium grossum, commonly known as the giant cliff fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forest canopies or rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor it to its host, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium grossum plays an important ecological role in tropical ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
