<p>Polypodium vulgare var. sinuatum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a perennial fern native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a creeping rhizome with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into a bipinnate structure. The fronds are dark green, leathery, and have a distinctive sinuous margin, giving it its botanical name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover.</p>
