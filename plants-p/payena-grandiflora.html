<p>Payena grandiflora, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to central and western Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces showy, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and musical instruments.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now listed as an endangered species.</p>
