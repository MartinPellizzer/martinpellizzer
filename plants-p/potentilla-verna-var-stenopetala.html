<p>Potentilla verna var. stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of whitish hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in alpine gardens.</p>
