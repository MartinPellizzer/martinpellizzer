                    <h1>Plectritis anomala</h1>
<p>Plectritis anomala, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is native to western North America and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
