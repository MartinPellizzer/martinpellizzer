                    <h1>Phreatia loriae</h1>
<p>Phreatia loriae, commonly known as the Loria's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with elongated, white or pale green pseudobulbs and narrow, strap-like leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green to white in color, often with a subtle pinkish hue. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is typically found growing on tree trunks or branches in the canopy.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Phreatia loriae is considered a conservation concern.</p>
