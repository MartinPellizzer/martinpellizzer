<p>Passovia lobaterae, commonly known as the mountain mistflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Passovia lobaterae is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
