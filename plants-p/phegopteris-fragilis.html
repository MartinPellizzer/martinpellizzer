                    <h1>Phegopteris fragilis</h1>
<p>Phegopteris fragilis, commonly known as brittle brake, is a fern species belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically divided into multiple segments. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released into the air for dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its fragile appearance is reflected in its common name, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
