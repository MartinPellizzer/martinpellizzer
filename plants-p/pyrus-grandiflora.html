<p>Pyrus grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring showy white to pink flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree produces small, sweet-scented fruits that are edible but not as widely cultivated as other pear varieties. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin.</p>
<p>Pyrus grandiflora is often grown in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively cold-hardy, making it suitable for temperate climates.</p>
