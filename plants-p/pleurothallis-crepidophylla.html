<p>Pleurothallis crepidophylla, commonly known as the cup-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, cup-shaped leaves that help retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding a subtle beauty to its natural environment. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
