                    <h1>Poa pumilio</h1>
<p>Poa pumilio, commonly known as the "snow grass," is a low-growing perennial grass native to the alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Poa pumilio plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife.</p>
