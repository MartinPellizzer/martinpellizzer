<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. The plant features broad, floating leaves with a waxy surface that helps repel water, and its flowers are usually white or pale pink, blooming in the early morning. Its root system supports the growth of various aquatic organisms, contributing to the ecosystem's biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to thrive in still or slow-moving water makes it an important component of wetland environments.</p>
