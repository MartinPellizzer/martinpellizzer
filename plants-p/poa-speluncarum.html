                    <h1>Poa speluncarum</h1>
<p>Poa speluncarum, commonly known as the cave bentgrass, is a rare and specialized grass species that thrives in dark, humid environments such as caves and rock crevices.</p>
<p>It is adapted to low light conditions and has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, which is a common reproductive strategy among grasses. Its root system is dense and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in nutrient-poor substrates.</p>
<p>Poa speluncarum is considered an indicator species for subterranean ecosystems due to its unique ecological niche.</p>
