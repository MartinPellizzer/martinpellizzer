                    <h1>Poecilopteris hookeriana</h1>
<p>Poecilopteris hookeriana, commonly known as Hooker's water fern, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that resemble those of modern-day water ferns. This plant thrived in wet, swampy environments during the Carboniferous and early Permian periods. Its fossilized remains are often found in coal deposits, indicating its widespread distribution in ancient tropical regions.</p>
<p>The structure of its fronds provides valuable insights into the evolution of early vascular plants.</p>
