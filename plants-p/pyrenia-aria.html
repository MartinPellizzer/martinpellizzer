<p>Pyrenia aria, commonly known as the common pyrenia, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus that is typically light green to yellowish in color.

It is often found growing on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate forest environments.</p>
<p>Pyrenia aria is known for its slow growth and is used as an indicator species for assessing air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
