                            <h1>Prunus Arborea Var. Stipulacea</h1>
<p>Stipulate cherry, scientifically known as Prunus arborea var. stipulacea, is a unique and lesser-known member of the Rosaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its most distinctive feature is the presence of stipules—small leaf-like structures at the base of its leaves. While not as widely cultivated as other cherry species, it holds ecological and horticultural value. This article explores its characteristics, habitat, and potential for future cultivation.</p>
