                    <h1>Persea macrantha var. brevifolia</h1>
<p>Persea macrantha var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved avocado, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves that are shorter and broader than those of the typical Persea macrantha. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by pear-shaped fruits. The fruit's skin is smooth and turns from green to yellow when ripe, and it contains a single large seed.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential as a fruit-bearing plant in suitable climates.</p>
