<p>Poa keysseri subsp.</p>
<p>saruwagetica, commonly known as the Saruwagetica bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with bisexual flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous grasslands and alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
