                    <h1>Paspalum portoricense</h1>
<p>Paspalum portoricense, commonly known as the Caribbean grass or coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in coastal and saline environments, making it an important component of dune vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience to salt and wind, it is often used in ecological restoration projects along shorelines.</p>
