<p>Phragmites communis var. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy reed, is a variant of the common reed that is characterized by its hairy stems and dense growth habit.</p>
<p>It is a tall, perennial grass that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences that are wind-pollinated. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive in certain environments.</p>
