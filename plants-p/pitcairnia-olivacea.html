                    <h1>Pitcairnia olivacea</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia olivacea, commonly known as the velvet leaf pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety rosette of dark green, overlapping leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, often in a dramatic display. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is commonly cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
