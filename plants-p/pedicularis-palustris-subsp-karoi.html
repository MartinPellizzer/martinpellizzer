<p>Pedicularis palustris subsp.</p>
<p>karoi, commonly known as the bog lousewort, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in northern regions. It is characterized by its showy, red-orange flowers that resemble small lice, hence its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in acidic, peaty soils and thrives in moist, open environments. It has slender stems and lance-shaped leaves, with the flowers clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in bogs and fens, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of these unique wetland ecosystems.</p>
