                    <h1>Potentilla anserina f. tuberosa</h1>
<p>Potentilla anserina f. tuberosa, commonly known as the silverweed or tuberous silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. It has a creeping growth habit and often forms dense mats, making it suitable for ground cover in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>The tuberous roots of this plant are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
