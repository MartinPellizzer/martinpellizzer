                    <h1>Piper conditum</h1>
<p>Piper conditum, commonly known as the pepper plant, is a flowering vine native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Piperaceae and is characterized by its small, green, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that eventually develop into the familiar red or black peppercorns used as a spice. Its botanical structure includes a woody stem with adventitious roots and aerial roots that help it climb.</p>
<p>The fruit, a drupe, contains the aromatic seed that is the source of black, white, and green pepper.</p>
