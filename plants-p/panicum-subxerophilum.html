                    <h1>Panicum subxerophilum</h1>
<p>Panicum subxerophilum, commonly known as the desert panicgrass, is a drought-tolerant grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It possesses narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to minimize water loss through transpiration. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This species is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
