                <h1>Pneumatopteris ligulata</h1>
<p>Pneumatopteris ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across Asia and the Pacific. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The plant's intricate leaf structure and elegant appearance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
