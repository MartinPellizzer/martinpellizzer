                    <h1>Pinus dalatensis var. bidoupensis</h1>
<p>Pinus dalatensis var. bidoupensis, commonly known as the Bidoup Pine, is a rare and endemic coniferous species native to the Central Highlands of Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are typically 5 to 7 centimeters long. The plant produces cones that are woody and often remain attached to the tree for several years. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often found in montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
