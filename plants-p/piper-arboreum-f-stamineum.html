                    <h1>Piper arboreum f. stamineum</h1>
<p>Piper arboreum f. stamineum, commonly known as the white pepper plant, is a variant of the Piper arboreum species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced floral structures, with stamen-like structures replacing the typical female flowers, leading to the production of white, peppercorn-like berries. The plant is cultivated for its seeds, which are dried and used as a spice. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it distinct from the standard Piper arboreum, which produces black pepper.</p>
