<p>Pseudorhipsalis ramulosa, commonly known as the silver star cactus, is a succulent plant native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It features a branched, shrub-like structure with short, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white to grayish-blue hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Pseudorhipsalis ramulosa is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and ornamental appeal.</p>
