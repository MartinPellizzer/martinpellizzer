                    <h1>Polybotrya sessilisora</h1>
<p>Polybotrya sessilisora, commonly known as the sessile fronded fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stalk without a petiole. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
