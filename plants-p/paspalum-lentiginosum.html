<p>Paspalum lentiginosum, commonly known as the blackgrass or velvetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, often forming dense mats near water bodies. The plant has dark green, narrow leaves with a distinctive velvety texture, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in groups. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by water or wind.</p>
<p>Paspalum lentiginosum is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
