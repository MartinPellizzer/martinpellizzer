                    <h1>Parodia idiosa</h1>
<p>Parodia idiosa, commonly known as the "Cactus of the Desert," is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its stems are ribbed and capable of storing water, making it highly adapted to harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>Parodia idiosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
