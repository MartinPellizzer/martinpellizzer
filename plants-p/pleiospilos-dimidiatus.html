                    <h1>Pleiospilos dimidiatus</h1>
<p>Pleiospilos dimidiatus, commonly known as the two-lobed stone plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear small, yellowish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
