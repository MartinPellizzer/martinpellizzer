<p>Pocockia kotschyi, commonly known as the desert stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Pocockia kotschyi is also notable for its ability to propagate through both seeds and vegetative means.</p>
