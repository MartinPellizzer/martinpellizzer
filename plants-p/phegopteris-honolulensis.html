<p>Phegopteris honolulensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian water fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found only on the island of Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in wetlands or along streams. Its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its fronds, and it plays a significant role in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
