                    <h1>Pedicularis limnogena</h1>
<p>Pedicularis limnogena, commonly known as the water hussy, is a rare and specialized member of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. This species is typically found in wet, boggy habitats, often near water bodies in mountainous regions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred shape that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in many areas.</p>
