                    <h1>Potentilla reptans var. trifoliata</h1>
<p>Potentilla reptans var. trifoliata, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is composed of three leaflets, which distinguishes it from the typical two-leaflet structure of the species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in garden settings.</p>
