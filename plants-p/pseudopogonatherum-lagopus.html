<p>Pseudopogonatherum lagopus, commonly known as the mountain grass or bog grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense clumps, with slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, wind-pollinated flowers, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Pseudopogonatherum lagopus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native wetland habitats.</p>
