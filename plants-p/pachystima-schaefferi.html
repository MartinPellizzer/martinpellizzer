<p>Pachystima schaefferi, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It has small, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Pachystima schaefferi is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
