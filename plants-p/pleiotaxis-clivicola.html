<p>Pleiotaxis clivicola, commonly known as the cliff-loving pleiotaxis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and succulent leaves that store water, aiding in survival in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices and absorb nutrients from limited soil.</p>
<p>Pleiotaxis clivicola is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found growing on cliffs or rocky outcrops.</p>
