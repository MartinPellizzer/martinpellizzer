                    <h1>Parasitaxus</h1>
<p>Parasitaxus, commonly known as the Indian yew, is a rare and unique plant that exhibits both parasitic and autotrophic traits.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Taxaceae and is characterized by its woody, evergreen structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with its host, drawing nutrients through specialized roots while also contributing to the ecosystem. Its small, scale-like leaves and cone-bearing structure are adaptations to its specific ecological niche.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in forest ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant evolution.</p>
