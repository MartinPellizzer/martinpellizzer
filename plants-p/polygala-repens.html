<p>Polygala repens, commonly known as the creeping milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, usually green or yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically visited by insects. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and often covered with fine hairs.</p>
<p>Polygala repens is adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
