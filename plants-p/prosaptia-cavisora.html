                    <h1>Prosaptia cavisora</h1>
<p>Prosaptia cavisora, commonly known as the hollow-leaf orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and uniquely shaped leaves that curve inward, creating a hollow appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often clustered in loose inflorescences. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, shaded environments where it thrives.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Prosaptia cavisora is considered an endangered species.</p>
