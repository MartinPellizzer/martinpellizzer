                    <h1>Platantheroides ligulata</h1>
<p>Platantheroides ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and bog habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear a single spike of small, greenish-white flowers with elongated petals. The plant has a fibrous root system and possesses a specialized mycorrhizal relationship with fungi to aid in nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often emerging from the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Platantheroides ligulata is typically found in acidic, nutrient-poor environments and is considered an indicator species for undisturbed wetlands.</p>
