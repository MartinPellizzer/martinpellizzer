<p>Paulownia tomentosa var. tomentosa, commonly known as the empress tree or royal paulownia, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rapid growth, reaching heights of up to 30 meters, and its distinctive heart-shaped leaves that are soft and hairy. The tree produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in clusters, typically in late spring, which are pale purple to white in color.
