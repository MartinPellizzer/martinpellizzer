                    <h1>Potamogeton pectinatus f. potensus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton pectinatus f. potensus, commonly known as the broad-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant characterized by its broad, elongated leaves that are often ribbed and have a waxy surface.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often submerged or just at the water's surface. Its rhizomes form dense mats that can stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to water clarity and supporting biodiversity.</p>
