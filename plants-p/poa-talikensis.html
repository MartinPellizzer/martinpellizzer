<p>Poa talikensis, commonly known as the talikensis grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Poa talikensis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for herbivores in its native ecosystems.</p>
