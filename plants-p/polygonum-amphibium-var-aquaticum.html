<p>Polygonum amphibium var. aquaticum, commonly known as the water knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
