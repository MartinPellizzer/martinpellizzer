<p>Polypodium rockii, commonly known as the Chinese wall fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact fronds that form a mat-like structure. The plant typically grows on rocks or trees, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of moss-like growth, which helps in moisture retention.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year.</p>
