                            <h1>Pyrus Khasiana</h1>
<p>Khasi pear, scientifically known as Pyrus khasiana, is a unique fruit-bearing plant native to the northeastern region of India. This species thrives in the humid subtropical climate of the Khasi Hills, where it has adapted to the region's rich biodiversity. The Khasi pear is valued not only for its sweet and aromatic fruit but also for its cultural significance among the local communities. It plays an important role in both traditional agriculture and local cuisine. Despite its importance, the plant remains relatively underexplored in global horticultural research.</p>
