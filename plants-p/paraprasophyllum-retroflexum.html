                    <h1>Paraprasophyllum retroflexum</h1>
<p>Paraprasophyllum retroflexum, commonly known as the retroflex pincushion orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, compact growth habit and specialized root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, recurved lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
