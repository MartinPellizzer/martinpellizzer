                    <h1>Prasophyllum elatum var. muelleri</h1>
<p>Prasophyllum elatum var. muelleri, commonly known as the large green leek orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves and an upright spike of greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to wet, boggy environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are often visited by insects such as flies and beetles, which play a role in its pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
