                    <h1>Polyachyrus tarapacanus</h1>
<p>Polyachyrus tarapacanus, commonly known as the Atacama spurge, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its succulent stems and lobed leaves adapted to extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ability to survive in nutrient-poor, saline soils makes it a unique example of desert flora.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens.</p>
