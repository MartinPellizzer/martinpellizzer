                    <h1>Pinguicula stolonifera</h1>
<p>Pinguicula stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest insects. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It reproduces both vegetatively through stolons and sexually via seeds.</p>
<p>Its adaptations make it well-suited for nutrient-poor environments, where it supplements its diet with captured prey.</p>
