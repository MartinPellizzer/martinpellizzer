                    <h1>Polyspora cuongii</h1>
<p>Polyspora cuongii, commonly known as the Cuong's polypore, is a rare fungal species belonging to the family Polyporaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, woody basidiocarp with a sponge-like pore structure, which is typical of polypores. The fruiting body is usually found on decaying hardwoods, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing surface is smooth and often exhibits a pale to dark brown coloration.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Polyspora cuongii is of interest to mycologists studying fungal biodiversity and ecosystem interactions.</p>
