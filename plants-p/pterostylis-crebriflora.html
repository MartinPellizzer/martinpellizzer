<p>Pterostylis crebriflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered greenhood, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, hood-like flower spike that typically ranges from 30 to 60 centimeters in height. The plant produces numerous small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered closely together, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, which involves the mimicry of female wasps to attract male pollinators.</p>
