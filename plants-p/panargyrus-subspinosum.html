                    <h1>Panargyrus subspinosum</h1>
<p>Panargyrus subspinosum, commonly known as the spiny panargyrus, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, branched stems and compound leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, where it has adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are often finely divided and covered in fine hairs, providing some protection against herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
