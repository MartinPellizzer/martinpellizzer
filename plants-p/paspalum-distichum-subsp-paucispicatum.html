<p>Paspalum distichum subsp.</p>
<p>paucispicatum, commonly known as the slender paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to submerged soil conditions.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are often extensive, allowing it to form dense mats that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in wetland habitats and its potential use in phytoremediation.</p>
