                    <h1>Pedilonum neoebudanum</h1>
<p>Pedilonum neoebudanum, commonly known as the shimmering starbloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features striking, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly in the dark, a unique adaptation for attracting night-flying pollinators. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with waxy, broad leaves that reflect sunlight during the day. Its flowers bloom only once a year, typically during the late spring, and emit a subtle, sweet fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance and aesthetic appeal, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
