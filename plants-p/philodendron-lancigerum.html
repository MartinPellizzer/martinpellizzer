                    <h1>Philodendron lancigerum</h1>
<p>Philodendron lancigerum, commonly known as the creeping philodendron, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with cream or white markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its vigorous growth habit makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets or as a climbing plant in greenhouses.</p>
