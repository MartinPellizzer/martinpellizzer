                    <h1>Pandanus decumbens</h1>
<p>Pandanus decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by spiky, fibrous fruits. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and for thatching, while the plant itself is adapted to coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>Pandanus decumbens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
