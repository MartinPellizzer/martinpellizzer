                    <h1>Psammagrostis</h1>
<p>Psammagrostis, commonly known as sand grass, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its adaptation to arid and sandy environments, with species often found in coastal dunes and inland deserts. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. Psammagrostis species are often used for dune stabilization due to their ability to thrive in harsh, wind-blown conditions.</p>
<p>Their ecological importance lies in their role in preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
