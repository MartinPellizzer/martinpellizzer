<p>Platanus vulgaris var. liquidambarifolia, commonly known as the Chinese sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by spherical, spiky fruits. Its bark is thick and flaky, often peeling in a distinctive manner.</p>
