                    <h1>Potamogeton × pseudofriesii</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × pseudofriesii, commonly known as the hybrid water milfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Potamogeton crispus and Potamogeton natans, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to form dense stands, it can impact water quality and aquatic biodiversity.</p>
