<p>Pterogastra, commonly known as the "butterfly orchid," is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their intricate, often showy flowers that resemble butterflies, with specialized structures for pollination. They are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Pterogastra species have pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and their roots are adapted for epiphytic growth on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>The flowers exhibit a unique structure with a labellum that serves as a landing platform for pollinators.</p>
