                    <h1>Phyllanthus pseudocicca</h1>
<p>Phyllanthus pseudocicca, commonly known as the narrow-leaf phyllanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent-like leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often in disturbed or arid environments. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts.</p>
