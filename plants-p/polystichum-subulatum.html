<p>Polystichum subulatum, commonly known as the needle-leaf woodfern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a compact, upright growth habit with dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are finely divided into needle-like segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Polystichum subulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its elegant foliage.</p>
