                    <h1>Phippsiomeles matudae</h1>
<p>Phippsiomeles matudae, commonly known as the Matudas's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients from the host while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are adapted for dispersal by birds. Its leaves are usually scale-like, reducing water loss in the humid, high-altitude environment where it thrives.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and specific habitat requirements, Phippsiomeles matudae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
