                    <h1>Pteris pseudowulaiensis</h1>
<p>Pteris pseudowulaiensis, commonly known as the Wulai spleenwort, is a fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
