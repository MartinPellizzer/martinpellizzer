                    <h1>Potentilla grandiflora var. genuina</h1>
<p>Potentilla grandiflora var. genuina, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features silver-gray foliage with slightly hairy leaves, which help it withstand cold and arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
