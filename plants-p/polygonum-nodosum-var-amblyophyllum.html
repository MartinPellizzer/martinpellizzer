<p>Polygonum nodosum var. amblyophyllum, commonly known as the slender knotweed, is a variant of the knotweed genus characterized by its upright growth habit and slender stems.</p>
<p>It typically features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red in color, which appear in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
