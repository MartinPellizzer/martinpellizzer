                    <h1>Piptomeris sternbergiana</h1>
<p>Piptomeris sternbergiana, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of thick, fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in poor soil conditions and withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Piptomeris sternbergiana plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
