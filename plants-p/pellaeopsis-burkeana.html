<p>Pellaeopsis burkeana, commonly known as the Burke's spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates.</p>
