                    <h1>Piper palustre</h1>
<p>Piper palustre, commonly known as swamp pepper or water pepper, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along stream edges.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to aquatic and semi-aquatic environments.</p>
