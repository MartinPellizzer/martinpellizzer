<p>Portulaca umbraticola subsp.</p>
<p>lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf moss rose, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in regions with hot, dry climates.</p>
