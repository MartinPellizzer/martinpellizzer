                    <h1>Potentilla cinerea var. praetutiana</h1>
<p>Potentilla cinerea var. praetutiana, commonly known as the gray cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
