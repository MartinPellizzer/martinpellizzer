<p>Pseudohemipilia robbrechtiana, commonly known as the Robbrecht's pseudohemipilia, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent lip structures, which are typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
