                    <h1>Pulicaria undulata f. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Pulicaria undulata f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, gray-green, woolly leaves that are typically narrow and undulating, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
