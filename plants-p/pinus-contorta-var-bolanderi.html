                    <h1>Pinus contorta var. bolanderi</h1>
<p>Pinus contorta var. bolanderi, commonly known as the Bolander lodgepole pine, is a subspecies of the lodgepole pine native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dense, needle-like foliage. This plant typically grows in high-elevation areas, including subalpine and alpine zones, where it thrives in cold, dry conditions. Its cones are serotinous, meaning they remain closed until exposed to heat, such as from a forest fire, which aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>The Bolander lodgepole pine plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its harsh habitat.</p>
