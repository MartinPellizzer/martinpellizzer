<p>Portulaca arachnoides, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant has a low-growing habit, often forming dense mats on sandy or gravelly soils. Its stems are covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss and provide protection from intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Portulaca arachnoides is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
