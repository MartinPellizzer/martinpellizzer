<p>Populus suaveolens var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the sweet poplar or western trembling aspen, is a deciduous tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, light-gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are pollinated by wind. Its roots can form extensive clonal colonies through underground shoots, allowing it to spread rapidly.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in moist, temperate regions.</p>
