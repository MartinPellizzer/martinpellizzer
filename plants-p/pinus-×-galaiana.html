                    <h1>Pinus × galaiana</h1>
<p>Pinus × galaiana, commonly known as the hybrid fir, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Pinus albicaulis and Pinus muricata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its conical shape and dense foliage, typical of many fir species. The needles are usually longer and more flexible than those of its parent species, and they retain their color year-round. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>The cones are small and often persist on the tree for several years before opening.</p>
