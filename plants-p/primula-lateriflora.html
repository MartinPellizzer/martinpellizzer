<p>Primula lateriflora, commonly known as the side-flowered primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 15â€“30 centimeters and features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive yellow throat. These flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully expand, and are borne on long, slender stems.</p>
<p>Primula lateriflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
