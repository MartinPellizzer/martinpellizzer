                    <h1>Phacelia petrosa</h1>
<p>Phacelia petrosa, commonly known as desert phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Phacelia petrosa is also known for its role in supporting pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers.</p>
