<p>Phylica cryptandroides, commonly known as the ghost flame bush, is a unique shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flame-like inflorescences that appear during the cooler months, adding a striking visual contrast to the surrounding landscape. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phylica cryptandroides is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
