                    <h1>Platanthera × ophryotipuloides</h1>
<p>Platanthera × ophryotipuloides, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Platanthera falcata and Platanthera ophryoides.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and fens. The plant features tall, slender stems with showy, greenish-white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are linear and often clustered at the base, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens.</p>
