<p>Pteris pellucens, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to Asia and the Pacific islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically divided into small, lobed segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and ponds. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Pteris pellucens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and air-purifying qualities.</p>
