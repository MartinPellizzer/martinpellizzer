                    <h1>Polypodium incanum var. oblongum</h1>
<p>Polypodium incanum var. oblongum, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, thriving in humid climates. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its elongated, narrow leaves compared to other forms of Polypodium incanum.</p>
