                    <h1>Pitcairnia cosangaensis</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia cosangaensis, commonly known as the Cosangaena pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a common adaptation in its humid, high-altitude habitat. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with red and orange flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is often adorned with intricate patterns and a waxy coating, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
