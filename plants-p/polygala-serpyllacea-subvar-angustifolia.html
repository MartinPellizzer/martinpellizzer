                    <h1>Polygala serpyllacea subvar. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Polygala serpyllacea subvar. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with slender, often hairy stems that grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy surface, adapting to the harsh, dry environments it inhabits.</p>
<p>This subvariety is notable for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
