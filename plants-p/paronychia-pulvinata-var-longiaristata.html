                    <h1>Paronychia pulvinata var. longiaristata</h1>
<p>Paronychia pulvinata var. longiaristata, commonly known as the long-stalked cushion plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with fleshy, cylindrical stems that often branch at the base. The leaves are typically small, cylindrical, and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in terminal clusters, often blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to arid conditions, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
