                            <h1>Populus × Canescens</h1>
<p>Populus × canescens, commonly known as the white poplar, is a fast-growing deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is recognized for its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive white undersides that glow in the wind. This species is often used in reforestation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its role in providing habitat and supporting biodiversity makes it an important ecological asset. Despite its benefits, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
