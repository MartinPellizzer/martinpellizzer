<p>Persicaria aestiva, commonly known as summer smartweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“100 cm and features alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purplish in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters at the ends of its stems, which bloom from late summer into early autumn. Its seeds are encased in a three-lobed, bladder-like structure that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Persicaria aestiva is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in moist meadows.</p>
