<p>Polygala squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Polygala squarrosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
