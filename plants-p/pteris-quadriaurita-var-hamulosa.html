                    <h1>Pteris quadriaurita var. hamulosa</h1>
<p>Pteris quadriaurita var. hamulosa, commonly known as the hooked water fern, is a variant of the common water fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. The plant has finely divided, bi-lobed fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly serrated edge. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
