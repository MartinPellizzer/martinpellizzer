                    <h1>Phreatia morii</h1>
<p>Phreatia morii, commonly known as the Bornean ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in the canopy layer of the forest. The plant has long, slender pseudobulbs and produces delicate, white to pale pink flowers with a unique, almost translucent appearance. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Phreatia morii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
