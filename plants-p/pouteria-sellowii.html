<p>Pouteria sellowii, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing one or two large, oily seeds. These seeds, known as Brazil nuts, are highly valued for their nutritional content and are enclosed in a hard, fibrous outer shell.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
