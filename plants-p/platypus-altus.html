                    <h1>Platypus altus</h1>
<p>Platypus altus, commonly known as the mountain platypus, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has silver-green, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it a challenging species to cultivate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Platypus altus is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
