                    <h1>Potentilla nivea var. uniflora</h1>
<p>Potentilla nivea var. uniflora, commonly known as the alpine snowbell, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions.</p>
