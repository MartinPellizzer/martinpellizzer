<p>Pedicularis kangtingensis, commonly known as the Kangting lousewort, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially depends on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often resembling the shape of a louse, hence its common name. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
