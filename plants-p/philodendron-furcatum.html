The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, which are followed by red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Philodendron furcatum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
