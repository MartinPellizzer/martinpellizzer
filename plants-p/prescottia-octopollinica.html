                    <h1>Prescottia octopollinica</h1>
<p>Prescottia octopollinica, commonly known as the eight-pollen orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers with a complex structure. The plant's most distinctive feature is its eight pollinia, which are clustered in a single sac, a rare trait among orchids. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Prescottia octopollinica is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
