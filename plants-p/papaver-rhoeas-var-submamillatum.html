<p>Papaver rhoeas var. submamillatum, commonly known as the lesser poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its smaller, more delicate flowers.</p>
<p>It typically features bright red petals with a yellow center, and its blooms are often shorter and more compact than those of the standard Papaver rhoeas. This variety is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has a short flowering period in the spring and is known for its medicinal properties, including potential analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a wildflower and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
