<p>Pteris mascarenensis, commonly known as the Mascarene water fern, is a species of fern native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green and somewhat translucent. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and marshes. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Pteris mascarenensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid, tropical gardens.</p>
