                    <h1>Pinus uncinata var. pallida</h1>
<p>Pinus uncinata var. pallida, commonly known as the pale cliff pine, is a variant of the cliff pine that is characterized by its pale, often whitish or bluish-gray bark and foliage.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula and parts of northern Africa. This plant is adapted to harsh, rocky environments and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Its needle-like leaves are typically shorter and more rigid compared to other pine species, and it produces cones that are often retained on the tree for many years.</p>
<p>The pale varietal form is distinguished by its reduced chlorophyll content, giving it a distinctive appearance in its natural habitat.</p>
