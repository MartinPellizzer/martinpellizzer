<p>Phymatosorus suisha-stagnalis, commonly known as the Japanese tree fern, is a species native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds. The plant has a distinctive, rough, and fibrous trunk that resembles a tree, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
