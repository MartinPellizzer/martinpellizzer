                    <h1>Poa boliviensis</h1>
<p>Poa boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its inflorescence consists of a compact, spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets.</p>
<p>Poa boliviensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance and ability to form dense, low-growing mats.</p>
