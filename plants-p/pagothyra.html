<p>Pagothyra, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and its unique, elongated flowers that often appear in clusters. The plant typically grows on tree branches or in shaded forest understories, relying on specific host trees for support. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a delicate, almost translucent appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, Pagothyra is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
