                    <h1>Poa bulbosa var. glabriflora</h1>
<p>Poa bulbosa var. glabriflora, commonly known as the glabrous-flowered bulblet grass, is a variant of the bulblet grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Its flowers are typically glabrous, meaning they lack the usual hairy covering found in many grasses.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to rocky and dry environments, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water.</p>
