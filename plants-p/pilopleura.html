                    <h1>Pilopleura</h1>
<p>Pilopleura, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. Pilopleura species are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. They have a root system that anchors them to the substrate, and their stems are often submerged.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually reduced or absent, with the bladders being the primary photosynthetic structures.</p>
