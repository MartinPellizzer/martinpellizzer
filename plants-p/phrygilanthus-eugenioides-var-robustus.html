<p>Phrygilanthus eugenioides var. robustus, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a slow-growing, evergreen tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thick, aromatic leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by woody, spindle-shaped fruits containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for reforestation projects.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions.</p>
