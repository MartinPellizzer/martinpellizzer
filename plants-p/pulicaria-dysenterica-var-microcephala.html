                    <h1>Pulicaria dysenterica var. microcephala</h1>
<p>Pulicaria dysenterica var. microcephala, commonly known as small-headed wormwood, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It features narrow, silver-gray leaves with a fuzzy texture, adapted to conserve moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its aromatic foliage contains volatile oils, which contribute to its medicinal and pesticidal properties.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller flower heads compared to other varieties of Pulicaria.</p>
