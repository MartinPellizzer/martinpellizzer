<p>Phegopteris petrophya, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to mountainous regions in Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its spores are released from small, clustered sorus structures on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Phegopteris petrophya plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh, high-altitude environment.</p>
