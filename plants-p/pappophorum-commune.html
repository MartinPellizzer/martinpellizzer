                    <h1>Pappophorum commune</h1>
<p>Pappophorum commune, commonly known as the common pappus grass, is a small annual grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm and has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, which is a feathery structure aiding in seed distribution. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a common weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems.</p>
