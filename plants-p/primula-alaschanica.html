<p>Primula alaschanica, commonly known as the Alaska primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Alaska and western Canada.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, rocky soils at high elevations, often in alpine tundra or subalpine meadows. The plant features basal leaves that are oval to heart-shaped, with a velvety texture, and produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
