                    <h1>Polypodium decumanum</h1>
<p>Polypodium decumanum, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops, walls, and in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
