<p>Prevotia, commonly known as the "flower of the desert," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and violet. Prevotia species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>They also play a role in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
