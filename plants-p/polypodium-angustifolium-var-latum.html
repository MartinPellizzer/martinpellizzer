                    <h1>Polypodium angustifolium var. latum</h1>
<p>Polypodium angustifolium var. latum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern species native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are broader than those of the typical variety, with a dark green, glossy appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings.</p>
