                    <h1>Psilotum complanatum</h1>
<p>Psilotum complanatum, commonly known as the spike moss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of true leaves and roots, instead possessing root-like structures called rhizomes and stem-like structures known as stolons. The plant has small, scale-like structures called sporophylls that bear sporangia, which produce spores for reproduction. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices.</p>
<p>Psilotum complanatum is considered a relic of early plant evolution, showcasing features similar to its ancient ancestors.</p>
