<p>Pyrus communis var. azarifolia, commonly known as the Azarifolia pear, is a cultivar of the European pear tree characterized by its distinctive foliage and fruit.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and is known for its ornamental value, particularly during the spring when it produces clusters of white flowers. The leaves are typically larger and more elongated compared to the standard Pyrus communis, giving the plant a unique appearance. The fruit, while edible, is generally smaller and less sweet than typical pears, making it more suitable for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in mild climates.</p>
