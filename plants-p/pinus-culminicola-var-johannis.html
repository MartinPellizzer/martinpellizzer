                    <h1>Pinus culminicola var. johannis</h1>
<p>Pinus culminicola var. johannis, commonly known as the Johann's mountain pine, is a rare and endemic coniferous species native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid than those of other pine species. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing on rocky slopes or in mountainous regions. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat degradation.</p>
