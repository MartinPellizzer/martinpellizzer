                    <h1>Populus alba umbraculifera</h1>
<p>Populus alba umbraculifera, commonly known as the white poplar with a broad canopy, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white bark, which becomes fissured with age, and its heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
