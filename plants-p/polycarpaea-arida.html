                    <h1>Polycarpaea arida</h1>
<p>Polycarpaea arida, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, adapted for pollination by insects. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Polycarpaea arida plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing limited forage for certain wildlife.</p>
