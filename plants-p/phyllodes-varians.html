<p>Phyllodes varians, commonly known as the variable phyllode acacia, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its unique, flattened leaf structures called phyllodes. These phyllodes are often mistaken for leaves but function similarly, aiding in water conservation in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it adaptable to various soil types and climates.</p>
