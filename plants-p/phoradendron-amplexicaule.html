                    <h1>Phoradendron amplexicaule</h1>
<p>Phoradendron amplexicaule, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or pink berries that are often consumed by birds. It is found in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of the Americas.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves seeds being dispersed by birds that eat its berries, leading to new growth on host trees.</p>
