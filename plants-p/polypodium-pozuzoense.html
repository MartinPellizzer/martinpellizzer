                    <h1>Polypodium pozuzoense</h1>
<p>Polypodium pozuzoense, commonly known as the Pozuzo fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found growing on rocky substrates or in the understory of dense forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
