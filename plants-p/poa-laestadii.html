                    <h1>Poa laestadii</h1>
<p>Poa laestadii, commonly known as the Laestadi's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, dense tufts and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, Poa laestadii is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to high-altitude conditions.</p>
