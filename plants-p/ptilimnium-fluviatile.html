                    <h1>Ptilimnium fluviatile</h1>
<p>Ptilimnium fluviatile, commonly known as the river ptilimnium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in moist environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting various pollinators. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, stabilizing soil in marshy areas.</p>
<p>Ptilimnium fluviatile is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, saturated soils.</p>
