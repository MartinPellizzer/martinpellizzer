                    <h1>Poa annua var. ovalis</h1>
<p>Poa annua var. ovalis, commonly known as the oval annual bluegrass, is a variant of the common annual bluegrass.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, grass-like plant with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter and more compact than those of the standard Poa annua. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in lawns, gardens, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become a weed in cultivated areas.</p>
