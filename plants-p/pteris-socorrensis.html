                    <h1>Pteris socorrensis</h1>
<p>Pteris socorrensis, commonly known as the Socorro water fern, is a species of fern native to the island of Socorro in the Revillagigedo archipelago.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water sources such as streams and rocky outcrops. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject in botanical studies.</p>
