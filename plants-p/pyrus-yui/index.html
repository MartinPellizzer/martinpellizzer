                            <h1>Pyrus Yui</h1>
<p>Pyrus yui is a rare and lesser-known species of apple tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its small stature and unique, fragrant fruit. This plant thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts. Its beauty and ecological importance make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
