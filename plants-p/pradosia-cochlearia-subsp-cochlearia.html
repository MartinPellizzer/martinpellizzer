<p>Pradosia cochlearia subsp.</p>
<p>cochlearia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in open woodland or scrub habitats.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pale blue or white. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
