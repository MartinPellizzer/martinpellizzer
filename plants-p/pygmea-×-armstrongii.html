                    <h1>Pygmea × armstrongii</h1>
<p>Pygmea × armstrongii, commonly known as the Armstrong's pygmyweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, succulent leaves that are typically less than an inch in length, adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in the early summer. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Pygmea × armstrongii is well-suited to full sun and requires minimal water once established.</p>
