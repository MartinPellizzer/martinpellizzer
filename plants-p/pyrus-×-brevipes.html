                    <h1>Pyrus × brevipes</h1>

<p>It is a small, compact tree that typically grows to a height of 2–4 meters, making it suitable for small gardens and urban landscapes.

<p>The dwarf pear is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated for its ornamental appeal as well as its fruit.</p>
