                    <h1>Psychopsis papilio var. latourae</h1>
<p>Psychopsis papilio var. latourae, commonly known as the Latour's psychopsis, is a rare and striking bromeliad native to the humid forests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, velvety, waxy leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect and retain moisture. The plant produces showy, orchid-like flowers in shades of pink and purple, which bloom in the early morning. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments.</p>
