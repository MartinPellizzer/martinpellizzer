<p>Platanthera stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lady's-tresses, is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features a slender, unbranched stem with numerous small, white or pale green flowers arranged in a loose, spiral-like inflorescence. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Platanthera stricta is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
