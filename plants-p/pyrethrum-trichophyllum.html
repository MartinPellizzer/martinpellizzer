                    <h1>Pyrethrum trichophyllum</h1>
<p>Pyrethrum trichophyllum, commonly known as the white pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers. The plant produces fine, hairy leaves and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its mild pesticidal properties.</p>
<p>However, it is not as widely used as other pyrethrum species due to its lower potency.</p>
