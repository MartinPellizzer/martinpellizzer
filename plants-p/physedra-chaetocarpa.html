<p>Physedra chaetocarpa, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as marshes and ponds. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may be floating or rooted in the substrate.</p>
<p>Physedra chaetocarpa is known for its ability to photosynthesize during the day and capture prey at night.</p>
