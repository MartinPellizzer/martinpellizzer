                    <h1>Papulipetalum</h1>
<p>Papulipetalum, commonly known as the "papular petal plant," is a rare genus within the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring papillae—small, raised bumps—on the petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are usually small to medium in size, with vibrant colors that attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Papulipetalum is considered a botanically significant but understudied group.</p>
