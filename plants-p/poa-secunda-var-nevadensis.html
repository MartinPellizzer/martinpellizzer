                    <h1>Poa secunda var. nevadensis</h1>
<p>Poa secunda var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which allows it to thrive in high-altitude environments. This variant is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and open slopes at elevations ranging from 6,000 to 12,000 feet. Its compact growth and drought tolerance make it a hardy plant in harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>The species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
