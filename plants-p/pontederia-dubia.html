<p>Pontederia dubia, commonly known as the slender water hyacinth, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features floating leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its striking blue to purple flowers bloom in dense clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Pontederia dubia is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive.</p>
