                    <h1>Pityrogramma microphylla</h1>
<p>Pityrogramma microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaf water fern, is a small, aquatic fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appearance in aquatic gardens.</p>
