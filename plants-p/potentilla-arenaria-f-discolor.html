                    <h1>Potentilla arenaria f. discolor</h1>
<p>Potentilla arenaria f. discolor, commonly known as the silverleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky habitats in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are generally linear to oblanceolate in shape and are arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>This frost-tolerant species is well adapted to poor, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions.</p>
