                    <h1>Paspalum amphicarpum</h1>
<p>Paspalum amphicarpum, commonly known as the watergrass or swamp grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to thrive in saturated soils, making it a common sight in coastal and freshwater wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. One of its notable botanical features is its ability to produce both sexual and asexual reproductive structures, a trait known as amphicarpy.</p>
<p>This adaptability allows it to persist in fluctuating environmental conditions, contributing to its ecological significance in wetland ecosystems.</p>
