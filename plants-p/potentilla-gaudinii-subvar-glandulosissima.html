                    <h1>Potentilla gaudinii subvar. glandulosissima</h1>
<p>Potentilla gaudinii subvar. glandulosissima, commonly known as the glandular potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on long, slender pedicels. Its foliage is often aromatic and may have a slightly woolly texture due to the presence of the glandular trichomes.</p>
<p>This subvariety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
