<p>Psychotria subnubila var. rufovelutina, commonly known as the red-furred psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Andes mountains of South America, particularly in regions of Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a dense, reddish pubescence, giving it its common name. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other Psychotria species, many of which contain psychoactive alkaloids.</p>
