<p>Paepalanthus loxensis, commonly known as the Loxa peacock flower, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble peacock feathers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, moist climate. Its inflorescence consists of small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overshadowed by the showy bracts.</p>
<p>Paepalanthus loxensis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
