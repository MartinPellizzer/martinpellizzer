<p>Pachycentria varingifolia, commonly known as the variable centipede plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the summer months. Its unique appearance and ability to store water make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking visual appeal and low maintenance requirements.</p>
