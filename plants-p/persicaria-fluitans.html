<p>Persicaria fluitans, commonly known as water pepper, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Persicaria fluitans is adapted to thrive in moist soils and can tolerate partial submersion, making it a common species in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
