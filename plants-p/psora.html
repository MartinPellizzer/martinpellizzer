                    <h1>Psora</h1>
<p>Psora, commonly known as the "itch lichen," is a type of parasitic plant that grows on the skin of animals, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Psoraceae and is characterized by its small, crust-like growths that often appear on the body, head, or limbs of its hosts. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead absorbs nutrients directly from the host's skin through its hyphae. Psora thrives in warm, humid environments and is often associated with poor hygiene or weakened immune systems.</p>
<p>Its presence can lead to persistent itching and skin irritation, making it a significant concern in veterinary and human medicine.</p>
