<p>Poa nemoralis var. major, commonly known as the greater wood sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
