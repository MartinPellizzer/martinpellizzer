                    <h1>Petilium eduardii</h1>
<p>Petilium eduardii, commonly known as the velvetleaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and velvety texture, which give it its common name. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. It blooms during the late spring and early summer, producing clusters of fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Petilium eduardii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
