<p>Pseudopyxis quadriflora, commonly known as the four-flowered pseudopyxis, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in a distinctive four-flower arrangement, giving it its scientific name. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is typically found growing in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pseudopyxis quadriflora is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
