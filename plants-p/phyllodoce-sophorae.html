<p>Phyllodoce sophorae, commonly known as the mountain cranberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its often harsh, rocky habitat.</p>
<p>Phyllodoce sophorae is well adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and mountainous regions.</p>
