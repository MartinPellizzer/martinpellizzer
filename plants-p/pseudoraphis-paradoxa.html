<p>Pseudoraphis paradoxa, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a striking desert plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a unique, spine-like structure composed of elongated, segmented stems that give it its dramatic appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically borne at the tips of the stems. Its succulent leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, aiding in water conservation in arid environments.</p>
<p>Pseudoraphis paradoxa is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
