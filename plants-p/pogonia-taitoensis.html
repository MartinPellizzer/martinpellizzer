<p>Pogonia taitoensis, commonly known as the Taito Ghost Orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white flowers with a distinctive purple or pinkish lip, which are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Its delicate, slender leaves are usually clustered at the base, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
