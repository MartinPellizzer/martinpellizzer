                    <h1>Platystele phasmida</h1>
<p>Platystele phasmida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic plant native to the humid forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the early morning. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature and habitat specificity, Platystele phasmida is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
