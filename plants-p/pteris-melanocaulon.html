                    <h1>Pteris melanocaulon</h1>
<p>Pteris melanocaulon, commonly known as the black-stem maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant has a distinctive dark brown, wiry stem that contrasts with its light green, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, but this particular variety does not exhibit that trait.</p>
