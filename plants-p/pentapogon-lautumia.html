                    <h1>Pentapogon lautumia</h1>
<p>Pentapogon lautumia, commonly known as the sea star fern, is a unique plant characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>It is a type of fern that thrives in coastal environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant's fronds are typically pale green and have a waxy coating, which helps protect it from salt spray and strong winds. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle involves both a sporophyte and a gametophyte stage.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species in maritime ecosystems.</p>
