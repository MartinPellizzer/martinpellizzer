                    <h1>Peristylus flagellifer</h1>
<p>Peristylus flagellifer, commonly known as the hairy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in the canopy of rainforests.</p>
<p>Its small, white or pale flowers are followed by fleshy, red berries that serve as a food source for various birds and animals.</p>
