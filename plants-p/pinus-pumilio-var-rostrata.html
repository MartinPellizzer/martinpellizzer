                    <h1>Pinus pumilio var. rostrata</h1>
<p>Pinus pumilio var. rostrata, commonly known as the rostrata mountain pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine native to the high elevations of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated cones and small, needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 centimeters long. The tree grows in harsh, alpine environments, often at elevations above 2,500 meters, where it forms dense, wind-resistant stands. Its cones mature in the second year and release seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in mountain ecosystems.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often found in association with other high-altitude conifers.</p>
