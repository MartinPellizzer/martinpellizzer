                    <h1>Pinus mughus var. lutescens</h1>
<p>Pinus mughus var. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow-barked pine, is a rare variant of the Mughan pine native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow bark, which contrasts with its dark green needles. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it forms dense forests or scattered stands. Its cones are relatively small and mature within one year, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique coloration and ecological adaptations.</p>
