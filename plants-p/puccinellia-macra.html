<p>Puccinellia macra, commonly known as slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal dunes. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, with small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.
