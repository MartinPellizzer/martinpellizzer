                    <h1>Prosthechea crassilabia</h1>
<p>Prosthechea crassilabia, commonly known as the broad-lipped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a short, creeping rhizome with fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a thick layer of white to yellowish hair. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers with a distinctive, broad lip that is characteristic of the genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, particularly bees and wasps, due to their nectar-rich structure.</p>
