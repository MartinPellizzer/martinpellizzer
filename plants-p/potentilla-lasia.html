                    <h1>Potentilla lasia</h1>
<p>Potentilla lasia, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate touch to its rugged environment. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Potentilla lasia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
