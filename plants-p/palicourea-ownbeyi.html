<p>It is a shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mesic to wet forest habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in Hawaii.</p>
