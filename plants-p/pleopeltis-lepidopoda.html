                    <h1>Pleopeltis lepidopoda</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis lepidopoda, commonly known as the veined rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, wiry fronds that are often covered with fine, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense clusters, anchoring it to its substrate.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat.</p>
