                    <h1>Paepalanthus jenmanii</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's puya, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andean highlands of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
