                    <h1>Poa protuberata</h1>
<p>Poa protuberata, commonly known as the cushion grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like clumps with short, stiff stems and small, tufted leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit, it is well adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
