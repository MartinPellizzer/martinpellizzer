                    <h1>Polystichum multifidum var. dusenii</h1>
<p>Polystichum multifidum var. dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf wood fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, intricately divided fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
