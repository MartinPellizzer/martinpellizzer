<p>Pandanus navicularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Pandanaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Pacific Islands, including parts of Polynesia and Micronesia. The plant is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and for thatching. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with fragrant flowers, which are pollinated by insects and birds.</p>
<p>The fruit, a fibrous structure containing seeds, is dispersed by water and wind, contributing to its spread across coastal areas.</p>
