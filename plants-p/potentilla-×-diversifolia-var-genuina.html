                    <h1>Potentilla × diversifolia var. genuina</h1>
<p>Potentilla × diversifolia var. genuina, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, upright stems covered in silvery-white, woolly hairs that help it retain heat in cold climates. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and they remain green throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
