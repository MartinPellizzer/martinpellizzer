<p>Polystichum erosum, commonly known as the erose wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive erose (notched) margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which develop in late summer.</p>
<p>Polystichum erosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
