<p>Poa badensis var. xerophila, commonly known as the desert bluegrass, is a variant of the bluegrass genus native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, dense growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny blue to purple flowers. It has adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and can withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats.</p>
