                    <h1>Phoradendron pifoense</h1>
<p>Phoradendron pifoense, commonly known as the Pifoense mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its leafless stems that attach to the branches of host trees. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its hemiparasitic relationship with its host. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth habit and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat.</p>
