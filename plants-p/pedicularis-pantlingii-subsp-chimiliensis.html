<p>Pedicularis pantlingii subsp.</p>
<p>chimiliensis, commonly known as the Chimil Valley Lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
