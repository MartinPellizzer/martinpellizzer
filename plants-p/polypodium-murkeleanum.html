<p>Polypodium murkeleanum, commonly known as the Indian cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its rhizome is thick and wiry, anchoring it to substrates while absorbing moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
