<p>Phyteuma delphinense f. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine phyteuma, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of blue to violet bell-shaped flowers. The foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is typically found in alpine meadows at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
