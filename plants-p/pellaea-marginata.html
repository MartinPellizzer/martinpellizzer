<p>Pellaea marginata, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The silver fern is not only ornamental but also holds cultural significance in MƒÅori traditions.</p>
