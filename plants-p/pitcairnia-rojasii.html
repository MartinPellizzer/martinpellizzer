                    <h1>Pitcairnia rojasii</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia rojasii, commonly known as the rojasii air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, woolly coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that can reach several feet in height, often with vibrant red or orange flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
