                    <h1>Pyramidoptera cabulica</h1>
<p>Pyramidoptera cabulica, commonly known as the Kabul pygmy grasshopper, is a small insect belonging to the family Pyrgoceratidae.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plant is not a true plant but a type of grasshopper, so it does not have botanical features like leaves, roots, or flowers. Instead, it plays a role in the ecosystem as a herbivorous insect that feeds on grasses and shrubs.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of the health and biodiversity of its alpine habitat.</p>
