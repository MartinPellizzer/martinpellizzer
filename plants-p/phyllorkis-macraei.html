                    <h1>Phyllorkis macraei</h1>
<p>Phyllorkis macraei, commonly known as the Macrae's lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found primarily in the temperate rainforests of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its crustose growth form, which adheres tightly to rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a finely granular texture. It plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
