                    <h1>Panicum zizanioides var. microphyllum</h1>
<p>Panicum zizanioides var. microphyllum, commonly known as little barleygrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a valuable forage crop and a potential weed.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its adaptability to a wide range of soil types and its ability to thrive in disturbed environments.</p>
