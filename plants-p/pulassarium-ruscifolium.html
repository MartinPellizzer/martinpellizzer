                    <h1>Pulassarium ruscifolium</h1>
<p>Pulassarium ruscifolium, commonly known as the swamp bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, where it relies on capturing insects to supplement its nutrient intake. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise above the water surface.</p>
<p>Pulassarium ruscifolium plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
