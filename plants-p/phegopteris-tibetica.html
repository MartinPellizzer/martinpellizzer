                    <h1>Phegopteris tibetica</h1>
<p>Phegopteris tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in mountain lakes and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>Phegopteris tibetica plays a significant ecological role in its habitat by contributing to water oxygenation and providing shelter for small aquatic organisms.</p>
