                    <h1>Pneumatopteris kerintjiensis</h1>
<p>Pneumatopteris kerintjiensis, commonly known as the Kerintji fern, is a rare and ancient species of fern native to the mountainous regions of the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of more primitive ferns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
