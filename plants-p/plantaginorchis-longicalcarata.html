                    <h1>Plantaginorchis longicalcarata</h1>
<p>Plantaginorchis longicalcarata, commonly known as the long-beaked plantain orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring showy, lip-like petals and a distinctive, elongated spur that houses nectar. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in rocky or humus-rich soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and wasps.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
