<p>Polystachya albescens subsp.</p>
<p>imbricata, commonly known as the white-veined orchid, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale green flowers.</p>
<p>The leaves are linear and often covered with a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its habitat.</p>
