                    <h1>Phlebophyllum apricum</h1>
<p>Phlebophyllum apricum, commonly known as the spring fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that unfurl in early spring, giving it a fresh, verdant appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread gradually across the forest floor.</p>
<p>Phlebophyllum apricum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to add texture to woodland gardens.</p>
