                    <h1>Pisonia acuminata</h1>
<p>Pisonia acuminata, commonly known as the coral tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red or orange bract clusters that resemble coral, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Pisonia acuminata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant display.</p>
