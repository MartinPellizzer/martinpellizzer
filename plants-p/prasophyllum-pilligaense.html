<p>Prasophyllum pilligaense, commonly known as the Pilliga orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Pilliga Forest in New South Wales, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant with a single stem that produces a single flower, typically in shades of white or pale pink. The plant has a dense, fibrous root system adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. It blooms during the spring and early summer, relying on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native region.</p>
