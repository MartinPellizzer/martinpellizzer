<p>Pyrus velebitica, commonly known as the Velebit pear, is a rare species native to the Dinaric Alps, specifically found in Croatia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in mountainous regions with a preference for well-drained, calcareous soils. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. Its small, white flowers appear in early spring, followed by edible pears that are small and yellowish in color.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus velebitica is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
