                    <h1>Parajubaea torallyi var. torallyi</h1>
<p>Parajubaea torallyi var. torallyi, commonly known as the Toralii Jubaea, is a rare and endangered cycad native to the Andes Mountains of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and is protected in conservation programs.</p>
