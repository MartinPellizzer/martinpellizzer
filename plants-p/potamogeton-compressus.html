                    <h1>Potamogeton compressus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton compressus, commonly known as narrowleaf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments across North America.</p>
<p>It has long, slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter wide, arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spike-like structures, often emerging from the water surface. Its rhizomes form dense underwater mats, contributing to habitat structure for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Potamogeton compressus plays a vital role in water filtration and provides shelter for fish and invertebrates.</p>
