                    <h1>Paphinia tigrina</h1>
<p>Paphinia tigrina, commonly known as the tiger orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, tiger-like striping on its leaves and its elegant, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and among orchid enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from deforestation, Paphinia tigrina is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
