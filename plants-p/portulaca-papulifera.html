                    <h1>Portulaca papulifera</h1>
<p>Portulaca papulifera, commonly known as the cushion portulaca, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, succulent perennial that forms dense, mat-like clusters of fleshy, spiny leaves. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in fine,绒毛-like hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Portulaca papulifera is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh climates.</p>
