                <h1>Polystichum uliginosum</h1>
<p>Polystichum uliginosum, commonly known as the bog fern, is a species of fern native to wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands.</p>
<p>It has dark green, leathery fronds that are often densely packed, forming a dense mat on the forest floor. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is typically found in temperate regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the wet substrate, while its spores are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The bog fern plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
