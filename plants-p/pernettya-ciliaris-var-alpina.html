<p>Pernettya ciliaris var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of red or orange berries. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in alpine tundra and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant.</p>
