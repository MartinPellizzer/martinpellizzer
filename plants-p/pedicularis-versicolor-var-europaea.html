                    <h1>Pedicularis versicolor var. europaea</h1>
<p>Pedicularis versicolor var. europaea, commonly known as the European spotted winter orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. Its flowers are usually pink or purple with yellow markings, and it blooms from late winter to early spring.</p>
<p>This rare species is found in parts of Europe and is often associated with specific host plants like Betula and Pinus.</p>
