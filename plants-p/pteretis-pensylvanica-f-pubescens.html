                    <h1>Pteretis pensylvanica f. pubescens</h1>
<p>Pteretis pensylvanica f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent Pennsylvania willow, is a variant of the Pennsylvania willow characterized by its hairy or pubescent foliage.</p>
<p>This plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a soft, fuzzy texture due to the presence of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for wind pollination.</p>
<p>It is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
