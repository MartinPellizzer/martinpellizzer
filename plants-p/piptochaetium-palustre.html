<p>Piptochaetium palustre, commonly known as marsh needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, moist soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland environments.</p>
