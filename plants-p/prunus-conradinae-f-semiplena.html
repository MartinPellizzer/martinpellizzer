<p>Prunus conradinae f. semiplena, commonly known as the Conrad's cherry or the Florida cherry, is a unique horticultural form of the Prunus conradinae species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, double-flowered appearance, which results from the presence of numerous stamens that resemble petals. This form is typically cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly during the spring when it produces clusters of white or pink blossoms. The plant is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a desirable specimen for gardens and botanical collections.</p>
