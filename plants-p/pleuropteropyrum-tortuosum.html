                    <h1>Pleuropteropyrum tortuosum</h1>
<p>Pleuropteropyrum tortuosum, commonly known as the twisted fern, is a rare and delicate fern species belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that exhibit a distinctive spiral arrangement, giving it a unique visual appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in low light conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
