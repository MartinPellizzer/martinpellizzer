<p>Phaius augustinianus, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in the soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The leaves are long and strap-like, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
