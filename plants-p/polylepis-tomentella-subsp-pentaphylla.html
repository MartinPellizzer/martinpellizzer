<p>Polylepis tomentella subsp.</p>
<p>pentaphylla, commonly known as the Andean velvet tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and bark, which provide insulation against the cold climate.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in cloud forests and p√°ramo ecosystems, where it plays a crucial role in soil stabilization and habitat provision. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody, elongated fruits.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, this species is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
