                    <h1>Panicum canescens</h1>
<p>Panicum canescens, commonly known as gray bluestem, is a tall, warm-season grass native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and upright growth habit, often reaching heights of 3 to 6 feet. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open fields and prairies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common component of native grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ecological benefits, it is often used in restoration projects and as a forage crop.</p>
