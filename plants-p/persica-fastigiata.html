                    <h1>Persica fastigiata</h1>
<p>Persica fastigiata, commonly known as the upright peach tree, is a species of peach native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, columnar growth habit, which makes it ideal for small spaces and urban gardening. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by sweet, yellow or orange fruits in late summer. Its leaves are broad and dark green, providing a striking visual contrast to the fruit.</p>
<p>Persica fastigiata is relatively drought-tolerant and requires well-drained soil to thrive.</p>
