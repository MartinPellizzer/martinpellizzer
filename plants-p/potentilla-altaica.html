                    <h1>Potentilla altaica</h1>
<p>Potentilla altaica, commonly known as the Siberian cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the cold climates of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with woody stems and small, serrated leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
