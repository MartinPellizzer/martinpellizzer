<p>Polemonium reptans f. macrophyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaf twinflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polemoniaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical Polemonium reptans, giving it its "macrophyllum" designation, which means "large leaf.". Its flowers are clustered in pairs, a feature that contributes to its common name "twinflower.".</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
