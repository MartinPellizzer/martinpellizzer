<p>Pseudocodon rosulatus, commonly known as the Rosulate Pseudocodon, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, also known as the ice plant family, which is known for its succulent species.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
