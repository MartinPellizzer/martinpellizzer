<p>Puccinellia distans subsp.</p>
<p>glauca, commonly known as bluegrass puccinellia, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as sand dunes, roadsides, and gravelly soils.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, blue-gray leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions due to its deep root system and reduced leaf surface area.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in association with other xerophytic plants in its native environment.</p>
