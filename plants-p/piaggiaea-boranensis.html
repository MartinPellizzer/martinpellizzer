<p>Piaggiaea boranensis, commonly known as the Boran's ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the arid regions of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, ephemeral blooms that appear only under specific environmental conditions. The plant has a low-growing, succulent structure adapted to conserve water in its harsh habitat. Its flowers are typically pale blue or white, with a unique, almost translucent appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its extreme rarity and habitat specificity, Piaggiaea boranensis is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
