<p>Polypodium tenerrimum, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and attaches itself to trees or rocks without parasitizing them. Its rhizomes form a dense, velvety covering that helps anchor it to its substrate.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically evergreen, with a leathery texture and a deep green color.</p>
