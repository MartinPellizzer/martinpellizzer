                    <h1>Paepalanthus speciosus var. glaber</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus speciosus var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth paepalanthus, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial bromeliad characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically smooth and waxy, which helps in reducing water loss in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
