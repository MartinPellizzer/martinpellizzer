                    <h1>Parkinsonia africana</h1>
<p>Parkinsonia africana, commonly known as the umbrella thorn tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, umbrella-like crown of feathery leaves and long, pendulous yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the tree provides habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>The wood is lightweight and used for construction and fuel, though it is not particularly strong.</p>
