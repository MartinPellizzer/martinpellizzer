                    <h1>Platostoma tectum</h1>
<p>Platostoma tectum, commonly known as the common marsh clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Micropteris.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and dark green, scale-like leaves that form dense mats. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in small, club-shaped clusters on the leaf surfaces. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Platostoma tectum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native habitats.</p>
