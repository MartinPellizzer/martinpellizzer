                    <h1>Pilostyles globosa</h1>
<p>Pilostyles globosa, commonly known as the globular broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, yellowish-white inflorescence composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. The plant is native to parts of Africa and is often found growing on the roots of various grasses and shrubs. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain minute seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and unique appearance, it is considered an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
