                    <h1>Parathesis rosea</h1>
<p>Parathesis rosea, commonly known as the rose-like parasol mushroom, is a species of fungus rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tricholomataceae and is characterized by its distinctive, pinkish or reddish cap with a fibrous texture. The gills are typically pale yellow and the stem is slender with a bulbous base. It is often found in woodlands, growing on decaying wood, particularly in association with coniferous trees.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance, it is sometimes mistaken for a flower or a decorative object in its natural habitat.</p>
