<p>Picea abies var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf Norway spruce, is a compact, low-growing variant of the Norway spruce.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage that is typically shorter and more rounded than that of the standard species. This variety is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in rocky or poor soils. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative plant in alpine settings.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, cone-like fruits that contain winged seeds, typical of the coniferous family.</p>
