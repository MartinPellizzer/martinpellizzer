                    <h1>Pteris phanerophlebia</h1>
<p>Pteris phanerophlebia, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically divided into multiple pairs of pinnae, which are broad and often have a wavy margin. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest understories.</p>
<p>Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates.</p>
