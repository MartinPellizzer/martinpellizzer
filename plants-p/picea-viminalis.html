<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its wood is strong and durable, making it valuable for construction and furniture.</p>
<p>The Siberian pine is also notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, snowy environments.</p>
