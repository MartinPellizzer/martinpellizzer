                    <h1>Pattara welwitschii</h1>
<p>Pattara welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia mirabilis, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its two long, strap-like leaves that can grow up to 4 meters in length and persist for decades. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in arid conditions by accessing underground water sources. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects and birds.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and rarity, it is considered a living fossil and a symbol of the Namib Desert's ecological resilience.</p>
