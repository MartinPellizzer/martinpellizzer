<p>Polystichum fuscum, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Polystichum fuscum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions.</p>
