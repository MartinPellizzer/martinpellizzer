<p>Phleum hubbardii, commonly known as Hubbard's fescue, is a perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ecological value, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a ornamental plant.</p>
