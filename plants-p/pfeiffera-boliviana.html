                    <h1>Pfeiffera boliviana</h1>
<p>Pfeiffera boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian pfeiffera, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean regions of Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and woody stems. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowering period typically occurs during the cooler months, producing clusters of small, pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pfeiffera boliviana is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat degradation.</p>
