<p>Pedicularis platychila, commonly known as the broad-leaved lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are broad and often arranged in a rosette, and it thrives in moist, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pedicularis platychila is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
