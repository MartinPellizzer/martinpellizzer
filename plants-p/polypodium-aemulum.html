<p>Polypodium aemulum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a terrestrial fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates or in forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium aemulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature.</p>
