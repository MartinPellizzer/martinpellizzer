                <h1>Panicum acuminatum</h1>
<p>Panicum acuminatum, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to various parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is valued for its ecological role in wetland habitats and its use in ornamental landscaping.</p>
