                    <h1>Picea morinda</h1>
<p>Picea morinda, commonly known as the Morinda fir, is a rare and little-known conifer native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The cones of Picea morinda are typically small and cone-shaped, containing edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
