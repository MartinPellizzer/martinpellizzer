<p>Parodia ottonis subsp.</p>
<p>horstii, commonly known as the Horstii Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to southern Mexico. It features a dense covering of white to pale blue spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its blue-green stems. It is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its slow growth and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts.</p>
