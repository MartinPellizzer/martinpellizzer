                    <h1>Phegopteris aurita</h1>
<p>Phegopteris aurita, commonly known as the interrupted fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into segments with a unique, interrupted pattern.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered with a dense, woolly layer of brownish hairs.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, which helps in attracting pollinators and dispersing spores.</p>
