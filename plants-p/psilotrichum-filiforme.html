                    <h1>Psilotrichum filiforme</h1>
<p>Psilotrichum filiforme, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, low-growing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, thread-like leaves and small, spore-bearing structures called strobila. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a primitive structure, resembling ancient vascular plants, and lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the conventional sense.</p>
<p>Its reproductive cycle relies on spores, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
