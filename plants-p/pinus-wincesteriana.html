The tree has slender, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and its needles are long and slender, often retaining their color through winter. It is characterized by its slow growth rate and unique ecological niche, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically endangered and requires specialized conservation efforts.</p>
