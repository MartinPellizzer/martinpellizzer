<p>Polycarpon caespitosum, commonly known as prickly sowthistle, is a low-growing annual plant characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit.</p>
<p>It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the early summer, followed by small, round seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings.</p>
