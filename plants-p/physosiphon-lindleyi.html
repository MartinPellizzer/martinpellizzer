<p>Physosiphon lindleyi, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate, white, spider-like flowers. The plant relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, bark, and surrounding environment. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on trees in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
