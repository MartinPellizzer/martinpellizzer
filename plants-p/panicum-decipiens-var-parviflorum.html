The plant produces small, pale green or reddish spikelets that are clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
