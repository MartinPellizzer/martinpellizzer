<p>Pyrus communis var. longicaudis, commonly known as the long-tailed pear, is a lesser-known variant of the common pear.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, tapering fruit shape, which distinguishes it from the more typical round or oval pears. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, with deciduous leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its flowers are clustered and have a sweet fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated, it is appreciated for its unique appearance and potential use in ornamental gardening.</p>
