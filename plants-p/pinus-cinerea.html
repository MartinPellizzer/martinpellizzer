<p>Pinus cinerea, commonly known as the gray pine, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and its ability to thrive in dry, rocky environments. The tree produces cones that contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife species. Its needle-like leaves are typically arranged in bundles of five, and they remain on the tree for several years.</p>
<p>Pinus cinerea is also notable for its role in stabilizing soil in arid regions.</p>
