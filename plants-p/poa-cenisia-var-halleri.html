                    <h1>Poa cenisia var. halleri</h1>
<p>Poa cenisia var. halleri, commonly known as Haller's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, soft leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it thrive in rocky and nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in mountainous areas where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>
