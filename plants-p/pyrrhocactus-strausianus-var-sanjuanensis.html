                    <h1>Pyrrhocactus strausianus var. sanjuanensis</h1>
<p>Pyrrhocactus strausianus var. sanjuanensis, commonly known as the San Juan pyrrhocactus, is a rare cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globose shape and ribbed structure, which helps it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise desolate appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, making it a resilient plant in harsh desert conditions.</p>
