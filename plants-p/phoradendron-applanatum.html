                    <h1>Phoradendron applanatum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron applanatum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds. Its parasitic nature allows it to thrive in various forest ecosystems, though it can weaken its host over time.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic habits, Phoradendron applanatum plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for wildlife.</p>
