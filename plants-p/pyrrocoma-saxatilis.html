<p>Pyrrocoma saxatilis, commonly known as the rock pygmyweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, succulent-like foliage and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Pyrrocoma saxatilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment.</p>
