                    <h1>Palisota plagiocarpa</h1>
<p>Palisota plagiocarpa, commonly known as the broad-leaved sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves arranged in a dense rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Palisota plagiocarpa thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat.</p>
