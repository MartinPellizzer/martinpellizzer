<p>Peixotoa leptoclada, commonly known as the Brazilian fern, is a species of fern native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
