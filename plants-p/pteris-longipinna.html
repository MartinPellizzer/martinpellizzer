<p>Pteris longipinna, commonly known as the long-pinnate water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often found near water sources such as streams or ponds. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Pteris longipinna is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation.</p>
