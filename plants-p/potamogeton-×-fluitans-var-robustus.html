                    <h1>Potamogeton × fluitans var. robustus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × fluitans var. robustus, commonly known as the robust water milfoil, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, floating or submerged growth habit and its distinctive, finely divided leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which emerge from the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, and is often found in shallow, nutrient-rich waters.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it can play a significant role in aquatic ecosystems, both as a habitat provider and a potential weed.</p>
