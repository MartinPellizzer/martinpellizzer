<p>Paleolaria fastigiata, commonly known as the tall spike moss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, spire-like growth habit, with dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves along its stem. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its structure resembles that of a moss but is more complex, featuring true roots, stems, and leaves.</p>
<p>Paleolaria fastigiata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
