<p>Pellaea cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It features dark green, leathery, heart-shaped fronds that are densely packed and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a characteristic feature of ferns. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Pellaea cordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
