                    <h1>Papaver dubium var. maroccanum</h1>
<p>Papaver dubium var. maroccanum, commonly known as the Moroccan poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright red petals that resemble those of the common poppy, though it is smaller in size. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often growing in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
