                    <h1>Pleurogramme furcata</h1>
<p>Pleurogramme furcata, commonly known as the forked water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches, where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, enabling it to propagate through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is often found in wetland habitats across temperate regions.</p>
