<p>Pinguicula sodalium, commonly known as the common butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and wet meadows. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, with four petals that are arranged symmetrically.</p>
<p>Pinguicula sodalium is a perennial species that relies on photosynthesis for energy but supplements its nutrient intake by digesting captured prey.</p>
