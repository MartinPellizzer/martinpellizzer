<p>Potamogeton obtusifolius f. latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved pondweed, is a variant of the pondweed species native to freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5–15 cm in length. The plant is submerged, with long, flexible stems that help it float or remain suspended in water. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in spike-like clusters, and it produces both male and female flowers on the same plant.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in slow-moving or still waters, contributing to aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen.</p>
