<p>Phlegmariurus melanesicus, commonly known as the Melanesian haircap moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its wiry, leafy stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a thick layer of hyaline cells. This moss typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, across parts of Melanesia. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on long, slender stalks and release spores when mature.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and growth habits reflect its adaptation to humid, temperate climates.</p>
