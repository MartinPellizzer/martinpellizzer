<p>Podostemum uruguayense, commonly known as the Uruguay water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are often clustered at the water's surface. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are typically short-lived and pollinated by insects. Its roots are adapted for anchoring in submerged substrates, and it thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
