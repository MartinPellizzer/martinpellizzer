                    <h1>Papaver somniferum convar. indicum</h1>
<p>Papaver somniferum convar. indicum, commonly known as the Indian poppy, is a variant of the opium poppy characterized by its distinctive orange or red flowers.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of Asia, particularly India, and is known for its striking, showy blooms that appear in late summer. The plant has a taproot system and typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are alternate along the stem. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a source of alkaloids, including morphine and codeine, which are derived from its latex.</p>
<p>However, due to its association with illicit drug production, it is subject to strict regulation in many countries.</p>
