<p>Pilosella sphaerocephala subsp.</p>
<p>brevifurca, commonly known as the dwarf globeflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a compact rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, showy white or yellowish flowers arranged in a spherical shape, which gives it its common name. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountain meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
