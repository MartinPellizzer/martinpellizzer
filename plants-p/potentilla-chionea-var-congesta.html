<p>Potentilla chionea var. congesta, commonly known as the snowbush, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silver-gray foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
