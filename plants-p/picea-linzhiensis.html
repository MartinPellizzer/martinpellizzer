<p>Picea linzhiensis, commonly known as the Linzhi fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are densely packed. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
