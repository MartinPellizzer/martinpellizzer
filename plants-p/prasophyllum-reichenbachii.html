<p>Prasophyllum reichenbachii, commonly known as the common leek orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the trunks of eucalyptus trees and has a tall, erect stem with a single spike of white to pale green flowers. The plant produces small, leek-like leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stem. It blooms between September and November, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>This orchid is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
