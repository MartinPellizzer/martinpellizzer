<p>Phyllanthus heterophyllus, commonly known as the variable leaf phyllanthus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Phyllanthaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its diverse leaf shapes, which vary significantly across different populations. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>This adaptability in morphology makes it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
