                    <h1>Polypodium lugubre</h1>
<p>Polypodium lugubre, commonly known as the black hound's-tongue, is a fern native to the temperate regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that give it a striking, almost prehistoric appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium lugubre is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shaded garden settings.</p>
