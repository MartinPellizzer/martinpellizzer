<p>Potentilla hooglandii var. rufa, commonly known as the red-stemmed cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, reddish stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, pinnately compound leaves with five leaflets, which are typically hairy and grayish-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant fall color and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
