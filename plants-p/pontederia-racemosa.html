                    <h1>Pontederia racemosa</h1>
<p>Pontederia racemosa, commonly known as pickerelweed, is a semi-aquatic plant native to the United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in tall, spike-like clusters above broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes, often forming dense stands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a common weed and an important habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically floating or semi-submerged, with the lower leaves often submerged in water.</p>
