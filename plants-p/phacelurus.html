                    <h1>Phacelurus</h1>
<p>Phacelurus, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or herbs native to the Americas. The plants typically have alternate, simple leaves that are often leathery and dark green. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, followed by berries that are toxic to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Due to their toxicity, Phacelurus species are often avoided in horticulture and are considered more of a wild plant than a cultivated one.</p>
