                    <h1>Phlox scleranthifolia</h1>
<p>Phlox scleranthifolia, commonly known as the rock phlox, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Phlox scleranthifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
