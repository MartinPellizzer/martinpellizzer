<p>Pilosocereus zappiae, commonly known as the Zappia cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spineless cactus that typically forms dense clumps, with pale green to bluish-gray stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often nocturnal in bloom. It has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from brief rainfall events.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
