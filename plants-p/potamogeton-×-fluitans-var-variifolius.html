                    <h1>Potamogeton × fluitans var. variifolius</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × fluitans var. variifolius, commonly known as the variable water milfoil, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves, which are typically narrow and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often emerging from the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds.</p>
<p>Its morphology and hybrid origin make it an interesting subject for botanical study and ecological research.</p>
