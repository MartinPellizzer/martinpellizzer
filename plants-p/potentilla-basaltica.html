                    <h1>Potentilla basaltica</h1>
<p>Potentilla basaltica, commonly known as the basalt cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with woody stems and small, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
