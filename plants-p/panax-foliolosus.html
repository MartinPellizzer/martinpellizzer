                    <h1>Panax foliolosus</h1>
<p>Panax foliolosus, commonly known as the leafy ginseng, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Araliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring compound leaves with serrated edges and a deep green coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in the understory of temperate forests. Its roots, though not as commercially valuable as those of Panax ginseng, are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Panax foliolosus is considered an endangered species in its native range.</p>
