<p>Pterostylis ophioglossa subsp.</p>
<p>fusca, commonly known as the black-veined greenhood, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and a single, hooded flower that is typically green with purple veins.</p>
<p>The plant grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly thrips, which are attracted to the nectar-rich labellum.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its darker pigmentation and narrower leaf structure compared to other members of the species.</p>
