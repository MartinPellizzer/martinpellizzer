<p>Pinalia szetschuanica, commonly known as the Sichuan pinyon, is a rare gymnosperm native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Pinaceae family, which includes pines, spruces, and firs, and is characterized by its coniferous structure. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and cone-bearing structures, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high elevations, often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
