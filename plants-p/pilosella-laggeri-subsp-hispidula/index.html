                            <h1>Pilosella Laggeri Subsp. Hispidula</h1>
<p>Hispid fleabane, scientifically known as Pilosella laggeri subsp. hispidula, is a small, flowering plant native to the high mountain regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. This species thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and dry slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable plant. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
