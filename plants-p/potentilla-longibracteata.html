                    <h1>Potentilla longibracteata</h1>
<p>Potentilla longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces elongated bracts beneath its flowers, giving it its scientific name, and is often found in rocky soils at high elevations.</p>
<p>Potentilla longibracteata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine by some indigenous communities.</p>
