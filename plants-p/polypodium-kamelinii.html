<p>Polypodium kamelinii, commonly known as the Kamelin's shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical forests. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
