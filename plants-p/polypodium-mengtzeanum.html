<p>Polypodium mengtzeanum, commonly known as Mengtze's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant is native to Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which aid in water retention.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
