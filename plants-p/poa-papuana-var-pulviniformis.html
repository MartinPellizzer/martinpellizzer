                    <h1>Poa papuana var. pulviniformis</h1>
<p>Poa papuana var. pulviniformis, commonly known as the Papuan cushion grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like cushions that are well adapted to harsh alpine and subalpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its ecological importance in stabilizing mountainous terrain.</p>
