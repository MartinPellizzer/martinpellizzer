                    <h1>Phalaris trigyna</h1>
<p>Phalaris trigyna, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained to wet soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, and its narrow, grass-like leaves are often blue-green in color. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
