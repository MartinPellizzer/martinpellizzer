                    <h1>Pachypodium tomentosum</h1>
<p>Pachypodium tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly pachypodium, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features a thick, stem-like trunk covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, reducing water evaporation and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Pachypodium tomentosum is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established.</p>
