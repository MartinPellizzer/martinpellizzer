<p>Poa depauperata, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
