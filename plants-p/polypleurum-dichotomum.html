<p>Polypleurum dichotomum, commonly known as the forked fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that divide into two equal parts, giving it a distinctive forked appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
