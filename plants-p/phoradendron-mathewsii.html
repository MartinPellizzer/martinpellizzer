                    <h1>Phoradendron mathewsii</h1>
<p>Phoradendron mathewsii, commonly known as the Mathews' mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat through seed dispersal and nutrient cycling.</p>
