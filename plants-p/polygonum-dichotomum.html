                    <h1>Polygonum dichotomum</h1>
<p>Polygonum dichotomum, commonly known as the forked knotweed, is a perennial herb native to Asia and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly, making it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Polygonum dichotomum is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in wet meadows.</p>
