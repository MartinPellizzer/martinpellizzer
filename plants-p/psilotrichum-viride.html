                    <h1>Psilotrichum viride</h1>
<p>Psilotrichum viride, commonly known as the green psilotrichum, is a rare and primitive fern-like plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, branching structure and lack of true leaves, instead having small, scale-like structures called protostome. The plant produces sporangia that are clustered in groups called synangia, which are typically found on the upper surface of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its ancient lineage and unique morphology, it is of great interest to botanists studying early plant evolution.</p>
