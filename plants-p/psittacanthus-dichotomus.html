                    <h1>Psittacanthus dichotomus</h1>
<p>Psittacanthus dichotomus, commonly known as the split-leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, dichotomous branching pattern, where each stem splits into two equal branches at regular intervals. The plant produces large, pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture. Its cones, which are either male or female, are essential for its reproductive process.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
