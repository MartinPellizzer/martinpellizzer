<p>Plumatichilos littoralis, commonly known as the coastal feathergrass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, feathery inflorescences that produce small, pale blue to purple flowers. This species thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its growth habit is low and spreading, forming dense mats that help stabilize dune systems.</p>
<p>Plumatichilos littoralis plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
