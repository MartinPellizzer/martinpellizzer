<p>Prunus domestica var. insititia, commonly known as the common blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and small, black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by the berries. It is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, thriving in poor soils.</p>
<p>The berries are used in culinary and medicinal applications, though they are generally quite tart and require processing.</p>
