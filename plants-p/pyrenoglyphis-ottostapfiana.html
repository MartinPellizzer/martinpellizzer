<p>Pyrenoglyphis ottostapfiana, commonly known as the St. Helena sandwort, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, succulent habit with fleshy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and endangered species.</p>
