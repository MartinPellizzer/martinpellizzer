                    <h1>Phyllodes baraquinii</h1>
<p>Phyllodes baraquinii, commonly known as the silky wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow, hairless phyllodes that resemble leaves, though they are actually modified stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The silky wattle is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping.</p>
