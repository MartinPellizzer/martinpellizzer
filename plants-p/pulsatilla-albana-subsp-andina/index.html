<p>Andean pasqueflower, scientifically known as Pulsatilla albana subsp. andina, is a rare and delicate alpine plant native to the highlands of South America. It thrives in cold, rocky environments where few other species can survive, showcasing its resilience and adaptability. With its striking white petals and yellow center, it is a symbol of the fragile beauty found in extreme ecosystems. This plant is often overlooked despite its ecological importance and unique characteristics. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this species from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
