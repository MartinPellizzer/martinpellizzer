                    <h1>Pleopeltis werneri</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis werneri, commonly known as the Werneri's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The fronds are typically leathery and have a dense, overlapping arrangement, which helps the plant retain moisture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
