                    <h1>Polypodium fragile</h1>
<p>Polypodium fragile, commonly known as the brittle shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is wiry and often forms dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns.</p>
