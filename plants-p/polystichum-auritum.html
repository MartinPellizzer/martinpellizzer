<p>Polystichum auritum, commonly known as the auriculate fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. The fronds often have auriculate (ear-shaped) lobes at the base, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
