                    <h1>Pisonia gigantocarpa</h1>
<p>Pisonia gigantocarpa, commonly known as the giant crabapple, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant produces large, inedible, red berries that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy texture, adapted to the humid, tropical environments it inhabits.</p>
<p>Pisonia gigantocarpa is also notable for its ability to grow in coastal areas, where it tolerates salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
