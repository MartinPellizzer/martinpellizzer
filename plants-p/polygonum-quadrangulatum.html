<p>Polygonum quadrangulatum, commonly known as the four-angle knotweed, is a perennial herb native to Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its square, angular stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species.</p>
