                    <h1>Pistolochia solida</h1>
<p>Pistolochia solida, commonly known as the hardy dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is native to parts of Africa and Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique, thread-like appearance due to its reduced leaves. It is often found growing on the stems of other plants, such as grasses and shrubs.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant growth and diversity.</p>
