<p>Pinalia ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's pincushion, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiky inflorescence that resembles a pincushion. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the spring and are pollinated primarily by bees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pinalia ledermannii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
