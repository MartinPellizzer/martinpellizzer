                    <h1>Phegopteris manipurensis</h1>
<p>Phegopteris manipurensis, commonly known as the Manipur fern, is a rare species native to the northeastern regions of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive, light green color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
