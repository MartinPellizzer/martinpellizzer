<p>Phyllobolus digitatus subsp.</p>
<p>littlewoodii, commonly known as the Littlewood's leaf beetle, is a species of leaf beetle native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its elongated, metallic green body and distinctive leaf-like appearance, which helps it blend into its environment.</p>
<p>The subspecies is typically found on specific host plants, such as certain species of Euphorbia. Its larvae feed on the leaves of these plants, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
<p>This beetle plays a role in both plant herbivory and as a food source for other organisms in the ecosystem.</p>
