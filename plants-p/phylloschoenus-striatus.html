<p>Phylloschoenus striatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its roots anchor it to the bottom of still or slow-moving water bodies.</p>
<p>Phylloschoenus striatus plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
