<p>Packera multilobata, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy, often glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring moist, well-drained soils in rocky or open habitats. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a distinctive silvery or grayish underside due to dense pubescence.</p>
<p>The showy yellow flowers appear in late summer, contributing to its ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators.</p>
