                    <h1>Potamogeton × zizii var. methyensis</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × zizii var. methyensis, commonly known as the methane grass or swamp milfoil, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like structures, typically emerging from the water surface. It thrives in nutrient-rich, stagnant or slow-moving waters, often forming dense vegetation that can alter local water chemistry.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, impacting native plant communities and water quality.</p>
