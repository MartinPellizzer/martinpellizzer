<p>Pelta palustris, commonly known as the marsh shield-fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and marshes, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pelta palustris is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
