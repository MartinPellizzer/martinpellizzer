<p>Panicum divaricatissimum var. macractinium, commonly known as the giant panicgrass, is a tall grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender blades and distinctive, drooping inflorescences that can reach several meters in height. The plant thrives in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and marshes, where it forms dense stands. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with fine hairs, while the flowering structures consist of spikelets arranged in a panicle.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive.</p>
