                    <h1>Peucedanum giraldii</h1>
<p>Peucedanum giraldii, commonly known as the Corsican angelica, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and distinctive umbellate inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica, and thrives in moist, calcareous soils. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to greenish flowers clustered in umbrella-like shapes. Its seeds are small, dry, and often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that the plant contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
