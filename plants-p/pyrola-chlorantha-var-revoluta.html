                    <h1>Pyrola chlorantha var. revoluta</h1>
<p>Pyrola chlorantha var. revoluta, commonly known as the revolute white wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in late winter or early spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in cold, moist environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its revolute (rolled under) leaf margins, a key morphological feature that aids in its identification.</p>
