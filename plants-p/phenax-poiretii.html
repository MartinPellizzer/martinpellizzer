<p>Phenax poiretii, commonly known as the French orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of southern France.</p>

The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky crevices or forest undergrowth. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phenax poiretii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
