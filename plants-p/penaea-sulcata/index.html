                            <h1>Penaea Sulcata</h1>
<p>Coral tree, scientifically known as Penaea sulcata, is a striking ornamental plant native to southern Africa. Its vibrant red flowers resemble coral, giving it its common name and making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. The tree thrives in warm climates and is often used in urban settings for its visual appeal and ability to provide shade. It is also valued for its adaptability to various soil types and its drought tolerance. Despite its beauty, the coral tree requires proper care to ensure it flourishes and maintains its distinctive appearance.</p>
