                    <h1>Poa flabellata var. antarctica</h1>
<p>Poa flabellata var. antarctica, commonly known as Antarctic hairgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass native to the cold climates of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, windy environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is particularly adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited nutrients.</p>
<p>This variety is an important component of Antarctic and sub-Antarctic ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
