<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces striking, pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers during late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as heathlands and sandy soils. It has a short-lived rhizome and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Prasophyllum constrictum is an important component of the local flora and is often found in conservation reserves.</p>
