<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a star-like pattern on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizome is creeping and produces a dense network of roots.</p>
<p>The spores are borne in sori that are clustered in a unique, star-shaped arrangement, contributing to its common name.</p>
