                    <h1>Potentilla nivalis f. subglabrescens</h1>
<p>Potentilla nivalis f. subglabrescens, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically has silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions. Its compact growth habit and frost-resistant nature make it well adapted to rocky and barren soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
