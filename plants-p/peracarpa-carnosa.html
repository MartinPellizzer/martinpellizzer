                <h1>Peracarpa carnosa</h1>
<p>Peracarpa carnosa, commonly known as the fleshy-fruited bush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, succulent stems and leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically red or orange in color, which contain the seeds. These fruits are often eaten by birds and small mammals, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Peracarpa carnosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
