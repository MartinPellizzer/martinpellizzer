                    <h1>Paspalum meziibrunneum</h1>
<p>Paspalum meziibrunneum, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of eastern and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments or along shorelines.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience to salt spray and coastal conditions, it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
