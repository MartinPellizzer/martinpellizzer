                    <h1>Plantago major var. rigidifolia</h1>
<p>Plantago major var. rigidifolia, commonly known as rigid-leaved plantain, is a variant of the common plantain characterized by its stiff, upright leaves.</p>
<p>This perennial herb is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and have a rough, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typically in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its healing benefits.</p>
