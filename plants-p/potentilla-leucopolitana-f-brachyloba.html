                    <h1>Potentilla leucopolitana f. brachyloba</h1>
<p>Potentilla leucopolitana f. brachyloba, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
