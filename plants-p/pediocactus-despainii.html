                    <h1>Pediocactus despainii</h1>
<p>Pediocactus despainii, commonly known as the Desert Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
