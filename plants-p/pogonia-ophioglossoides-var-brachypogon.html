                    <h1>Pogonia ophioglossoides var. brachypogon</h1>
<p>Pogonia ophioglossoides var. brachypogon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf adder's mouth, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, hooded labellum that resembles a snake's head, a feature that contributes to its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and requires specific soil conditions to thrive. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, and it produces small, elliptical seed pods.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
