                    <h1>Paronychia frutescens</h1>
<p>Paronychia frutescens, commonly known as the sticky saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, white or pink flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>The sticky resin also serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
