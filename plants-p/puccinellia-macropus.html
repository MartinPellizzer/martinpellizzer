<p>Puccinellia macropus, commonly known as the large-seeded bulrush, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in saline or alkaline soils, making it an important component of stabilized dunes and wetland margins.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions contributes to its ecological significance in desert and coastal ecosystems.</p>
