<p>Pulsatilla patens subsp.</p>
<p>teklae, commonly known as the Tekla pasqueflower, is a rare and delicate perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its early spring bloom of showy, pinkish-white flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
