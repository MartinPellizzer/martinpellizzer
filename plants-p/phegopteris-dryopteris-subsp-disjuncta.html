<p>Phegopteris dryopteris subsp.</p>
<p>disjuncta, commonly known as the Disjunct lady fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes, preferring cool and humid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant has a unique morphology with a short, thick rhizome and fronds that are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. Its spores are released from small, clustered sorus structures on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native habitats.</p>
