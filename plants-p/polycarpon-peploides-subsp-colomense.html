<p>Polycarpon peploides subsp.</p>
<p>colomense, commonly known as the Andean sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are hairy and adapted to reduce water loss, a trait common in alpine flora.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
