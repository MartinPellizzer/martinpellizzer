                    <h1>Prunus serotina f. alabamensis</h1>
<p>Prunus serotina f. alabamensis, commonly known as the Alabama cherry, is a rare and unique form of the black cherry tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinct morphological features, including smaller leaves and a more compact growth habit compared to the typical Prunus serotina. This form is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Alabama and neighboring regions. The plant produces small, dark red cherries that are edible but not as commonly consumed as other cherry varieties.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic variant that contributes to the biodiversity of the Prunus genus.</p>
