<p>Pavate, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. Its seeds are encased in a hard, three-lobed capsule, which splits open when mature to release the seeds.</p>
<p>Pavate is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
