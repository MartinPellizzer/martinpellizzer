<p>Polygonum viviparum f. ramosum, commonly known as the ramose knotweed, is a flowering plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dense, spreading foliage.</p>
<p>It features small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, typical of the Polygonaceae family. The plant is notable for its ability to produce adventitious roots from its nodes, enabling vegetative propagation. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and roadside areas.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
