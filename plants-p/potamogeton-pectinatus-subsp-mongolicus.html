<p>Potamogeton pectinatus subsp.</p>
<p>mongolicus, commonly known as Mongolian pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Asia. It has long, slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, often with a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which emerge above the water surface. It is adapted to slow-moving or still waters and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its morphology and distribution make it an important species for studies on wetland ecology and plant adaptation.</p>
