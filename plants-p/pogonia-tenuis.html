                    <h1>Pogonia tenuis</h1>
<p>Pogonia tenuis, commonly known as the slender bog orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and swamps, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces striking, pale pink to white flowers with intricate patterns. Its reproductive strategy relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological interdependence.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Pogonia tenuis is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
