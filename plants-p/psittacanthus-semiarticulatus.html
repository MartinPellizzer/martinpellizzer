<p>Psittacanthus semiarticulatus, commonly known as the articulated fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance.

Its rhizomes are wiry and capable of anchoring the plant in place while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens and ponds.</p>
