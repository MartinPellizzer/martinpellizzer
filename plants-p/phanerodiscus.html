                    <h1>Phanerodiscus</h1>
<p>Phanerodiscus, commonly known as the showy disc lichen, is a type of lichen that belongs to the family Caloplacaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, disc-shaped thallus with a smooth, bright surface that often displays vibrant colors such as yellow, orange, or red. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in various environmental conditions. Phanerodiscus is typically found on rocks, tree bark, or soil surfaces in temperate and tropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in lichenology and ecological studies.</p>
