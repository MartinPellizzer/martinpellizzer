                    <h1>Polygonum foliosum</h1>
<p>Polygonum foliosum, commonly known as the Indian nettle or velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Asia.</p>
<p>It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late summer. Polygonum foliosum thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in cultivated settings.</p>
