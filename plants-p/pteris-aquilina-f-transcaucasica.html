<p>Pteris aquilina f. transcaucasica, commonly known as the Transcaucasian water fern, is a fern species native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and slightly curled. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity.</p>
