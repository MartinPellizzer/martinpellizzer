                    <h1>Polygonum aubertii</h1>
<p>Polygonum aubertii, commonly known as the Japanese knotweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread rapidly and become invasive in non-native regions. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a noxious weed in many parts of the world.</p>
