                    <h1>Potentilla hypargyrea var. pellita</h1>
<p>Potentilla hypargyrea var. pellita, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rocky or alpine gardens.</p>
<p>Its compact size and ornamental appeal make it a popular plant for landscaping in dry, sunny conditions.</p>
