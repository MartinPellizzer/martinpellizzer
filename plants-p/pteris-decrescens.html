                    <h1>Pteris decrescens</h1>
<p>Pteris decrescens, commonly known as the creeping water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a dense, carpet-like growth pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks or in damp forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming colonies.</p>
<p>Pteris decrescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in aquatic gardens or as a ground cover in humid climates.</p>
