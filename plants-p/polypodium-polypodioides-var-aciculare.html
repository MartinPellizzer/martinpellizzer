<p>Polypodium polypodioides var. aciculare, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a variant of the common polypody.</p>
<p>It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its narrow, needle-like fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in rocky or shaded areas, often on cliffs or in woodland habitats. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to substrates, while its fronds are usually arranged in a compact rosette.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
