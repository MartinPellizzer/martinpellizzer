                    <h1>Plantago holostea</h1>
<p>Plantago holostea, commonly known as sea plantain, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or greenish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines, where it is adapted to salty and windy conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas along the coast.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
