                    <h1>Potentilla ruprechtii var. aurea</h1>
<p>Potentilla ruprechtii var. aurea, commonly known as the golden potentilla, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a vibrant splash of color to gardens. The plant has finely divided, silvery-green leaves that provide an attractive foliage contrast. It is well-suited for rock gardens and dry, well-drained soils due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from both its showy flowers and its hardy, low-maintenance nature.</p>
