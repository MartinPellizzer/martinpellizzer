                    <h1>Potamogeton × nitens f. restrictus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × nitens f. restrictus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pondweed, is a hybrid plant species belonging to the family Potamogetonaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and is typically found in freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant is submerged or floating, with small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its morphological variability, it can be challenging to distinguish from its parent species in the field.</p>
