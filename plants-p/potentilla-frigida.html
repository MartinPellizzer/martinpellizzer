                    <h1>Potentilla frigida</h1>
<p>Potentilla frigida, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in cold, rocky, and well-drained soils, often found in tundra and mountainous environments. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Potentilla frigida plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic animals.</p>
