                    <h1>Phaius</h1>
<p>Phaius, commonly known as the white ginger orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines. They are characterized by their tall, grass-like leaves and showy, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Phaius species are often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Their ornamental value has made them popular in horticulture, though they require specific care to flourish.</p>
