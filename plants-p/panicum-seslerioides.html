<p>Panicum seslerioides, commonly known as the silver panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and silvery-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant produces panicles of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and drought tolerance.</p>
