<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of fragrant, violet-colored flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Pyrorchis forrestii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
