                    <h1>Poa procumbens</h1>
<p>Poa procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth on the ground, often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it resilient in various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Poa procumbens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small organisms.</p>
