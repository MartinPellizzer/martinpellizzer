                <h1>Pedilonum calcarium</h1>
<p>Pedilonum calcarium, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant that thrives in calcareous soils.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that often resemble miniature orchids. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich environments, where it forms symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the mineral-rich substrates, allowing it to flourish in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Pedilonum calcarium is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitats.</p>
