<p>Pteridrys confertiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices.
