                    <h1>Potamica</h1>
<p>Potamica, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, feathery fronds that often float on the surface of water or grow submerged. Potamica species are typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams and rivers. They play a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and aiding in water filtration.</p>
<p>Their ability to thrive in moist environments makes them important indicators of water quality and ecological health.</p>
