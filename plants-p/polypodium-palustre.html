<p>Polypodium palustre, commonly known as the marsh holly fern, is a terrestrial fern native to wetland and swampy habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce clusters of small, dark green, leathery fronds. The fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often curled at the tips. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
