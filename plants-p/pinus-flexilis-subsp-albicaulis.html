<p>Pinus flexilis subsp.</p>
<p>albicaulis, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a subspecies native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive white bark, which is covered in a layer of thick, scaly skin.</p>
<p>The tree typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in subalpine or alpine environments. Its cones are serotinous, meaning they remain closed until exposed to heat from a fire, allowing for seed dispersal after a wildfire.</p>
<p>This adaptation makes it an important component of fire-prone ecosystems.</p>
