<p>Pleopeltis paucijuga, commonly known as the few-leafed rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rock surfaces or in forest understories. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with closely spaced, ovate to lanceolate leaves. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, narrow, and sometimes recurved shape.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid, shaded habitats.</p>
