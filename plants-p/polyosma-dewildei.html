<p>Polyosma dewildei, commonly known as the Dewilde's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the rainforests of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients from the host while also performing photosynthesis. Its small, oval-shaped leaves are usually arranged in whorls, and it produces small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, berry-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to potential host trees.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth habit and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
