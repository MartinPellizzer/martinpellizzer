                    <h1>Piper stoloniferum</h1>
<p>Piper stoloniferum, commonly known as the creeping pepper vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by small, round berries containing the seeds. Its stolons, or horizontal stems, allow it to spread across the ground and climb structures, making it an effective ground cover.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a slightly rough texture, with a strong, peppery aroma when crushed.</p>
