                    <h1>Panicum effusum var. subleiophyllum</h1>
<p>Panicum effusum var. subleiophyllum, commonly known as silvergrass, is a variant of the panic grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, silky hairs on its leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils, and it thrives in well-drained sandy or loamy soils. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leaves, and it produces small, fluffy panicles that release wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This grass is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and drought tolerance.</p>
