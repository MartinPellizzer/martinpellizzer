<p>Pilocereus arenicola, commonly known as the sand hedge cactus, is a species of cactus native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that grow close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, enabling survival in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Pilocereus arenicola is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited rainfall.</p>
