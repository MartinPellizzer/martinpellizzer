<p>Pyrrhocactus armatus, commonly known as the armed pyrrhocactus, is a unique cactus species native to the deserts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, spiny bracts that provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized desert gardens.</p>
