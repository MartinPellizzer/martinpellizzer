<p>Proatriplex pleiantha, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in saline soils and is capable of tolerating high levels of soil salinity.</p>
<p>Proatriplex pleiantha plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
