<p>Phleum gibbum, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in moist, temperate environments.</p>
<p>It has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in shaded woodland areas.

<p>Phleum gibbum is also a valuable forage plant for livestock.</p>
