<p>It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize various habitats.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and other damp environments.</p>
