<p>Polystichum neozelandicum subsp.</p>
<p>neozelandicum, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a tall, evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It features a tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy material called the rachis.</p>
<p>The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
