<p>Praxeliopsis mattogrossensis, commonly known as the Brazilian star moss, is a unique liverwort species native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves arranged in a star-like pattern. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found on decaying wood or in rocky crevices. Its structure is highly adapted to retain moisture, which is essential for its survival in the humid tropical climate.</p>
<p>Praxeliopsis mattogrossensis plays a minor but important role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
