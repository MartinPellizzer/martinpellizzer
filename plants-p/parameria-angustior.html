                    <h1>Parameria angustior</h1>
<p>Parameria angustior, commonly known as the narrow-leaved parameria, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun exposure. Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers, which appear in late summer, are small and yellow, forming a compact cluster that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
