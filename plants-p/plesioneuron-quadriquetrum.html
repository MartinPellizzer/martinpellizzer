<p>Plesioneuron quadriquetrum, commonly known as the four-branch liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, branched thallus that forms dense, cushion-like growths on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of a flattened, ribbon-like structure called a thallus. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are borne on the upper surface of the thallus and produce both male and female reproductive organs.</p>
<p>Plesioneuron quadriquetrum is typically found in temperate regions, often in forest floors or on rocks, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich environments.</p>
