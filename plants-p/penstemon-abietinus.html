<p>Penstemon abietinus, commonly known as the white beard scale penstemon, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, white to pale blue tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense, white felt-like coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Penstemon abietinus is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
