<p>Phloeophila nummularia, commonly known as the silverleaf daphne, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in gardens across temperate regions.</p>
