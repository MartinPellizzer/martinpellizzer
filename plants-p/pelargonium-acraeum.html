<p>Pelargonium acraeum, commonly known as the Cape marigold, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, Pelargonium acraeum is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
