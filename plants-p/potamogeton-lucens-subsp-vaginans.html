<p>Potamogeton lucens subsp.</p>
<p>vaginans, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. It features long, slender, ribbon-like leaves that are usually less than 1 millimeter wide, often with a distinct midrib.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, green flowers that are arranged in dense clusters, typically emerging from the water surface. Its rhizomes are well-developed, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense underwater stands.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
