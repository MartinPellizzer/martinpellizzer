<p>Pinus mugo subsp.</p>
<p>uliginosa, commonly known as the bog pine, is a subspecies of the mountain pine native to northern Europe and parts of Siberia. It is a small, shrub-like conifer that typically grows in wet, acidic soils, often in peat bogs or heathlands.</p>
<p>The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, forming dense, low-growing clumps. Its needles are dark green and remain on the plant for several years before shedding.</p>
<p>The cones are small and typically open to release their seeds, contributing to its role in forest succession and ecological stability.</p>
