<p>Pseudocytisus integrifolius subsp.</p>
<p>ibericus, commonly known as the Iberian broom, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often sparsely branched stems and small, leathery leaves that are typically entire.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats like scrublands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
