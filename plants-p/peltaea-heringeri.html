                    <h1>Peltaea heringeri</h1>
<p>Peltaea heringeri, commonly known as the Heringer's shieldflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and clusters of small, fleshy, shield-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in rocky or limestone soils.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and restricted range make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
