                    <h1>Phragmites australis var. humilis</h1>
<p>Phragmites australis var. humilis, commonly known as the tall reed, is a variant of the common reed that is typically shorter and more compact than its taller relative.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments, including marshes, ponds, and the edges of lakes. This plant has long, narrow leaves and produces dense clusters of small, fluffy flowers during the summer months. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and form dense stands in suitable wetland habitats.</p>
