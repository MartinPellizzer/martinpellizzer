<p>Polystichum lonchitis, commonly known as the long-leaf fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with lance-shaped, dark green leaves that have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a fiddle-shaped indusium.</p>
<p>Polystichum lonchitis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is commonly used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shaded garden settings.</p>
