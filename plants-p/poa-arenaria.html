                    <h1>Poa arenaria</h1>
<p>Poa arenaria, commonly known as sand bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted shoots and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to sandy and coastal environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, which aid in its propagation across open, disturbed sites. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, coastal sands, and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, Poa arenaria is an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
