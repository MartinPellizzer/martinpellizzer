<p>Penstemon crandallii var. ramaleyi, commonly known as the ramalyleaf beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often have a silvery or grayish coating, which provides additional protection from intense sunlight.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
