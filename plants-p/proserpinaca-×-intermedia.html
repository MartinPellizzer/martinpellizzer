                    <h1>Proserpinaca × intermedia</h1>
<p>Proserpinaca × intermedia, commonly known as the hybrid sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Proserpinaca lutea and Proserpinaca maritima, resulting in a plant with distinctive blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. Its foliage is typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh coastal environment.</p>
<p>Proserpinaca × intermedia is often found in maritime climates and is valued for its ornamental appeal in coastal gardens.</p>
