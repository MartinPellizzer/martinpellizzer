<p>Pagesia peduncularis, commonly known as the slender-fruit sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are typically pale green to yellowish, arranged in clusters at the ends of slender stems.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, contributing to its dispersal in harsh environments.</p>
