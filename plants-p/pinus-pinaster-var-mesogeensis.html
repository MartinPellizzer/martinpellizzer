<p>Pinus pinaster var. mesogeensis, commonly known as the Greek maritime pine, is a variant of the Aleppo pine native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of the standard Pinus pinaster. The cones of this variety are generally smaller and more elongated, with a distinctive reddish-brown color. It thrives in coastal and mountainous areas, adapting well to saline and rocky soils.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife.</p>
