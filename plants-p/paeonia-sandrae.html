                    <h1>Paeonia sandrae</h1>
<p>Paeonia sandrae, commonly known as the Sandra peony, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to deep pink, with a subtle fragrance. The leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets arranged in an alternating pattern. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a period of cold dormancy to bloom properly.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Paeonia sandrae is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
