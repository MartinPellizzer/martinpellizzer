                    <h1>Pyrus malus lusus pendula</h1>
<p>Pyrus malus lusus pendula, commonly known as the weeping apple tree, is a cultivar of the apple tree characterized by its distinctive cascading branches.</p>
<p>This ornamental tree features a unique, drooping growth habit that gives it a graceful, almost ethereal appearance. The leaves are typically dark green and oval-shaped, while the flowers are white and fragrant, appearing in spring. The fruit is smaller than standard apples and often has a tart flavor, though it is primarily grown for its aesthetic value rather than for consumption.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth.</p>
