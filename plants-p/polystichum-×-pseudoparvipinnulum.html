                    <h1>Polystichum × pseudoparvipinnulum</h1>
<p>Polystichum × pseudoparvipinnulum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sword fern, is a hybrid fern species that exhibits characteristics of its parent species, Polystichum parvipinnulum and Polystichum smithii.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are densely packed and often have a dark green, leathery texture. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens.</p>
