<p>Pinus cembroides subsp.</p>
<p>orizabensis, commonly known as the Orizaba pine, is a subspecies of the Mexican pine native to high-altitude regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and conical shape, adapted to thrive in cooler, drier climates.</p>
<p>The tree produces cones that contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It plays a significant role in the ecological stability of its native habitat, contributing to soil retention and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, this subspecies is also considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
