<p>Pityrogramma argentea, commonly known as the silver water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery coating, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in dense undergrowth. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Pteridophyta division.</p>
<p>The plant's unique appearance and adaptability make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>
