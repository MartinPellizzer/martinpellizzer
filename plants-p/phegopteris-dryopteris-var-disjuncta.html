                    <h1>Phegopteris dryopteris var. disjuncta</h1>
<p>Phegopteris dryopteris var. disjuncta, commonly known as the Disjunct Shield Fern, is a variant of the shield fern found in specific alpine and subalpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, divided fronds that resemble a shield, with a unique disjunctive pattern in its leaflets. The plant typically grows in rocky or moist soil environments at high elevations. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological adaptations.</p>
