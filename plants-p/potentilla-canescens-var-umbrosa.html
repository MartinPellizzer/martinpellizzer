<p>Potentilla canescens var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a silvery underside, and it produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in early summer. Its stems are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
