                    <h1>Plantago hirtella var. orbignyana</h1>
<p>Plantago hirtella var. orbignyana, commonly known as the hairy plantain, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers at the tips of the stems, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This species is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions.</p>
