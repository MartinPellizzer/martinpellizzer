                    <h1>Polypodium farinosum</h1>
<p>Polypodium farinosum, commonly known as the powdered fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear in a compact, clustered form. The plant thrives in humid environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread across substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
