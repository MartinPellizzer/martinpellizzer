                    <h1>Polygonum polycephalum</h1>
<p>Polygonum polycephalum, commonly known as the "Chinese everlasting" or "water plantain," is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant is adapted to moist environments, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Polygonum polycephalum is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
