<p>Pycnandra kaalaensis, commonly known as the Kaalaena tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Pacific Islands, particularly in French Polynesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is often found in coastal or lowland forests and is adapted to humid, tropical climates.</p>
<p>The plant has limited ecological and economic importance but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution.</p>
