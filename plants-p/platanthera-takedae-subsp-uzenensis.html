<p>Platanthera takedae subsp.</p>
<p>uzenensis, commonly known as the Uzen marsh twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in wet, shaded habitats such as marshes and mountainous wetlands. It has narrow, linear leaves and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
