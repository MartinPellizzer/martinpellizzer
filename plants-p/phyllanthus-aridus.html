                    <h1>Phyllanthus aridus</h1>
<p>Phyllanthus aridus, commonly known as the desert phyllanthus, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Phyllanthus aridus is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine.</p>
