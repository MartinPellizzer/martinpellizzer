                    <h1>Pereskia amapola</h1>
<p>Pereskia amapola, commonly known as the "Mexican snowball" or "star apple," is a unique cactus species native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, woody stems covered in soft, leafy structures that resemble leaves, making it appear more like a shrub than a typical cactus. The plant produces showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a snowball, hence its common name. Its fruits are small, round, and edible, with a sweet, juicy pulp that has a mild, tropical flavor.</p>
<p>Despite its cactus classification, Pereskia amapola is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
