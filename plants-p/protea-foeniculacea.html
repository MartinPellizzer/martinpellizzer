                    <h1>Protea foeniculacea</h1>
<p>Protea foeniculacea, commonly known as the sweet cycad, is a striking plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and distinctive, showy inflorescences. The plant produces a unique, spore-bearing structure called a strobilus, which is often mistaken for a flower. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments.</p>
