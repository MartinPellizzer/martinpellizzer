                    <h1>Papaver somniferum f. dissectum</h1>
<p>Papaver somniferum f. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected opium poppy, is a botanical variant of the opium poppy characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves.</p>
<p>This cultivar is primarily grown for ornamental purposes due to its striking, delicate foliage rather than for its medicinal or narcotic properties. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>However, due to its relation to the opium poppy, it is subject to legal restrictions in many regions.</p>
