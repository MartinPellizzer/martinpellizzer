                    <h1>Phaeocephalum tracyi</h1>
<p>Phaeocephalum tracyi, commonly known as Tracy's ghostplant, is a rare and enigmatic member of the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to brownish foliage that appears almost translucent, giving it a ghostly appearance. This fern-like plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its spore-producing structures are small and clustered, contributing to its elusive nature.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat requirements, Phaeocephalum tracyi is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
