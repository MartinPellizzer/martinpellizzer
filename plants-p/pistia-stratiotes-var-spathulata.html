                    <h1>Pistia stratiotes var. spathulata</h1>
<p>Pistia stratiotes var. spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically light green to reddish in color, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom above the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native habitats, impacting local ecosystems.</p>
