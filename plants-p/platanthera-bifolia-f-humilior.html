                    <h1>Platanthera bifolia f. humilior</h1>
<p>Platanthera bifolia f. humilior, commonly known as the lowland lady's tresses, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and a dense, fragrant inflorescence of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, often near streams or in damp soils. Its growth is closely tied to specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
