                    <h1>Pogonia quadricallosa</h1>
<p>Pogonia quadricallosa, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive pink or purple pouch-like labellum, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic woodlands and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a threatened species in many areas.</p>
