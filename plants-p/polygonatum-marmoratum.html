<p>Polygonatum marmoratum, commonly known as the marble-stemmed Solomon's seal, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, marble-like patterning on its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early summer, followed by red berries that ripen in the fall. It thrives in shaded, moist woodland environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Polygonatum marmoratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and ecological benefits.</p>
