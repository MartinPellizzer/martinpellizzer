<p>Phalaenopsis schilleriana var. vestalis, commonly known as the Schiller's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elegant, long-lasting flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>The flowers are often used in horticultural displays due to their beauty and longevity.</p>
