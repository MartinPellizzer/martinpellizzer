<p>Pyrostria suarezensis, commonly known as the Suarez's pyrostria, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andes of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cavity. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red and orange. It thrives in high-altitude cloud forests, where it relies on specific microclimatic conditions for survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
