                    <h1>Populus tremula f. rthensis</h1>
<p>Populus tremula f. rthensis, commonly known as the trembling aspen or European aspen, is a variant of the aspen tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that tremble in the wind due to the presence of flexible petioles. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, temperate forests.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its use in traditional crafts and medicine.</p>
