<p>Ptarmica borealis, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Ptarmica borealis has a compact growth form, typically reaching only a few centimeters in height.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in extreme cold and low light conditions makes it an important component of polar ecosystems.</p>
