                    <h1>Parietaria nummularia</h1>
<p>Parietaria nummularia, commonly known as the silverleaf plant or money plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest size. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on walls or in rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its foliage is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies, though its allergenic properties can make it a problematic plant in certain settings.</p>
