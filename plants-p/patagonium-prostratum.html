                    <h1>Patagonium prostratum</h1>
<p>Patagonium prostratum, commonly known as the Patagonian prostrate grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southern regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that form a dense mat on the ground, often found in rocky or arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Patagonium prostratum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
