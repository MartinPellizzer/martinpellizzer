The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, white flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
