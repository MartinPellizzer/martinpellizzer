<p>Poa sergievskajae, commonly known as the Sergeyevskaya bluegrass, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of the Russian Far East.</p>
<p>This grass is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, dark green blades. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Poa sergievskajae is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of scientific interest.</p>
