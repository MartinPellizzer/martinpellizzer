                    <h1>Psychrophila</h1>
<p>Psychrophila, commonly known as the cold-loving plant, is a genus of flowering plants that thrives in temperate and cold climates.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their ability to withstand low temperatures and often grow in regions with harsh winters. Psychrophila species typically have compact growth habits and are adapted to nutrient-poor soils. They often bloom in late spring or early summer when temperatures rise.</p>
<p>The genus is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role in cold ecosystems.</p>
