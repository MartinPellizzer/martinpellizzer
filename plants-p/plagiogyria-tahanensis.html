                    <h1>Plagiogyria tahanensis</h1>
<p>Plagiogyria tahanensis, commonly known as the Tahan mountain moss, is a rare and specialized fern found in specific high-altitude habitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds with a dense, moss-like growth structure. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it an important subject for botanical research.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial due to its vulnerability to habitat loss and climate change.</p>
