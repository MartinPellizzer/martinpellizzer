                    <h1>Pyrus calleryana var. fauriei</h1>
<p>Pyrus calleryana var. fauriei, commonly known as the Chinese white ash, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by round, fuzzy fruits that ripen in late summer. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
<p>However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through bird-dispersed seeds.</p>
