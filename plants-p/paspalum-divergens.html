<p>Paspalum divergens, commonly known as the creeping paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along waterways.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in moist conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
