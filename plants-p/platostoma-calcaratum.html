                    <h1>Platostoma calcaratum</h1>
<p>Platostoma calcaratum, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in rocky, often shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to the substrate. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, with the algae providing photosynthetic energy and the fungi offering structural support and protection. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing on soil, rock, or tree bark.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for air quality.</p>
