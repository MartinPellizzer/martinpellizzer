<p>Petasites speciosus var. frigidus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The leaves are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
