<p>Pedicularis longiflora subsp.</p>
<p>longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered lousewort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that resemble louse-like structures, hence its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or meadow habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, attracting specific insects that aid in its reproduction.</p>
