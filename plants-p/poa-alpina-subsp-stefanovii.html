<p>Poa alpina subsp.</p>
<p>stefanovii, commonly known as the Stefanov's alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the European Alps. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
