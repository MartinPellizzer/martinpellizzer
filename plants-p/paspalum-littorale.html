                    <h1>Paspalum littorale</h1>
<p>Paspalum littorale, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, saline soils and is often found in dune ecosystems and tidal marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny flowers. It is well adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding, making it an important pioneer species in coastal restoration.</p>
<p>Its dense growth helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion along shorelines.</p>
