<p>Prenanthes gracilipes, commonly known as slender swampweed, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with alternate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose racemes and bloom in late summer.</p>
