<p>Phoradendron belizense, commonly known as the Belize mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its smooth, evergreen foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, are an important food source for various bird species.</p>
<p>The Belize mistletoe plays a role in the ecosystem by contributing to the biodiversity of forest canopies and supporting wildlife.</p>
