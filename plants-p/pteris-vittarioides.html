<p>Pteris vittarioides, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating in water, adapting it to aquatic environments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
<p>Pteris vittarioides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lacy appearance.</p>
