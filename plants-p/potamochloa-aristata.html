                    <h1>Potamochloa aristata</h1>
<p>Potamochloa aristata, commonly known as the river sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and riparian habitats in South America.</p>
<p>It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in moist to aquatic environments and is often found in marshes, streambanks, and floodplains. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in waterlogged areas.</p>
<p>Potamochloa aristata plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife in its native habitats.</p>
