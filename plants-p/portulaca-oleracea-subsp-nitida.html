<p>Portulaca oleracea subsp.</p>
<p>nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf purslane, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and nutritional value, it is sometimes cultivated as a leafy vegetable.</p>
