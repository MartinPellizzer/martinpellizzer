                    <h1>Pratia gelida</h1>
<p>Pratia gelida, commonly known as the frozen pratia, is a rare and hardy plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and compact growth habit, adapted to withstand extreme cold and low oxygen levels. The plant produces tiny, pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle beauty to its harsh environment. Pratia gelida is often found in rocky crevices and alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
