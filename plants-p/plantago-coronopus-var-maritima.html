                    <h1>Plantago coronopus var. maritima</h1>
<p>Plantago coronopus var. maritima, commonly known as sea plantain, is a coastal plant adapted to sandy and salty environments.</p>
<p>It has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, white wax layer to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is found along shorelines and dunes in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other Plantago species but is distinguished by its salt tolerance and specific habitat preferences.</p>
