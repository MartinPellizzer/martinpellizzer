                    <h1>Phyllamphora</h1>
<p>Phyllamphora, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, flat, and often brightly colored thalli, which can range from green to yellow or red. They typically grow on moist, shaded surfaces such as rocks, soil, or decaying wood in temperate regions. Phyllamphora species are non-vascular plants, meaning they lack true roots, stems, and leaves, and rely on diffusion for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Their simple structure and vibrant colors make them popular in horticultural settings as ornamental mosses.</p>
