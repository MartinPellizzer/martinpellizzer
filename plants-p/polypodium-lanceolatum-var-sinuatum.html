                    <h1>Polypodium lanceolatum var. sinuatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium lanceolatum var. sinuatum, commonly known as the serrate holly fern, is a fern species native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that produce new shoots. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue light at night, which aids in attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique feature makes it a distinctive and ecologically important plant in its native habitats.</p>
