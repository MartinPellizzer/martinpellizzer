                    <h1>Pinus flexilis var. alpina</h1>
<p>Pinus flexilis var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine flexible pine, is a variant of the flexible pine native to high-altitude regions of western North America.</p>
<p>This evergreen conifer is characterized by its slender, often contorted growth habit, which helps it adapt to harsh alpine conditions. Its needles are typically short, stiff, and dark green, providing efficient photosynthesis in low-light environments. The cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variety plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat in mountainous ecosystems.</p>
