                    <h1>Populus × triangularis</h1>
<p>Populus × triangularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved poplar, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often weeping form and heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of other poplar species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
