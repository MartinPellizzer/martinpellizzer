<p>Panax commersonii, commonly known as the Commerson's ginseng, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered growth habit and palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries containing several seeds. It is valued for its roots, which are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
