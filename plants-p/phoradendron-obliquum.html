                    <h1>Phoradendron obliquum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron obliquum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the sunlight it captures. The plant forms a dense, evergreen shrub with small, oval-shaped leaves and white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are an important food source for birds, which then disperse the seeds.</p>
<p>This unique relationship between the mistletoe and its host plays a significant role in forest ecosystems.</p>
