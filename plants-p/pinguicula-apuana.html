                    <h1>Pinguicula apuana</h1>
<p>Pinguicula apuana, commonly known as the Apuan butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of Italy.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Pinguicula apuana plays a role in its ecosystem by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
