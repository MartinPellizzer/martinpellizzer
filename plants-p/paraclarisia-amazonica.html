<p>Paraclarisia amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian moon moth, is a species of moth native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Erebidae and is characterized by its striking, iridescent wings that display a mix of blue, green, and silver hues. The plant associated with this moth, though not a plant itself, is often found in the dense undergrowth of the Amazonian canopy, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host plants, which provide nourishment for its larvae.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable, highlighting the importance of preserving its ecological niche.</p>
