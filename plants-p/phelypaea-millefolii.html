<p>Phelypaea millefolii, commonly known as the common water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>

The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often used in ornamental water gardens.</p>
<p>Phelypaea millefolii plays a role in water purification by absorbing nutrients and improving water clarity.</p>
