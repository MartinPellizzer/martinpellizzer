                    <h1>Parodia ritteri</h1>
<p>Parodia ritteri, commonly known as the "Cactus of the Desert," is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, columnar stems covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its compact size and striking appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections.</p>
<p>Parodia ritteri is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems for survival in harsh environments.</p>
