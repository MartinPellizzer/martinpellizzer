                    <h1>Polypodium virginianum f. subsimplex</h1>
<p>Polypodium virginianum f. subsimplex, commonly known as the small-leaf rock fern, is a fern species characterized by its compact, low-growing habit.</p>
<p>It features dark green, leathery fronds that are typically shorter and more narrow than those of the typical variety. The fronds are divided into pinnae that are closely spaced and have a subtle, almost linear appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories.</p>
<p>This form is a natural variant of the broader Polypodium virginianum species, showcasing genetic diversity within the genus.</p>
