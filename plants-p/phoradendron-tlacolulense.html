                    <h1>Phoradendron tlacolulense</h1>
<p>Phoradendron tlacolulense, commonly known as the Mexican mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the southern United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host tree's bark. It plays a significant role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Its presence can also influence the health and growth of its host trees.</p>
