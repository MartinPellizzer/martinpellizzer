<p>Pteris trattinickiana, commonly known as the bog fern, is a species of fern native to wetland and swampy habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in areas with high humidity and partial shade. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Pteris trattinickiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
