                    <h1>Polysphaeria multiflora</h1>
<p>Polysphaeria multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered globe cactus, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, globular shape and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Polysphaeria multiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates.</p>
