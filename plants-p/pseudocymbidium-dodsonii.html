                    <h1>Pseudocymbidium dodsonii</h1>
<p>Pseudocymbidium dodsonii, commonly known as the Dodson's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often curved flower spike that bears a single, pale green to white flower with a distinctive, hood-like structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, and it is known for its minimalistic and delicate appearance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and its rarity, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
