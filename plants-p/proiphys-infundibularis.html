<p>Proiphys infundibularis, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive hood-like structure formed by the fusion of the sepals and petals, giving it a unique and elegant appearance. Native to the humid tropical regions of South America, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments within dense forests. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pale yellow.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Proiphys infundibularis is considered a delicate and endangered species.</p>
