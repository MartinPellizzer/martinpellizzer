                    <h1>Phthirusa theobromae</h1>
<p>Phthirusa theobromae, commonly known as the cocoa mealybug, is a small, sap-sucking insect that primarily infests cacao plants.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pseudococcidae and is characterized by its fluffy, waxy secretions that cover its body. The plant's botanical aspects are most relevant in its role as a host for this pest, particularly in tropical regions where cacao is cultivated. The mealybug feeds on the plant's sap, causing stunted growth and reduced yields.</p>
<p>Its presence can also lead to the spread of plant pathogens, making it a significant concern for agricultural sustainability.</p>
