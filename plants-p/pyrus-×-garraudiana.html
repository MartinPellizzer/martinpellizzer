                    <h1>Pyrus × garraudiana</h1>
<p>Pyrus × garraudiana, commonly known as the hybrid pear, is a deciduous tree that belongs to the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Pyrus communis (European pear) and Pyrus pyraster (wild pear), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parents. The tree typically grows to a height of 5–10 meters and produces oval, green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its flowers are white and clustered, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, yellowish pear that is not typically cultivated for commercial use but is of interest in botanical studies.</p>
