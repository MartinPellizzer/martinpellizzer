                    <h1>Plantago tomentosa var. cordobensis</h1>
<p>Plantago tomentosa var. cordobensis, commonly known as the Cordoban plantain, is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly Argentina.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of broad, hairy, and waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces erect, branched flowering shoots that bear small, greenish flowers in early spring. Its seeds are enclosed in capsules that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
