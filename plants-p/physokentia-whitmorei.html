<p>Physokentia whitmorei, commonly known as the Whitmore's cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically important for conservation efforts.</p>
