                    <h1>Puya lehmanniana</h1>
<p>Puya lehmanniana, commonly known as the Lehmann's torchflower, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that resembles a torch, with vibrant red and orange bracts that attract pollinators. The plant forms a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Puya lehmanniana is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
