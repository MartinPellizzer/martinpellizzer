                    <h1>Pterospermadendron heterophyllum</h1>
<p>Pterospermadendron heterophyllum, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing elliptical seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and construction.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable to extinction.</p>
