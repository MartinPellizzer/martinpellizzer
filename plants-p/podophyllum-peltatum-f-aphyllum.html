                    <h1>Podophyllum peltatum f. aphyllum</h1>
<p>Podophyllum peltatum f. aphyllum, commonly known as the white mayapple, is a variant of the mayapple plant characterized by its lack of the typical leaf lobes found in the species.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a more rounded, shield-shaped leaf that is predominantly white to pale green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into red berries, which are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental plant in horticulture.</p>
