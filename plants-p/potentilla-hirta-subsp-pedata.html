<p>Potentilla hirta subsp.</p>
<p>pedata, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features wiry, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
