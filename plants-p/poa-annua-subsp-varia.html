<p>Poa annua subsp.</p>
<p>varia, commonly known as the variable annual bluegrass, is a cool-season grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, including sandy and loamy soils. It is often found in disturbed areas such as lawns, roadsides, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can be both a desirable turfgrass and a weed, depending on the context.</p>
