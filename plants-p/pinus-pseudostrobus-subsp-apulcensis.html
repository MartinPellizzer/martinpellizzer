<p>Pinus pseudostrobus subsp.</p>
<p>apulcensis, commonly known as the Apulcense Pinyon, is a rare subspecies of the Mexican pinyon pine. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and conical shape, typical of many pine species.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to specific regions in Mexico, where it thrives in dry, mountainous environments. Its cones are small and often remain closed for extended periods, a feature that aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>The plant plays a vital ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
