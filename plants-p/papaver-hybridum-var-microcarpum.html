                    <h1>Papaver hybridum var. microcarpum</h1>
<p>Papaver hybridum var. microcarpum, commonly known as the miniature poppy, is a compact, flowering plant characterized by its small, delicate flowers and unique seed pods.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is known for its vibrant, often red or orange petals that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10â€“20 centimeters, making it ideal for rock gardens or container planting. Its flowers are short-lived, lasting only a few days, but they are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The seed pods, which are smaller than those of other poppy species, mature into a distinctive, round structure that splits open to release the seeds.</p>
