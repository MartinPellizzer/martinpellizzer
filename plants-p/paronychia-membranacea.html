                    <h1>Paronychia membranacea</h1>
<p>Paronychia membranacea, commonly known as the parchment sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a thin, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its succulent leaves and drought-tolerant nature make it well adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping.</p>
