                    <h1>Parodia</h1>
<p>Parodia, commonly known as the "Moon Cactus," is a genus of cacti native to South America.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their compact, globular shape and are often cultivated for their ornamental value. Parodia species typically have a dense covering of white or pale spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. They thrive in well-draining soil and require minimal water, making them ideal for succulent gardens.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Parodia hillebrandii, which is particularly popular among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
