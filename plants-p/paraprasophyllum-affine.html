The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, thriving in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, often found in remote and inaccessible areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies in its native range.</p>
