<p>Polypodium senile var. minus, commonly known as the small-leaf hart's-tongue fern, is a variant of the hart's-tongue fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its narrow, leathery, and evergreen fronds that remain on the plant year-round. The fronds are typically short and curling, with a distinctive shape that resembles a tongue or a heart. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in woodland areas.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients.</p>
