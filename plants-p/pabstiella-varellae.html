                    <h1>Pabstiella varellae</h1>
<p>Pabstiella varellae, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a rare and specialized plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, and its leaves are typically succulent to store water. Pabstiella varellae thrives in sandy soils and is often found in areas with minimal rainfall and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
