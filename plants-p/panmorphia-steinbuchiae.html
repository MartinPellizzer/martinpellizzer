<p>Panmorphia steinbuchiae, commonly known as the Steinbuch's panmorph, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and sorrel species. The plant is characterized by its striking, multicolored bracts that resemble a flower cluster, though it produces small, inconspicuous true flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
