                    <h1>Pappophorum saccharoides</h1>
<p>Pappophorum saccharoides, commonly known as sugargrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bend and root at the nodes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in silky, hair-like structures called pappi. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along creek banks.</p>
<p>Due to its high sugar content, it has been historically used for forage and honey production.</p>
