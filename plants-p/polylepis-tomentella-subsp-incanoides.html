<p>Polylepis tomentella subsp.</p>
<p>incanoides, commonly known as the Andean cloud forest polylepis, is a shrub or small tree native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and grayish-white bark, which provide insulation against the cold and variable climate of its habitat.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cloud forest ecosystems at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining local biodiversity. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters, and it relies on insect pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, this subspecies is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
