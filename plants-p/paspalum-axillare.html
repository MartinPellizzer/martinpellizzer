<p>Paspalum axillare, commonly known as the slender paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Paspalum axillare is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and periodic flooding.</p>
