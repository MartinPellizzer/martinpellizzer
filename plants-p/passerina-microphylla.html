                    <h1>Passerina microphylla</h1>
<p>Passerina microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved pasqueflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, woolly foliage and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils. Its leaves are small, linear, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Passerina microphylla is an important component of alpine ecosystems and is often found in meadows and open slopes at high elevations.</p>
