                    <h1>Polygonum × metschii</h1>
<p>Polygonum × metschii, commonly known as the hybrid knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish to reddish flowers that appear in late summer. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with prominent veins and a smooth, slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth and ability to hybridize with other Polygonum species, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
