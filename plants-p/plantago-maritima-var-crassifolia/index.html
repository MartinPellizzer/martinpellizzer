                            <h1>Plantago Maritima Var. Crassifolia</h1>
<p>Sea plantain, scientifically known as Plantago maritima var. crassifolia, is a hardy coastal plant that thrives in saline and sandy environments. It is commonly found along shorelines, dunes, and rocky coastlines where it withstands harsh weather conditions. This variant of the common plantain has broader leaves and a more robust growth form compared to its inland relatives. Its ability to retain moisture in dry conditions makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems. Despite its tough appearance, it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
