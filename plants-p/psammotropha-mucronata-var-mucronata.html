<p>Psammotropha mucronata var. mucronata, commonly known as the sand spiker, is a flowering plant native to sandy coastal areas of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is often found in dune environments and plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes through its extensive root system.</p>
