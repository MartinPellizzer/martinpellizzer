<p>Panicum bermudianum, commonly known as Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of Bermuda and the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense growth habit, which allows it to form a thick, sod-forming turf. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it a common choice for lawns and pastures.</p>
<p>Its reproductive strategy involves both vegetative spread and seed production, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
