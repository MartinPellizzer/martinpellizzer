<p>Platanthera mandarinorum subsp.</p>
<p>ophrydioides, commonly known as the Mandarin orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to southern China. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It requires high humidity and bright, indirect light to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
