<p>Pinguicula vulgaris var. leptoceras, commonly known as the narrow-leaf butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or wetlands. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a spurred shape that aids in pollination.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
