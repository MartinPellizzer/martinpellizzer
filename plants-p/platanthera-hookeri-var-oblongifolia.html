<p>Platanthera hookeri var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a loose raceme, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
