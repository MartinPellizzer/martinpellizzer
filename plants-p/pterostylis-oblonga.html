<p>Pterostylis oblonga, commonly known as the oblong spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a slender, hairy stem with a single, narrow leaf and a spike of greenish-yellow flowers. Its flowers are characterized by their elongated, spider-like appearance, which is a common trait among the Pterostylis genus.</p>
<p>The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological dependence on fungal symbiosis.</p>
