<p>Prunus avium var. caproniana, commonly known as the Capronian cherry, is a lesser-known variant of the sweet cherry.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dark red fruits that are typically smaller than the standard Prunus avium. The plant has a compact growth habit with dense foliage and thorny branches. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes rather than commercial fruit production.</p>
