<p>Ptilopteris maximowiczii, commonly known as the giant cliff brake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize rocky or sandy soils. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of fern reproductive structures.</p>
<p>Ptilopteris maximowiczii is native to parts of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
