<p>Pteris tripartita var. magna, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a variant of the common water fern characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>It is a member of the fern family, specifically the Pteridaceae, and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, elegant appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant.
