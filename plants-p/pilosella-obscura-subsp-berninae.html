<p>Pilosella obscura subsp.</p>
<p>berninae, commonly known as the Bernina Wallflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the European Alps. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The subspecies is adapted to harsh, rocky environments, with a compact growth habit that helps it withstand strong winds and cold temperatures. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in meadows and slopes at elevations above 2,000 meters.</p>
