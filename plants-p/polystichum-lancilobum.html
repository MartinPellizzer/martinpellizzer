                    <h1>Polystichum lancilobum</h1>
<p>Polystichum lancilobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with narrow, elongated lobes that give the plant its common name. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are thick and fleshy, which help it store moisture and nutrients in its natural habitat.</p>
