<p>Phlegmariurus saururus, commonly known as the brittle bladderwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant's leaves are usually small, scale-like, and arranged in a dense, cushion-like structure. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the leaf surfaces.</p>
<p>Phlegmariurus saururus is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor conditions, often forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake.</p>
