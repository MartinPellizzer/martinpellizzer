                    <h1>Pitcairnia killipiana var. viridis</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia killipiana var. viridis, commonly known as the emerald pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense rosette of long, narrow, dark green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, adding a dramatic visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
