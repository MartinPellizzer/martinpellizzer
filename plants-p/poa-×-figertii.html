                    <h1>Poa × figertii</h1>
<p>Poa × figertii, commonly known as the hybrid bluegrass, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Poa annua and Poa pratensis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and a tufted growth habit, typical of many bluegrass species. This plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions. Due to its sterility, it does not produce seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, attractive lawns.</p>
