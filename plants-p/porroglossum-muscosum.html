                    <h1>Porroglossum muscosum</h1>
<p>Porroglossum muscosum, commonly known as the sticky leaf plant, is a species of flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is notable for its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>The sticky leaves and unique morphology make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
