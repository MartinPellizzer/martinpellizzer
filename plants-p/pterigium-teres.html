                    <h1>Pterigium teres</h1>
<p>Pterigium teres, commonly known as the teres wing bone, is not a plant but a anatomical structure in the human body.</p>
<p>It is a bony projection found in the skull, specifically in the temporal bone. This structure serves as an attachment point for muscles and ligaments involved in head movement. While it is not botanically relevant, it is often confused with plant names in medical contexts.</p>
<p>If you were referring to a plant, please provide the correct scientific name.</p>
