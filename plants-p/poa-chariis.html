<p>Poa chariis, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green blades that are often covered in a dense layer of short hairs. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike that bears small, two-lobed spikelets.</p>
