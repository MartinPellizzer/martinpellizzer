<p>Psilanthus trinervia, commonly known as the Chinese sandalwood or small-leaf sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to southern China, Vietnam, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three small, elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as critically endangered in its natural range.</p>
