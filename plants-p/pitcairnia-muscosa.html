                    <h1>Pitcairnia muscosa</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia muscosa, commonly known as the velvet pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety rosette of dark green, overlapping leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing showy, violet-blue bracts that enclose small, white flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
