<p>Pedicularis euphrasioides, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble those of the orchid family. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its specialized root system. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and cool climates.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in its native habitat.</p>
