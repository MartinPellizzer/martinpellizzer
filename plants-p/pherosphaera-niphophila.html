                    <h1>Pherosphaera niphophila</h1>
<p>Pherosphaera niphophila, commonly known as the snowflake plant, is a unique succulent native to the cold, arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, snowy environments. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the snow has fully melted. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in a fine, white coating that helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to extreme cold and can survive temperatures as low as -40Â°C.</p>
