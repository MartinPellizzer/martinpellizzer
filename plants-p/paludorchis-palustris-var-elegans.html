<p>Paludorchis palustris var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and swampy areas. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the waterlogged environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
