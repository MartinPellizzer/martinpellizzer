                    <h1>Polyspora lessertii</h1>
<p>Polyspora lessertii, commonly known as the lesser polypore, is a small, bracket-shaped fungus that grows on dead wood in temperate forests.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polyporaceae and is characterized by its tough, leathery cap and narrow, parallel-grooved pores. The fruiting bodies are typically pale yellow to brown in color and can be found on both living and dead trees, though they are more commonly associated with decaying wood. This species is saprobic, playing a role in the decomposition of organic matter in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is often used in mycological studies to understand fungal ecology and wood decomposition processes.</p>
