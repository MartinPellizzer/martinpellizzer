<p>Polystichum rupicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Polystichum rupicola is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
