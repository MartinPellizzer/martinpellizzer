                    <h1>Phloga polystachya</h1>
<p>Phloga polystachya, commonly known as the golden club, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, broad leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flower clusters in late spring, which are arranged in a panicle-like structure. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist environments.</p>
<p>Phloga polystachya is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds where the soil remains consistently saturated.</p>
