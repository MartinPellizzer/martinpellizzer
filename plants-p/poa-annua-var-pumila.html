                    <h1>Poa annua var. pumila</h1>
<p>Poa annua var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf annual bluegrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-green leaves and small, inconspicuous blue-green flowers. This variety is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils due to its rapid growth and adaptability. Its short stature and dense growth habit make it a common weed in turfgrass settings.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is distinguished by its compact inflorescence and the presence of short, rhizomatous stems.</p>
