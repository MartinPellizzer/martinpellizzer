<p>Phragmipedium humboldtii subsp.</p>
<p>exstaminodium, commonly known as the Humboldt's phragmipedium, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a unique coloration pattern, featuring a deep red lip and yellow sepals.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
