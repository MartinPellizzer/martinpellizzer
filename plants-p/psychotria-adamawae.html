                    <h1>Psychotria adamawae</h1>
<p>Psychotria adamawae, commonly known as the "angel's trumpet" or "devil's weed," is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Nigeria.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that contain the toxic alkaloid hyoscyamine. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its psychoactive properties, it has been used in traditional medicine and spiritual practices, though it is highly toxic if ingested.</p>
