                    <h1>Pterocephalus</h1>
<p>Pterocephalus, commonly known as the "goat's beard," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their distinctive, feathery inflorescences that resemble the beard of a goat, hence their common name. They are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Pterocephalus species are perennial herbs that produce small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine due to their potential pharmacological properties.</p>
