                    <h1>Podospermum salinum</h1>
<p>Podospermum salinum, commonly known as saltbush or coastal saltbush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Podospermum salinum thrives in saline and arid environments, making it well adapted to coastal and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salt levels and drought conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
