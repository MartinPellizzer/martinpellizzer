                    <h1>Poa × ivlievae</h1>
<p>Poa × ivlievae, commonly known as the hybrid bluegrass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Poa annua and Poa trivialis.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass characterized by its fine, dark green blades and dense, sod-forming growth habit. The plant typically thrives in temperate climates and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils. Its botanical features include narrow leaves with a bluish-green hue and small, spikelet-based inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
