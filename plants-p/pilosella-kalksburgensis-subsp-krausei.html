<p>Pilosella kalksburgensis subsp.</p>
<p>krausei, commonly known as the Kalksburg pilosella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf structure and flower arrangement.</p>
<p>It is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity.</p>
