<p>Pedicularis thamnophila subsp.</p>
<p>cupuliformis, commonly known as the cup-shaped lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic nature and lack of chlorophyll.</p>

<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
