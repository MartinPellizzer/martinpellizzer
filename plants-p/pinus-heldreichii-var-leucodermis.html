                    <h1>Pinus heldreichii var. leucodermis</h1>
<p>Pinus heldreichii var. leucodermis, commonly known as the white-barked pine, is a rare and endangered variant of the Heldreich's pine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive white bark, which becomes more pronounced with age, and its needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Balkan Peninsula, it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils. The plant produces cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
