                    <h1>Pappobolus decumbens</h1>
<p>Pappobolus decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate grass or creeping grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with thin, wiry stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to spread vegetatively, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
