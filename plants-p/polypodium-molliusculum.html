<p>Polypodium molliusculum, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops, in woodlands, and along stream banks, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium molliusculum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize difficult habitats.</p>
