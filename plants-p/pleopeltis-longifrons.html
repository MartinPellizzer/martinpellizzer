<p>Pleopeltis longifrons, commonly known as the long-fronded rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow, and often drooping fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in spherical, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
