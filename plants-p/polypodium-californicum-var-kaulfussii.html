<p>Polypodium californicum var. kaulfussii, commonly known as the Kaulfuss's holly fern, is a variant of the California holly fern.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive holly-like appearance, which gives it its common name. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>This variety is native to the western United States, particularly in California and parts of Oregon.</p>
