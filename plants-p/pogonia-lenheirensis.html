                    <h1>Pogonia lenheirensis</h1>
<p>Pogonia lenheirensis, commonly known as the Lenheir Ghost Orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that often resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Pogonia lenheirensis is considered critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
