                    <h1>Plesioneuron savaiense</h1>
<p>Plesioneuron savaiense, commonly known as the Savaiʻi cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the island of Savaiʻi in Samoa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
