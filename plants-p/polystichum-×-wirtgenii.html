                    <h1>Polystichum × wirtgenii</h1>
<p>Polystichum × wirtgenii, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Polystichum setiferum and Polystichum acutiforme.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often curled and tightly packed, forming a dense, ornamental clump. The plant is evergreen and thrives in shady, moist environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its fronds are typically shorter and more compact compared to its parent species, and it rarely produces spores due to its sterility.</p>
<p>Polystichum × wirtgenii is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ease of cultivation in shaded garden settings.</p>
