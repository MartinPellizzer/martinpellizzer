                    <h1>Paepalanthus elongatus var. minor</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus elongatus var. minor, commonly known as the slender pincushion cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the dry season, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished from the typical species by its smaller size and more compact growth habit.</p>
