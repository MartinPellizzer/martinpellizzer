                    <h1>Platanthera contigua</h1>
<p>Platanthera contigua, commonly known as the small-flowered twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it a mycoheterotroph.</p>
<p>This species is often found in the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
