                    <h1>Potamogeton alpinus var. subellipticus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton alpinus var. subellipticus, commonly known as the alpine pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to cold, freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich lakes and ponds, particularly in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant has long, narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often curved and have a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowers are small and arranged in spike-like clusters, and it produces small, floating fruits that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to low temperatures and can tolerate fluctuating water levels, making it a resilient species in its habitat.</p>
