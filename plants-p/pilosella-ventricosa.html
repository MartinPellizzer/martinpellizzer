                    <h1>Pilosella ventricosa</h1>
<p>Pilosella ventricosa, commonly known as the hairy rock lettuce, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a single terminal head, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often glandular and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Pilosella ventricosa is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions.</p>
