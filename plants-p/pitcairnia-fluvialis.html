                    <h1>Pitcairnia fluvialis</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia fluvialis, commonly known as the river pitcairnia, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding tank, a feature common among bromeliads. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
