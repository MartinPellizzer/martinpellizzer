                    <h1>Polyplethia</h1>
<p>Polyplethia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are shrubs or small trees characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The wood of Polyplethia species is valued for its rich reddish color and fine grain, though it is not as highly prized as true sandalwood.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, many species within this genus are now threatened with extinction.</p>
