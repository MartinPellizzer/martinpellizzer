                    <h1>Populus carolinensis</h1>
<p>Populus carolinensis, commonly known as the Carolina poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 5-9 inches long and have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins during the spring, followed by samaras that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streambanks.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age.</p>
