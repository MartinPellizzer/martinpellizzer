                    <h1>Polypodium pedatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium pedatum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and establish itself in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many fern species.</p>
