<p>Populus tremula subsp.</p>
<p>tremuloides, commonly known as the quaking aspen, is a deciduous tree native to the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its trembling leaves, which flutter in the wind due to the flattened petioles.</p>
<p>This subspecies typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas across North America. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it plays an important role in ecological succession and wildlife habitats.</p>
