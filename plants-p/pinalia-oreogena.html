                    <h1>Pinalia oreogena</h1>
<p>Pinalia oreogena, commonly known as the mountain pinyon, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific high-altitude regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, needle-like leaves adapted to harsh, cold environments. The plant produces cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Pinalia oreogena thrives in well-drained soils and has a slow growth rate, making it particularly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research.</p>
