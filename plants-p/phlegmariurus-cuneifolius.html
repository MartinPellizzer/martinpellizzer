                    <h1>Phlegmariurus cuneifolius</h1>
<p>Phlegmariurus cuneifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on moist, shaded forest floors. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in strobila, or cone-like clusters. It thrives in humid environments and is commonly found in temperate regions with high rainfall.</p>
<p>Phlegmariurus cuneifolius plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates.</p>
