                            <h1>Potentilla Millefolia Subsp. Hickmanii</h1>
<p>Potentilla millefolia subsp. hickmanii is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of the western United States. It is known for its finely divided leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. This subspecies thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
