<p>Phenax rugosus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser roughleaf fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rugged, serrated fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
