<p>Polypodium christii, commonly known as the Mexican holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Polypodium christii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
