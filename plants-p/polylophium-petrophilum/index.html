                            <h1>Polylophium Petrophilum</h1>
<p>Rocky mountain spurge, scientifically known as Polylophium petrophilum, is a hardy perennial plant native to the arid and rocky regions of the western United States. It thrives in harsh environments, often growing on steep slopes and dry, gravelly soils where few other plants can survive. With its striking yellow flowers and succulent leaves, it adds a unique touch of color to the rugged landscape. This plant is adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient symbol of the mountainous terrain it calls home. Its presence highlights the biodiversity of high-altitude ecosystems and the adaptability of plant life in challenging climates.</p>
