                    <h1>Poa alpina var. rupicaprina</h1>
<p>Poa alpina var. rupicaprina, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh alpine environments. This variety is adapted to cold climates and well-drained soils, often found in rocky or gravelly substrates. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, providing erosion control and habitat for alpine flora and fauna.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens with specific climate requirements.</p>
