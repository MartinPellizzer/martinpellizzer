<p>Polystichum lonchitis f. marginale, commonly known as the marginated wood fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds with a pale, often white or cream-colored margin.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to regions of Asia, including China and Japan. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a slender, upright habit.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'marginale' is distinguished by its prominent, contrasting edge, which sets it apart from the typical form of Polystichum lonchitis.</p>
