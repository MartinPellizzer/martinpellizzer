                    <h1>Pleopeltis × simiana</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis × simiana, commonly known as the hybrid rock fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Pleopeltis scaberula and Pleopeltis lepidophylla.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features lanceolate, leathery leaves with a distinctive veining pattern, and its fronds are usually arranged in a compact, upright manner. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
