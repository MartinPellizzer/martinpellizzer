                    <h1>Poa nemoralis var. scheuchzeri</h1>
<p>Poa nemoralis var. scheuchzeri, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a rare and low-growing grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. This variety is adapted to cool, moist environments and thrives in shaded, high-altitude habitats. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable indicator species for alpine ecosystems.</p>
