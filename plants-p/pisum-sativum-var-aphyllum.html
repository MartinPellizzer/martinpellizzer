                    <h1>Pisum sativum var. aphyllum</h1>
<p>Pisum sativum var. aphyllum, commonly known as the leafless pea, is a variant of the common pea that lacks the typical foliage.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its reduced or absent leaves, which are often replaced by modified structures such as tendrils. It produces small, pea-like pods that contain edible seeds, similar to its leafy relatives. The absence of leaves makes it unique in the legume family, affecting its photosynthetic capacity and growth habits.</p>
<p>Despite its lack of foliage, it is cultivated for its seeds and has been studied for its genetic traits.</p>
