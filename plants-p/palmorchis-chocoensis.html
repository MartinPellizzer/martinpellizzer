<p>Palmorchis chocoensis, commonly known as the Choc√≥ orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the tropical rainforests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in the humid, shaded understory of the forest. Its botanical features include a pseudobulb structure and showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
