                    <h1>Phleum geniculatum</h1>
<p>Phleum geniculatum, commonly known as bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage crop.</p>
