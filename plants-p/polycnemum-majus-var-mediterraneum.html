                    <h1>Polycnemum majus var. mediterraneum</h1>
<p>Polycnemum majus var. mediterraneum, commonly known as the Mediterranean nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and is covered in fine stinging hairs that release irritants. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This species is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
