                    <h1>Paphiopedilum chamberlainianum var. flavum</h1>
<p>Paphiopedilum chamberlainianum var. flavum, commonly known as the golden-flowered slipper orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of northern Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like lip that is typically a vibrant yellow, which is a key feature of the slipper orchid genus. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade and requires well-draining, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
