                    <h1>Pyrus tungusiana</h1>
<p>Pyrus tungusiana, commonly known as the Tungus pear, is a deciduous tree native to the Russian Far East and parts of northeastern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces edible fruits that are similar to common pears but are often smaller and have a more delicate flavor. It is typically found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
