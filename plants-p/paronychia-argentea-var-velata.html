                    <h1>Paronychia argentea var. velata</h1>
<p>Paronychia argentea var. velata, commonly known as silverleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with densely packed, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, aiding in heat reduction. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its succulent leaves are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
