                    <h1>Pitcairnia pusilla</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia pusilla, commonly known as the miniature pitcairnia, is a compact bromeliad native to the Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens.</p>
