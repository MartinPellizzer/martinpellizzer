                    <h1>Populus × brabantica</h1>
<p>Populus × brabantica, commonly known as the Brabant poplar, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Populus nigra and Populus tremula.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, often pendulous branches. The plant is native to Europe and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found near rivers and streams. It produces small, aggregate fruits that disperse via water, contributing to its spread along riparian zones.</p>
<p>The bark is typically smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
