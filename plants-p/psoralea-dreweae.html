                    <h1>Psoralea dreweae</h1>
<p>Psoralea dreweae, commonly known as the Namib Desert shrub, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and woody stems. The plant has adapted to extreme drought conditions by developing a deep root system and reduced leaf surface area. Its small, leathery leaves help minimize water loss, making it well-suited for its harsh desert environment.</p>
<p>Psoralea dreweae plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
