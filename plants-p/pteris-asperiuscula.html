                    <h1>Pteris asperiuscula</h1>
<p>Pteris asperiuscula, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are covered in fine, rough-textured scales. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often clustered and help anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid, tropical climates.</p>
