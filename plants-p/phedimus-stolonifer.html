<p>Phedimus stolonifer, commonly known as the creeping phedimus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often edible roots. The plant is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit, with slender stolons that root at the nodes and produce new shoots. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white.</p>
<p>Phedimus stolonifer is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
