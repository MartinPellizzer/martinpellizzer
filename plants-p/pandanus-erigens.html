                    <h1>Pandanus erigens</h1>
<p>Pandanus erigens, commonly known as the upland pandanus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that develop into edible fruits, which are consumed by both humans and animals. It thrives in coastal and wetland environments, often forming dense stands in mangrove areas.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to saline and brackish conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
