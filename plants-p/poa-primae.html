                    <h1>Poa primae</h1>
<p>Poa primae, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-green leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous but adapted for efficient pollination in alpine conditions. Poa primae thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and tundra ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine flora, contributing to soil stabilization and biodiversity in these fragile habitats.</p>
