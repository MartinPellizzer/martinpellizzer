<p>Primula ioessa, commonly known as the Ioessa primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often in shaded forest understories. Its foliage consists of broad, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, Primula ioessa is considered a rare and endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
