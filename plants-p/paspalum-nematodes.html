                    <h1>Paspalum nematodes</h1>
<p>Paspalum nematodes, commonly known as grass nematodes, are microscopic roundworms that primarily infest the roots of grasses, including paspalum species.</p>
<p>These nematodes are soil-dwelling and feed on root tissues, which can lead to stunted growth, reduced root development, and overall weakened plant health. They thrive in warm, moist conditions and are often found in turfgrass and agricultural settings. Infestations can be difficult to detect without careful examination of root systems.</p>
<p>Management strategies typically involve cultural practices, such as proper irrigation and soil management, rather than chemical treatments.</p>
