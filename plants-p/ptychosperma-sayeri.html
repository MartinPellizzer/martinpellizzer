                    <h1>Ptychosperma sayeri</h1>
<p>Ptychosperma sayeri, commonly known as the Sayer's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a unique subject of study in botanical science.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
