                    <h1>Picea excelsa var. integrisquamis</h1>
<p>Picea excelsa var. integrisquamis, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cone-like clusters of white, scaly bark that provide insulation and protection for its seeds. The tree typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in subalpine or alpine zones, where it forms part of the forest ecosystem. Its needles are short and dark green, and it produces small, edible cones that are an important food source for wildlife.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its resilience to harsh climates and its ecological significance in mountainous regions.</p>
