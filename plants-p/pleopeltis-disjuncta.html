<p>Pleopeltis disjuncta, commonly known as the Disjunct Brake, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a bipinnate structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are covered in a thick, velvety layer of hair, which helps in water retention.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
