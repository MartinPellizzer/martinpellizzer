<p>Panicum barbifultum, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

The plant produces spikelets that are typically borne in loose clusters, with the lemma and palea often adorned with bristles or hairs. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs.</p>
<p>Panicum barbifultum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a common weed in agricultural fields.</p>
