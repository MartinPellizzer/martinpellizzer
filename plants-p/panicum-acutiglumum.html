<p>Panicum acutiglumum, commonly known as prostrate panicgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are typical of the grass family. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-gray sheen that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to disturbed soils and is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and along roadsides.</p>
