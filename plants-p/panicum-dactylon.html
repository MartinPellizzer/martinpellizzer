<p>Panicum dactylon, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and form dense stands.</p>
<p>Switchgrass is also valued for its potential as a bioenergy crop due to its high biomass yield.</p>
