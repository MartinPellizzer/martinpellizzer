<p>Papaver rubroaurantiacum subsp.</p>
<p>smirnovii, commonly known as the Smirnov's poppy, is a rare and striking member of the Papaveraceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange-red petals that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its flowers are showy and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
