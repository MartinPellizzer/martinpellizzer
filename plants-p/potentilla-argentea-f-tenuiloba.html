                    <h1>Potentilla argentea f. tenuiloba</h1>
<p>Potentilla argentea f. tenuiloba, commonly known as silver potentilla or silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray, hairy leaves that reflect light and reduce water loss, an adaptation to its often arid or rocky habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in open, sunny environments like meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and landscape design.</p>
