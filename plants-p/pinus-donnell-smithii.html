                    <h1>Pinus donnell-smithii</h1>
<p>Pinus donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Donnell-Smith pine, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen conifer with needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structures typical of the pine family. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and has adapted to the cold, harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Its cones are woody and release seeds in the fall, contributing to its limited reproductive success.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
