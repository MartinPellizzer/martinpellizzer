<p>Protohopea tinctoria, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and aerial roots, which help it survive in brackish water environments. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, and it produces dark, fleshy berries that contain its seeds.</p>
<p>Protohopea tinctoria plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
