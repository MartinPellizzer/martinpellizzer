<p>Perralderia garamantum, commonly known as the desert flamebush, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1â€“3 meters, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Perralderia garamantum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
