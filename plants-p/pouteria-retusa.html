                    <h1>Pouteria retusa</h1>
<p>Pouteria retusa, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically 10â€“20 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are pollinated by specific insects, followed by the development of elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds. These seeds, known as Brazil nuts, are enclosed in a hard shell and are rich in nutrients, particularly selenium.</p>
<p>The plant plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
