                    <h1>Prosopanche mazzuchii</h1>
<p>Prosopanche mazzuchii, commonly known as the Mazzini's ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a parasitic plant. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, and it blooms during the dry season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Prosopanche mazzuchii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme environments.</p>
