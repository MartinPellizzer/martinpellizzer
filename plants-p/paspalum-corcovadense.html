<p>Paspalum corcovadense, commonly known as the corcovado grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a hairy surface that aids in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Paspalum corcovadense is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for forage or erosion control.</p>
