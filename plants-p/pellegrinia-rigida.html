<p>Pellegrinia rigida, commonly known as the rigid pellegrinia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Pellegrinia rigida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
