<p>Pilocereus leucocephalus, commonly known as the white- headed night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy tissue. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and nocturnal blooming habit make it a striking addition to desert gardens.</p>
