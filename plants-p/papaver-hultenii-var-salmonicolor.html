                    <h1>Papaver hultenii var. salmonicolor</h1>
<p>Papaver hultenii var. salmonicolor, commonly known as the salmon-colored poppy, is a rare and striking variant of the Hult√©n's poppy.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and surrounding areas. The plant features delicate, papery petals that range in color from pale pink to a vibrant salmon hue, often with a contrasting dark center. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
