                    <h1>Poa pratensis var. laxa</h1>
<p>Poa pratensis var. laxa, commonly known as slender meadow grass, is a variant of the common tall fescue.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often found in moist meadows and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its slightly floppy growth habit and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is distinguished by its reduced leaf auricles and shorter, more loosely arranged spikelets compared to the typical Poa pratensis.</p>
