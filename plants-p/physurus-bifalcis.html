<p>Physurus bifalcis, commonly known as the two-lobed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowers are often found at the water's surface.</p>
<p>Physurus bifalcis is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the nutrients obtained from captured prey.</p>
