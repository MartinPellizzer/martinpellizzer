                    <h1>Physalis viscosa f. glabra</h1>
<p>Physalis viscosa f. glabra, commonly known as the hairy physalis or the common groundcherry, is a variant of the Physalis genus native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name *viscosa* meaning "sticky" or "hairy.". The plant produces clusters of bright orange, lantern-shaped fruits that are edible when fully ripe. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits.</p>
<p>The glabra form differs from the typical *viscosa* by having smoother, less hairy surfaces on its stems and leaves.</p>
