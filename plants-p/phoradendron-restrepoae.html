                    <h1>Phoradendron restrepoae</h1>
<p>Phoradendron restrepoae, commonly known as the Colombian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or pinkish flowers that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Its berries are red and serve as a food source for various bird species, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Phoradendron restrepoae is considered vulnerable, highlighting the importance of preserving its ecological niche.</p>
