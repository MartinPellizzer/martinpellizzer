<p>Poa deylii f. breazensis, commonly known as the Breazens' meadowgrass, is a rare and endemic grass species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in meadows and grasslands. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spikelet that bears small, two-lobed florets.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
