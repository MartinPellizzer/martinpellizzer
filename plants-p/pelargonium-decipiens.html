                    <h1>Pelargonium decipiens</h1>
<p>Pelargonium decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The leaves are typically rounded with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Its common name reflects the plant's ability to mimic other species, which can make it challenging to identify without close examination.</p>
