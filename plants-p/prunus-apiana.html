                    <h1>Prunus apiana</h1>
<p>Prunus apiana, commonly known as the desert almond, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, almond-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste due to the presence of amygdalin. Prunus apiana thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Its ecological significance includes providing food for wildlife and serving as a host plant for certain insect species.</p>
