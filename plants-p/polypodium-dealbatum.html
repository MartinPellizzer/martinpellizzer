                    <h1>Polypodium dealbatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium dealbatum, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that typically grow on rocky outcrops and cliffs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas near water sources. Its rhizome is creeping and produces a dense network of roots that help anchor it to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are an important feature for its reproductive cycle.</p>
