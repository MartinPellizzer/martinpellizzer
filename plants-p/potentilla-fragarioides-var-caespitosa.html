                    <h1>Potentilla fragarioides var. caespitosa</h1>
<p>Potentilla fragarioides var. caespitosa, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, silver-green leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine, rocky, or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Silverweed is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments.</p>
