                    <h1>Potentilla gaudinii proles virescens</h1>
<p>Potentilla gaudinii proles virescens, commonly known as the green-stem potentilla, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, greenish stems that remain semi-woody throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and serrated, with a slightly hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
