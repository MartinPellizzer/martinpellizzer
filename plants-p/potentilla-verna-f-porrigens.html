                    <h1>Potentilla verna f. porrigens</h1>
<p>Potentilla verna f. porrigens, commonly known as the early potentilla or spring cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May, adding a vibrant touch to woodland floors. The plant has alternate, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a common sight in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for various pollinators and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
