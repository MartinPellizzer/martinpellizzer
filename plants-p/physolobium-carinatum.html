<p>Physolobium carinatum, commonly known as the scarlet wisteria, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive ridge along the midrib, giving it the species name *carinatum*. The plant produces showy, pendulous clusters of fragrant, violet to red flowers that bloom in the spring. Its stems are woody and twining, allowing it to climb trees and structures.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
