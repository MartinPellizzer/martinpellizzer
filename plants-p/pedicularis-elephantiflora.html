<p>Pedicularis elephantiflora, commonly known as the elephant's foot orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, large, leaf-like bracts that resemble elephant ears, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
