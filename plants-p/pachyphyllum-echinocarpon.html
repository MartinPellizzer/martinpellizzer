                    <h1>Pachyphyllum echinocarpon</h1>
<p>Pachyphyllum echinocarpon, commonly known as the spiny barrel cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, spiny structure. Its spines, which are modified leaves, provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Pachyphyllum echinocarpon is well adapted to desert conditions, making it a resilient and visually distinctive plant.</p>
