<p>Pseuderanthemum repandum subsp.</p>
<p>loyaltyense, commonly known as the Loyalty Island pseuderanthemum, is a flowering plant native to the Loyalty Islands in French Polynesia. It is a small, herbaceous shrub characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with smooth margins.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its flowers are short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday, a trait common in many tropical species.</p>
<p>The subspecies is notable for its limited distribution and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological and evolutionary traits.</p>
