<p>Polypodium mollipilum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
