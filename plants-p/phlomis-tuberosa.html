<p>Phlomis tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous phlomis, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has thick, fleshy roots that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Phlomis tuberosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
