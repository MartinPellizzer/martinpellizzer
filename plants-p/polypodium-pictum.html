<p>Polypodium pictum, commonly known as the painted fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that display a striking color contrast between the green and brown segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
