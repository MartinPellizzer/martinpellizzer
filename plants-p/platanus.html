<p>These trees are characterized by their distinctive bark, which peels away to reveal a mottled, lighter-colored surface beneath. The leaves are typically broad, heart-shaped, and have a smooth or slightly serrated edge. Platanus species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in riparian habitats.</p>
<p>They produce small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds.</p>
