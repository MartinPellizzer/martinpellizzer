                    <h1>Pyrus oldhamiana</h1>
<p>Pyrus oldhamiana, commonly known as the Oldham pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and attractive, finely toothed leaves. The tree produces small, clustered white flowers in early spring, followed by small, yellowish-green fruits that ripen in late summer. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and compact size, making it a popular choice for gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is not commonly cultivated for its fruit due to its small size and less flavorful pulp.</p>
