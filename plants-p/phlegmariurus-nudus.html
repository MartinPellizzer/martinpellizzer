<p>Phlegmariurus nudus, commonly known as the naked false lichen, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. The plant has a simple, thallus-like structure with a flat, ribbon-like body that lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. Its surface is usually covered in a layer of fine, greenish or yellowish algae, which contributes to its lichen-like appearance.</p>
<p>Phlegmariurus nudus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small invertebrates.</p>
