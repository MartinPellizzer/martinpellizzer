<p>Pimpinella caespitosa, commonly known as clustered cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of its family, while its fruit is a dry, two-valved schizocarp.</p>
<p>Pimpinella caespitosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
