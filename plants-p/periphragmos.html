                    <h1>Periphragmos</h1>
<p>Periphragmos, commonly known as the rock wallaby orchid, is a rare and specialized plant native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, compact growth form and its ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers that are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its leaves are typically succulent, allowing it to store water efficiently in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Periphragmos is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
