                    <h1>Pseudocyclosorus pectinata</h1>
<p>Pseudocyclosorus pectinata, commonly known as the pectinate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and wetlands. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the surrounding water.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its dispersal in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
