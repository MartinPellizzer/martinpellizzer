                    <h1>Poa hypanica</h1>
<p>Poa hypanica, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in high-altitude environments. The plant typically grows in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Poa hypanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens.</p>
