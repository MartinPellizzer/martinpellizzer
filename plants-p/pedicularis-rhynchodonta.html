<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a parasitic plant.

It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
