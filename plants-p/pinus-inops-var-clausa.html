                    <h1>Pinus inops var. clausa</h1>
<p>Pinus inops var. clausa, commonly known as the closed-cone pinyon, is a rare and endemic species native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rounded cones that remain closed for many years, releasing seeds only under specific environmental conditions. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of other pinyon pines, and it produces edible seeds that are a food source for various wildlife. This variety is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
