<p>Purdiaea nipensis var. alainii, commonly known as the Alain's rockcress, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
