                    <h1>Polypodium pycnocarpum var. buchtienii</h1>
<p>Polypodium pycnocarpum var. buchtienii, commonly known as the Buchtien's cliff fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and covered in a fine layer of trichomes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in crevices of cliffs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in the Polypodium genus.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
