                    <h1>Polypogon tarapacanus</h1>
<p>Polypogon tarapacanus, commonly known as the Atacama grass, is a perennial grass species native to the hyperarid regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It is adapted to extreme aridity, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deep underground. The plant produces slender, wiry stems and small, narrow leaves that minimize water loss. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
