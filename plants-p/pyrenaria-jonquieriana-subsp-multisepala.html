<p>Pyrenaria jonquieriana subsp.</p>
<p>multisepala, commonly known as the multiseptate pyrenaria, is a rare and specialized member of the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, particularly the multiple sepals that give it its subspecific name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in montane regions, often in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and arranged in a compact, shrub-like form.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant but poorly understood species.</p>
