<p>Platystele microtatantha, commonly known as the miniature tapanuli orchid, is a rare and endangered species of epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant has a short, compact stem with few leaves and produces a single spike of flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive, making it highly sensitive to habitat disruption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and threats from deforestation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
