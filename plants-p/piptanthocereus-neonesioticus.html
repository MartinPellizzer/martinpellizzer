<p>Piptanthocereus neonesioticus, commonly known as the Mexican night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, typical of cacti adapted to desert environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in sandy soils.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in supporting desert wildlife.</p>
