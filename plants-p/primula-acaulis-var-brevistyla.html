                    <h1>Primula acaulis var. brevistyla</h1>
<p>Primula acaulis var. brevistyla, commonly known as the cushion primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact rosette of basal leaves that form a cushion-like structure, which helps it withstand harsh mountain conditions. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is prized in rock gardens and alpine habitats for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
