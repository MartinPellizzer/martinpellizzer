                    <h1>Pediocactus simpsonii f. acklinii</h1>
<p>Pediocactus simpsonii f. acklinii, commonly known as the Acklin's cactus, is a rare and compact columnar cactus native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with a smooth, pale green to bluish-green surface that becomes more spiny with age. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise subdued appearance. It is highly adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
