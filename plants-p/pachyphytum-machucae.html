<p>Pachyphytum machucae, commonly known as the Machuca stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Andes Mountains of Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, a typical adaptation to its arid and high-altitude environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the growing season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and resilience make it a valuable addition to both horticultural collections and natural ecosystems.</p>
