                    <h1>Pedicularis anas var. xanthantha</h1>
<p>Pedicularis anas var. xanthantha, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
