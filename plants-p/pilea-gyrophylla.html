                    <h1>Pilea gyrophylla</h1>
<p>Pilea gyrophylla, commonly known as the water shield, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, and is characterized by its floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its roots form dense mats on the water surface, helping to stabilize the ecosystem and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Pilea gyrophylla is also valued for its ability to filter water and improve water quality in its native habitats.</p>
