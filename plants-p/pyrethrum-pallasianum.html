                    <h1>Pyrethrum pallasianum</h1>
<p>Pyrethrum pallasianum, commonly known as the Pallas's pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called phytolacca, which are responsible for its insecticidal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its natural pest-repelling qualities, it has been historically used in organic pest control.</p>
