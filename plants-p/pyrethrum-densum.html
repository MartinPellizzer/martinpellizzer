                    <h1>Pyrethrum densum</h1>
<p>Pyrethrum densum, commonly known as the dense pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellowish to orange flowers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes on its leaves and stems, which contribute to its insect-repelling properties. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Pyrethrum densum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and as a source of natural insecticides.</p>
