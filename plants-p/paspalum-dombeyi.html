<p>Paspalum dombeyi, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is highly tolerant of salt spray and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments.</p>
<p>Paspalum dombeyi is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
