                    <h1>Polycarpon rotundifolium</h1>
<p>Polycarpon rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leafed sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, fleshy, rounded leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. Its root system is extensive and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Polycarpon rotundifolium is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along roadsides, disturbed areas, and in desert margins.</p>
