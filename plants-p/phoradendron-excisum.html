                    <h1>Phoradendron excisum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron excisum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees, such as oaks and hickories.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted for this parasitic lifestyle. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Phoradendron excisum plays a unique ecological role in forest ecosystems, influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
