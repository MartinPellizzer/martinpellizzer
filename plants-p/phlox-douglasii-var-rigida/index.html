                            <h1>Phlox Douglasii Var. Rigida</h1>
<p>Phlox douglasii var. rigida is a striking native wildflower found in the western United States. It is known for its vibrant pink to purple blooms that appear in late spring. This plant thrives in rocky soils and open habitats, often growing along stream banks and slopes. Its rigid stems and showy flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking native plants. Despite its beauty, it requires specific conditions to flourish and is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas.</p>
