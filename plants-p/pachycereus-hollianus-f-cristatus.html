                    <h1>Pachycereus hollianus f. cristatus</h1>
<p>Pachycereus hollianus f. cristatus, commonly known as the Cristate Holly Cactus, is a unique variant of the Holly Cactus characterized by its distinctive crown-like growth pattern.</p>
<p>This plant is native to Mexico and is part of the Cactaceae family, known for its succulent stems that store water. The f. cristatus form exhibits a flattened, fan-shaped structure due to a genetic mutation called "cristation," which causes the stems to grow outward in a rosette pattern. It produces white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding ornamental value to its appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is a popular choice for collectors and cactus enthusiasts.</p>
