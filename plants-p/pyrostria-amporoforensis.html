                    <h1>Pyrostria amporoforensis</h1>
<p>Pyrostria amporoforensis, commonly known as the Madagascar star fern, is a unique member of the Blechnaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. Native to Madagascar, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across forest floors.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
