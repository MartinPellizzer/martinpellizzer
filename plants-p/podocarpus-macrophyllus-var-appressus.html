                    <h1>Podocarpus macrophyllus var. appressus</h1>
<p>Podocarpus macrophyllus var. appressus, commonly known as the Chinese podocarp or Japanese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are tightly appressed to the stems. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a hedging plant.</p>
<p>This variant is also valued for its aromatic wood, which has been used historically in construction and furniture-making.</p>
