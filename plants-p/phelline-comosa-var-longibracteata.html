<p>Phelline comosa var. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract phelline, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and grayish-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often surrounded by long, bract-like structures. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to harsh, semi-desert conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
