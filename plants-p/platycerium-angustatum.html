                    <h1>Platycerium angustatum</h1>
<p>Platycerium angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds that grow directly from the base of the plant, forming a rosette structure. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain through its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening.</p>
