                    <h1>Potentilla varia var. villosa</h1>
<p>Potentilla varia var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its silver-gray foliage and dense, hairy covering on its stems and leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates.</p>
