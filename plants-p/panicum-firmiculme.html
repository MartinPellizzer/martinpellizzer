<p>Panicum firmiculme, commonly known as the stiff panicgrass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow,坚韧 (stiff) leaf blades, which give it its common name. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
