                    <h1>Phaeiris</h1>
<p>Phaeiris, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, silver-gray leaves that reflect light and reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid environments. The flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of pink or white, and are pollinated by insects. Phaeiris species are native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas, where they thrive in dry, sunny conditions.</p>
<p>These plants are sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their striking foliage.</p>
