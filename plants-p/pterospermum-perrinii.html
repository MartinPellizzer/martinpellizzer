                    <h1>Pterospermum perrinii</h1>
<p>Pterospermum perrinii, commonly known as the Malabar pterospermum, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical capsules containing numerous seeds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its dense foliage and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>However, it is relatively uncommon in cultivation due to its specific habitat requirements.</p>
