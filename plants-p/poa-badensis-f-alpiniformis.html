                    <h1>Poa badensis f. alpiniformis</h1>
<p>Poa badensis f. alpiniformis, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude habitats.</p>
