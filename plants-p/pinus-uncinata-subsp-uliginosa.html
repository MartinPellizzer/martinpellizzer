<p>Pinus uncinata subsp.</p>
<p>uliginosa, commonly known as the bog pine, is a subspecies of the stone pine native to wet, acidic environments in Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>The needles are typically shorter and more densely packed compared to other pine species, and the cones are small and woody. This subspecies plays a significant role in stabilizing peat bogs and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a valuable component of ancient forest ecosystems.</p>
