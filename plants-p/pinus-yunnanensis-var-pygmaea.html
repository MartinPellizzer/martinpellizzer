<p>Pinus yunnanensis var. pygmaea, commonly known as the Yunnan dwarf pine, is a compact variant of the Yunnan pine native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small stature, typically reaching only a few meters in height, making it well-suited for rocky or alpine environments. The tree has needle-like leaves that are short and often clustered at the base of the shoots. Its cones are small and woody, containing edible seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variety exhibits adaptations to high-altitude conditions, including slow growth and frost resistance.</p>
