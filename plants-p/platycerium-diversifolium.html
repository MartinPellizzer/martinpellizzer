                    <h1>Platycerium diversifolium</h1>
<p>Platycerium diversifolium, commonly known as the stag's horn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds that resemble the horns of a stag, giving it its common name. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its fronds from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks.</p>
<p>Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and horticultural displays.</p>
