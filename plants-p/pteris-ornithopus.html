                    <h1>Pteris ornithopus</h1>
<p>Pteris ornithopus, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, loosely clustered fronds that resemble a bird's nest, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome that produces upright, lance-shaped fronds with a waxy surface. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Pteris ornithopus is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
