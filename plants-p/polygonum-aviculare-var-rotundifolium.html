                    <h1>Polygonum aviculare var. rotundifolium</h1>
<p>Polygonum aviculare var. rotundifolium, commonly known as roundleaf knotweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that features small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland environments.</p>
