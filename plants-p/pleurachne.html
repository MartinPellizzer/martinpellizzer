                    <h1>Pleurachne</h1>
<p>Pleurachne, commonly known as the grass genus, is a group of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their slender, often tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. They are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Pleurachne species are often used in ecological restoration due to their resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Their small, spike-like inflorescences produce tiny grains that are dispersed by wind, aiding in their propagation.</p>
