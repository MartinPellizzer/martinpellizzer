                    <h1>Potentilla gracilis var. permollis</h1>
<p>Potentilla gracilis var. permollis, commonly known as the silky cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, dense hairs, giving it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
