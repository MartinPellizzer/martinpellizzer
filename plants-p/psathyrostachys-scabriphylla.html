                    <h1>Psathyrostachys scabriphylla</h1>
<p>Psathyrostachys scabriphylla, commonly known as the roughleaf goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas but also holds ecological significance in its native range.</p>
