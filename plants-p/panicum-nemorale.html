                    <h1>Panicum nemorale</h1>
<p>Panicum nemorale, commonly known as woodland dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist to wet soils in shaded to partially shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along streambanks. The plant produces slender, grass-like leaves and small, fluffy seed heads that mature in late summer. Its compact growth habit and ability to form dense clumps make it a valuable native plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat.</p>
<p>Panicum nemorale is also appreciated for its ornamental value in gardens and natural landscapes.</p>
