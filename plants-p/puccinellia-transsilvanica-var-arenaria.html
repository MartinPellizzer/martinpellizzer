                    <h1>Puccinellia transsilvanica var. arenaria</h1>
<p>Puccinellia transsilvanica var. arenaria, commonly known as sand couchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to sandy and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in dunes, coastal areas, and dry meadows.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
