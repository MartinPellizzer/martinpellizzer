                    <h1>Pleconax coniflora</h1>
<p>Pleconax coniflora, commonly known as the pinecone flower, is a unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, cone-like inflorescences that resemble pinecones, which are actually clusters of small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist climates. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and they bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Pleconax coniflora is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
