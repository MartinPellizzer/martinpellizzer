                    <h1>Pilea macrocystolithica</h1>
<p>Pilea macrocystolithica, commonly known as the giant stone plant, is a unique member of the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. Its most distinctive feature is the presence of large, calcified structures called liths, which are embedded in the stems.</p>
<p>These liths are believed to be a form of calcium carbonate storage, aiding in the plant's survival in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
