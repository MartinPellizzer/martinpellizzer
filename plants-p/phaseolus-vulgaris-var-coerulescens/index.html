                            <h1>Phaseolus Vulgaris Var. Coerulescens</h1>
<p>Blue bean, scientifically known as Phaseolus vulgaris var. coerulescens, is a unique variety of common bean that stands out for its striking blue flowers and edible pods. Native to the Americas, this plant has been cultivated for centuries by indigenous communities for both its ornamental and nutritional value. Its vibrant blue hue is due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments, which also offer antioxidant benefits. While primarily grown as a decorative plant, some varieties are edible and can be harvested for consumption. This versatile plant showcases the beauty and utility of legumes in both gardens and kitchens.</p>
