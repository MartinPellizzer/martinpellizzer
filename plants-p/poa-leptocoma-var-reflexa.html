                    <h1>Poa leptocoma var. reflexa</h1>
<p>Poa leptocoma var. reflexa, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features slender, often curved blades with a distinctive reflexed (bent backward) appearance at the base, which is a key identifying trait. The plant typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, lawns, and disturbed areas. Its small, spike-like inflorescences contain numerous tiny flowers, and it is adapted to thrive in cool, humid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its fine texture and ability to form a dense turf, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping.</p>
