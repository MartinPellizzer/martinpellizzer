<p>Polypodium semicordatum, commonly known as the stag's horn fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, curved fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid environments. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue-green glow at night.</p>
<p>This unique trait makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study and a popular ornamental plant.</p>
