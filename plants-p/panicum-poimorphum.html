<p>Panicum poimorphum, commonly known as the variable panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the warm temperate and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to a range of environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated for agricultural purposes, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
