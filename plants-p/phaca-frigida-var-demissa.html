<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with dense, mat-forming foliage that thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species.</p>
