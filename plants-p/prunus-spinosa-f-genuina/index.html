                            <h1>Prunus Spinosa F. Genuina</h1>
<p>European blackthorn, scientifically known as Prunus spinosa f. genuina, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is recognized for its dark, thorny branches and small, glossy leaves that provide a striking visual contrast. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in spring, which give way to black, tart berries in late summer. Despite its rugged appearance, it plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and has a long history of use in traditional medicine. Its resilience and adaptability make it a common sight in hedgerows and woodland edges across its native range.</p>
