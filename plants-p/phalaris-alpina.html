<p>Phalaris alpina, commonly known as alpine grass or mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows and tundra environments. The plant has slender,丛生的 stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are usually greenish or reddish, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Phalaris alpina is adapted to cold climates and can survive harsh winter conditions due to its low-growing habit and dense root system.</p>
