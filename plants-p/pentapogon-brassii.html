<p>Pentapogon brassii, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps to reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Pentapogon brassii is an important plant for pollinators and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens.</p>
