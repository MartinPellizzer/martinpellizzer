                    <h1>Platanthera mandarinorum f. monophylla</h1>
<p>Platanthera mandarinorum f. monophylla, commonly known as the Mandarin orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive greenish-blue hue, which are often fragrant. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
