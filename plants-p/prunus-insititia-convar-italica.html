<p>Prunus insititia convar. italica, commonly known as the Italian blackthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces fragrant white flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows or woodland edges.</p>
<p>The berries are used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye, though they are generally toxic when raw.</p>
