                    <h1>Polygonum hirsutum var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Polygonum hirsutum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and other wetland habitats. Its stems are usually smooth and slender, and it produces small, bead-like seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variety is less hairy than the typical Polygonum hirsutum, giving it its name "glabrescens," meaning becoming smooth or hairless.</p>
