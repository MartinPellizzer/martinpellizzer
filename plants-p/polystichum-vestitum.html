<p>Polystichum vestitum, commonly known as the dressed fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor into the soil, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polystichum vestitum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, persistent foliage.</p>
