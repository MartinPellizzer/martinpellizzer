                    <h1>Pleopeltis capitellata</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis capitellata, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense rosettes of lanceolate, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white trichomes. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are typically found in shaded, humid environments. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself to tree trunks or rocky surfaces.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
