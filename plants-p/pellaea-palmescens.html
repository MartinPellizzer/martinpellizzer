<p>Pellaea palmescens, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Pellaea palmescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
