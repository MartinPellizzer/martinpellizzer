                    <h1>Prosaptia shawii</h1>
<p>Prosaptia shawii, commonly known as the Shaw's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity and moderate temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Prosaptia shawii is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
