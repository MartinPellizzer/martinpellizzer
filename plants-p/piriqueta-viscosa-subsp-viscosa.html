<p>Piriqueta viscosa subsp.</p>
<p>viscosa, commonly known as the sticky piriqueta, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture, which helps in water retention and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in a waxy cuticle, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy addition to xeriscapes.</p>
