<p>Phragmipedium warscewiczii subsp.</p>
<p>exstaminodium, commonly known as the pink phragmipedium, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pinkish hue and a unique, elongated lip.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features include long, strap-like leaves and a complex, spurred column typical of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
