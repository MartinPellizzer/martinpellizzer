<p>Potentilla concinna f. humifusa, commonly known as the low potentilla, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
