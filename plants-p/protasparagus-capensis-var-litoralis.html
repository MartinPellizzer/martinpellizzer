                    <h1>Protasparagus capensis var. litoralis</h1>
<p>Protasparagus capensis var. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal protasparagus, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found along coastal cliffs and dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is well-suited for xeriscaping and coastal gardening.</p>
