<p>Pedicularis pumila, commonly known as the dwarf lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic nature and lack of chlorophyll. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. Its flowers are often clustered in whorls along the stem, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat and appearance, it is often found in mountainous environments where it plays a role in the local flora.</p>
