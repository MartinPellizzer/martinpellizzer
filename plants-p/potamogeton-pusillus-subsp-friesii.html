<p>Potamogeton pusillus subsp.</p>
<p>friesii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 mm wide, giving it a distinct appearance among other pondweeds.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which emerge from the water surface during the summer months. It thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality in its native environments.</p>
