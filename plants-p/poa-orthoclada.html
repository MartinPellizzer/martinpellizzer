                    <h1>Poa orthoclada</h1>
<p>Poa orthoclada, commonly known as the narrow leaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a resilient species in various habitats.</p>
<p>Poa orthoclada is often found in meadows, lawns, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
