<p>Philippia simii, commonly known as the yellow-eyed poinsettia, is a species of flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow bracts that surround small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is typically cultivated for its ornamental value, especially during the holiday season. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Philippia simii is often mistaken for the traditional poinsettia, but it differs in its coloration and growth habits.</p>
