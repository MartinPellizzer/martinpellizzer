                    <h1>Phoradendron berteroanum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron berteroanum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are often waxy and evergreen. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are a food source for birds and other animals. Its growth is slow, and it can live for decades, forming dense clusters on its host.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in ecological systems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
