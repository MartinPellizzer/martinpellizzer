                    <h1>Panicum prostratum</h1>
<p>Panicum prostratum, commonly known as prostrate panicgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, hairless stems that lie flat on the soil surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, fluffy seeds. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, along roadsides, and in sandy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in some agricultural settings but also serves as a valuable pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
