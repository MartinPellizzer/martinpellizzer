<p>Phyllanthus sandwicensis var. hypoglaucus, commonly known as the Kona phyllanthus, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, alternate leaves that are typically glabrous or nearly so. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the unique climate of Hawaii.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in native Hawaiian ecosystems.</p>
