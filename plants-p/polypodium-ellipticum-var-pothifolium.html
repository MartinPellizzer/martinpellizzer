<p>Polypodium ellipticum var. pothifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a variant of the polypodium genus native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium.
