<p>Pilosella lactucella subsp.</p>
<p>lampreilema, commonly known as the alpine hawk's-beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its finely pubescent leaves and shorter, more compact growth form compared to the typical species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in open meadows and slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many areas.</p>
