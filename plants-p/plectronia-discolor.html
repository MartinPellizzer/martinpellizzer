                    <h1>Plectronia discolor</h1>
<p>Plectronia discolor, commonly known as the purple ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that are often hidden among its dense foliage. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific environmental requirements, Plectronia discolor is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
