<p>Pteris nivea, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, light green fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in circular structures called sori. Pteris nivea thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
