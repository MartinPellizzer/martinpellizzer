<p>Peperomia sansalvadorana, commonly known as the Brazilian peperomia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it relatively drought-tolerant.</p>
