                    <h1>Pentameris obtusifolia</h1>
<p>Pentameris obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers with five petals, which are arranged in an umbel-like inflorescence. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores.</p>
<p>Pentameris obtusifolia plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies.</p>
