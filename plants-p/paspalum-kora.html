<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and salt-resistant, making it well-suited for coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize sand dunes makes it ecologically significant in coastal ecosystems.</p>
