                    <h1>Pseudotsuga menziesii f. pumila</h1>
<p>Pseudotsuga menziesii f. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf mountain hemlock, is a naturally occurring variant of the Douglas fir.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, slow-growing form and dense foliage, which gives it a distinctive, rounded appearance. This subspecies typically thrives in high-altitude environments, such as mountainous regions in the Pacific Northwest of North America. Its needles are short and dark green, and it produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to harsh conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
