                    <h1>Panax japonicus f. trifoliolatus</h1>
<p>Panax japonicus f. trifoliolatus, commonly known as the Japanese ginseng with three leaflets, is a variant of the Panax genus native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its roots, similar to other ginseng species, are valued for their medicinal properties.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
