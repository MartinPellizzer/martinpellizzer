                    <h1>Pelazoneuron berroi</h1>
<p>Pelazoneuron berroi, commonly known as the golden spire plant, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, spiraling arrangement of golden-yellow leaves that form a compact, cone-like structure. The plant possesses a fibrous root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils and extreme weather conditions. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Pelazoneuron berroi is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine.</p>
