                    <h1>Pachylarnax kachirachirai</h1>
<p>Pachylarnax kachirachirai, commonly known as the Kachirachirai fern, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which helps it thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
