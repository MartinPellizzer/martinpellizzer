<p>Potamogeton pusillus var. minor, commonly known as the small pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by tiny, boat-shaped fruits. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some water bodies if not managed properly.</p>
