<p>Pilocereus remolinensis, commonly known as the Remolin's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spineless plant with a segmented stem that is often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces showy, nocturnal flowers that are typically white or pale pink, opening in the evening and closing by dawn. These flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and reducing water loss through its hairy surface.</p>
