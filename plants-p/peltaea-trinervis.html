                    <h1>Peltaea trinervis</h1>
<p>Peltaea trinervis, commonly known as the three-veined peltate, is a member of the Rosaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub characterized by its peltate leaves, which have a broad, shield-like shape with a distinct central vein. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring or early summer. Its fruits are follicles that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, Peltaea trinervis is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
