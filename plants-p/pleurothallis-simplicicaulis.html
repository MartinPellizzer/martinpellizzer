<p>Pleurothallis simplicicaulis, commonly known as the simple-stemmed orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually ovate and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its compact appearance.</p>
<p>This orchid is often found in forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption.</p>
