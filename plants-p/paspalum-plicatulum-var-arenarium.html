<p>Paspalum plicatulum var. arenarium, commonly known as sand paspalum, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system.</p>
<p>This species is often used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
