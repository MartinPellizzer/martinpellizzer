<p>Polypodium oxypholis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or trees. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium oxypholis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
