<p>Pachyphytum compactum, commonly known as the compact pachyphytum, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming structure composed of thick, fleshy leaves that store water, a feature typical of desert plants. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal watering, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
