                    <h1>Polypodium chirripoense</h1>
<p>Polypodium chirripoense, commonly known as the Chirrip√≥ polypody, is a fern native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or tree trunks. Its spores are released from small, fleshy structures called sorangia, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium chirripoense plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of its native habitats.</p>
