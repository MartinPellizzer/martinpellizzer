                    <h1>Polypodium chionolepis</h1>
<p>Polypodium chionolepis, commonly known as the snow fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds that are often covered in a dense, whitish bloom, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is typically found growing on tree trunks or rocks in high-altitude forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>The snow fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant in cooler climates.</p>
