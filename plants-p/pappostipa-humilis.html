                    <h1>Pappostipa humilis</h1>
<p>Pappostipa humilis, commonly known as the slender grass or dwarf pappostipa, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>
