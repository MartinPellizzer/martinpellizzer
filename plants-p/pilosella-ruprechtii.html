<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in rocky and well-drained soils. Its leaves are hairy and often covered in fine white or grayish down, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
