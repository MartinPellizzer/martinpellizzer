                    <h1>Polypodium serrulatum var. wittigianum</h1>
<p>Polypodium serrulatum var. wittigianum, commonly known as the Wittig's holly fern, is a variant of the serrulate holly fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dark green, lanceolate fronds with serrated margins. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The varietal distinction is based on subtle differences in leaf morphology and geographic distribution.</p>
