                    <h1>Poa × taurica</h1>
<p>Poa × taurica, commonly known as the hybrid meadow grass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Poa annua and Poa trivialis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, green blades that often form dense mats in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed areas. Its reproductive strategy relies on vegetative propagation rather than seed production, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and horticultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, Poa × taurica is often used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
