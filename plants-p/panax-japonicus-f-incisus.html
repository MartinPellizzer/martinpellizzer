<p>Panax japonicus f. incisus, commonly known as the Japanese ginseng or Korean ginseng, is a variant of the Panax genus native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is typically found in forested regions with moist, well-drained soil. It is valued for its roots, which are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
