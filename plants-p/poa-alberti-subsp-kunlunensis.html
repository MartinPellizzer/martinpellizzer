<p>Poa alberti subsp.</p>
<p>kunlunensis, commonly known as the Kunlun grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairless leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences with small, two-ranked spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique ecological niche and potential for use in restoration projects in alpine regions.</p>
