<p>Pulicaria pomeliana, commonly known as the Mediterranean groundsel, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions contributes to its ecological importance in Mediterranean ecosystems.</p>
