<p>Peranema foeniculacea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, stream banks, and pond edges. The plant has slender, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Peranema foeniculacea plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians.</p>
