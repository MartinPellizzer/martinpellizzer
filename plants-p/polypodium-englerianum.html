<p>Polypodium englerianum, commonly known as the Engler's water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, lobed segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the ground.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
