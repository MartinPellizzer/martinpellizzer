<p>Palaua dissecta, commonly known as the dissected palaua, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. Its flowers are typically small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe.</p>
<p>Palaua dissecta is often found in wetlands and along the edges of freshwater bodies, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
