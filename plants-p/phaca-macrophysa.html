                    <h1>Phaca macrophysa</h1>
<p>Phaca macrophysa, commonly known as the giant bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, enabling it to function as a carnivorous plant. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its roots are often submerged, while its stems and leaves float on the water's surface.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters, and are pollinated by insects.</p>
