<p>Pinalia lamonganensis, commonly known as the Lamongan pinalia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Indonesian island of Java.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its herbaceous growth habit with simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the dry season. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Pinalia lamonganensis is considered vulnerable and requires further study for effective conservation strategies.</p>
