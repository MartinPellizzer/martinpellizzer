<p>Petasites nivalis subsp.</p>
<p>hyperboreus, commonly known as the Arctic buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in a rounded inflorescence. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas in its harsh habitat.</p>
