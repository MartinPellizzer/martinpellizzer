<p>Phleum pratense var. nodosum, commonly known as nodding sweetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to form dense mats, making it a common component of meadows and wetlands.</p>
<p>Nodding sweetgrass is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional crafts and medicine.</p>
