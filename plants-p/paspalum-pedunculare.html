                    <h1>Paspalum pedunculare</h1>
<p>Paspalum pedunculare, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it a common component of wetland vegetation.</p>
<p>Paspalum pedunculare is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
