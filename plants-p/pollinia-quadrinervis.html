<p>Pollinia quadrinervis, commonly known as the quadrinerved orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique pollinia, which are clustered in groups of four, a feature that distinguishes it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are usually small and have a complex structure with specialized petals and sepals.</p>
<p>The botanical study of Pollinia quadrinervis provides insights into orchid pollination mechanisms and evolutionary adaptations.</p>
