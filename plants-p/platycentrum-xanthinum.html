<p>Platycentrum xanthinum, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and bright yellow-green coloration, which is due to the presence of xanthophyll pigments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its small, scale-like leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Platycentrum xanthinum is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
