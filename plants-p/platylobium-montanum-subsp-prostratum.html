<p>Platylobium montanum subsp.</p>
<p>prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate swamp lilly, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to Western Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat, often growing in wet or swampy habitats.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils and has a rhizomatous root system for spreading.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its specialized habitat requirements and limited distribution.</p>
