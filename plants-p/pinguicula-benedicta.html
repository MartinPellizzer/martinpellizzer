<p>Pinguicula benedicta, commonly known as the Benedict's butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of glandular, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink in color. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, often found in rocky or boggy areas.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake by capturing and digesting prey.</p>
