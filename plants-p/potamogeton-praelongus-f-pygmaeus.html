                    <h1>Potamogeton praelongus f. pygmaeus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton praelongus f. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is a variant of the broader Potamogeton praelongus species, distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth form. The plant typically has slender, branching stems with small, narrow leaves that are arranged spirally along the stem. It produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in shallow, slow-moving waters such as ponds and lakes.</p>
