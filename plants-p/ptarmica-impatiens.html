                    <h1>Ptarmica impatiens</h1>
<p>Ptarmica impatiens, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America.</p>
<p>It features bright yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. It spreads rapidly through rhizomes, forming dense mats that can dominate moist, shady areas.</p>
<p>While it is an ornamental plant in gardens, it can become invasive in natural habitats if not managed carefully.</p>
