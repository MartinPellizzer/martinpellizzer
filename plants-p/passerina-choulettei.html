<p>Passerina choulettei, commonly known as the Choulette's pasqueflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of central Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, early spring blooms with bright yellow petals. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it faces harsh environmental conditions. Its small, palmately lobed leaves are adapted to minimize water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Passerina choulettei is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
