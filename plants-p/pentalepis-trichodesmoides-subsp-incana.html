<p>Pentalepis trichodesmoides subsp.</p>
<p>incana, commonly known as the silky spinifex, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and gray-green foliage with a silky texture due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems.</p>
