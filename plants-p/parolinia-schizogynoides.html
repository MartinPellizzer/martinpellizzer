                    <h1>Parolinia schizogynoides</h1>
<p>Parolinia schizogynoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, which are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, typically blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
