                    <h1>Pritchardia schattaueri</h1>
<p>Pritchardia schattaueri, commonly known as the Schattauerâ€™s cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal and lowland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
