<p>Prosopis, commonly known as the mesquite tree, is a genus of shrubs and trees native to the Americas.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their compound leaves, which are often small and feather-like, and their pods that contain edible seeds. Prosopis species are drought-tolerant and adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making them important in desert ecosystems. They play a vital role in soil stabilization and provide food for wildlife and humans.</p>
<p>The wood of some species is used for fuel and construction, while others are valued for their ornamental appeal.</p>
