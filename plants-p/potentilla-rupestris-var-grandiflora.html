                    <h1>Potentilla rupestris var. grandiflora</h1>
<p>Potentilla rupestris var. grandiflora, commonly known as the rock potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and silver-blue foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with rocky or gravelly conditions.</p>
