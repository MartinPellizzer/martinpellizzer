                    <h1>Paphiopedilum topperi</h1>
<p>Paphiopedilum topperi, commonly known as the Topper's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, a feature typical of the Paphiopedilum genus. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
