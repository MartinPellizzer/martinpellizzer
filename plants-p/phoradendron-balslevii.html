                    <h1>Phoradendron balslevii</h1>
<p>Phoradendron balslevii, commonly known as the Balslev's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Viscaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Costa Rica and Panama. This plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as those in the Moraceae and Fabaceae families, and derives some of its nutrients from the host. It produces small, white or greenish-white berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>The plant's foliage is evergreen, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its forest habitat.</p>
