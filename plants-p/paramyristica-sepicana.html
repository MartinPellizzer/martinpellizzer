<p>Paramyristica sepicana, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves with prominent red veins and its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowering period typically occurs during the wet season, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Paramyristica sepicana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
