                    <h1>Pocockia scutellata</h1>
<p>Pocockia scutellata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Pocockia scutellata is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
