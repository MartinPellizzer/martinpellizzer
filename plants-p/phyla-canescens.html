<p>Phyla canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a member of the Amaranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant.</p>
