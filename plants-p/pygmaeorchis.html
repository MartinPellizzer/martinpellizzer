                    <h1>Pygmaeorchis</h1>
<p>Pygmaeorchis, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a genus of small, terrestrial orchids native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>These plants typically grow in cool, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Their flowers are usually small and delicate, with a distinctive orchid-like structure that includes three sepals and three petals. Pygmaeorchis species are characterized by their short stature and their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to their limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, many species within this genus are considered rare or endangered.</p>
