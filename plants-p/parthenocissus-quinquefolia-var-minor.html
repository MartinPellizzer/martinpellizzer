                    <h1>Parthenocissus quinquefolia var. minor</h1>
<p>Parthenocissus quinquefolia var. minor, commonly known as the Boston ivy, is a climbing vine native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which typically have five lobes, though the varietal form minor often exhibits fewer lobes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its vigorous growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental use on walls and trellises.</p>
<p>The leaves turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn, adding seasonal color to landscapes.</p>
