                    <h1>Peperomia concava</h1>
<p>Peperomia concava, commonly known as the concave peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically oval or spatulate in shape, with a distinctive concave base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, often green or reddish in color, which are followed by tiny, round berries. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light.</p>
<p>Peperomia concava is valued for its ornamental foliage and air-purifying qualities.</p>
