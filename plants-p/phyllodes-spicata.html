<p>Phyllodes spicata, commonly known as the spicate phyllode acacia, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its unique phyllodes, which are flattened, leaf-like structures that serve as photosynthetic organs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>Its woody stems and drought-resistant nature make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
