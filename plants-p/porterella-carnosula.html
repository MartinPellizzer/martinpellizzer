<p>Porterella carnosula, commonly known as the pink-flowered rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant produces vibrant pink or purple flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. Its leaves are small and often modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Porterella carnosula thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
