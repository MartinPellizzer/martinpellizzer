                    <h1>Piptanthocereus lanosus</h1>
<p>Piptanthocereus lanosus, commonly known as the woolly night blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of white and pale yellow. These flowers are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths and bats.</p>
<p>Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
