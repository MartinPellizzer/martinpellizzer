<p>Polystichum acutum, commonly known as the acute holly fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are dark green and deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Polystichum acutum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its graceful, fern-like appearance.</p>
