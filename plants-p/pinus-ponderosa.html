                <h1>Pinus ponderosa</h1>
<p>Pinus ponderosa, commonly known as the ponderosa pine, is a tall, coniferous evergreen tree native to western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, needle-like leaves and distinctive, thick, bark that flakes off in plates. The tree produces cones that contain seeds enclosed in scales, which are dispersed by wind. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in dry, rocky soils and withstand fires.</p>
<p>The ponderosa pine plays a vital role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to biodiversity.</p>
