                    <h1>Phylloxylon arenicola</h1>
<p>Phylloxylon arenicola, commonly known as the sand phylloxylon, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize sandy soils effectively.</p>
<p>Phylloxylon arenicola plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
