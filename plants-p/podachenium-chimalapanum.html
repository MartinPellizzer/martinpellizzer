<p>Podachenium chimalapanum, commonly known as the Chimalapan fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that grow in a compact, clustered form. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance and ecological significance.</p>
