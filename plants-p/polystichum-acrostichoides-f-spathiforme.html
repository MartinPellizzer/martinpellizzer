<p>Polystichum acrostichoides f. spathiforme, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae that give the plant a dense, feathery appearance. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
