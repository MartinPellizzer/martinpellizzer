<p>Pseudopipturus repandus, commonly known as the broadleaf hakea, is a shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, pinkish-white flower clusters. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy environments, exhibiting adaptations to nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are leathery and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated by insects and produce small, hard-coated seeds.</p>
