                    <h1>Platanthera bifolia var. brachyglossa</h1>
<p>Platanthera bifolia var. brachyglossa, commonly known as the short-lipped bog orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and fens.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its ecological dependence on symbiotic relationships. It is often found in association with other rare flora in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
