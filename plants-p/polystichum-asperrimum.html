<p>Polystichum asperrimum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are densely covered with tiny, rough-surfaced scales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium.</p>
<p>Polystichum asperrimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy and attractive foliage.</p>
