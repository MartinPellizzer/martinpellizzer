                    <h1>Phragmites communis var. subuniflora</h1>
<p>Phragmites communis var. subuniflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved common reed, is a perennial grass native to wetland environments across North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tall, cylindrical inflorescences that produce a large number of small, fluffy seeds. This variety thrives in brackish and freshwater marshes, often forming dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it a dominant species in many wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological benefits, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
