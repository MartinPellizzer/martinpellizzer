                    <h1>Prunus × lannesiana f. multipetala</h1>
<p>Prunus × lannesiana f. multipetala, commonly known as the double-flowered cherry, is a botanical variant of the Prunus genus characterized by its ornamental double blossoms.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a high number of petals, often resulting in a full, fluffy appearance that distinguishes it from single-flowered varieties. It is a naturally occurring mutation within the species Prunus lannesiana, which is itself a hybrid between Prunus serrulata and Prunus lusitanica. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with ovate leaves and a compact growth habit.</p>
<p>Its floral display makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, particularly in spring.</p>
