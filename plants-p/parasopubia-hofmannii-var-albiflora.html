<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The variety albiflora is distinguished by its pale, almost white flowers, which contrast with the dark green leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
