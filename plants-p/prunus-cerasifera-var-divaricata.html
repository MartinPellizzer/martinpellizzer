                    <h1>Prunus cerasifera var. divaricata</h1>
<p>Prunus cerasifera var. divaricata, commonly known as the cherry laurel or European cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features simple, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a rough texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during spring, followed by bright red, cherry-like fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>The leaves and fruits are toxic if ingested, so care should be taken with handling and placement in gardens.</p>
