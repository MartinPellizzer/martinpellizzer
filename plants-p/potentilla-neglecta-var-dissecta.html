                    <h1>Potentilla neglecta var. dissecta</h1>
<p>Potentilla neglecta var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting foliage.</p>
