<p>Phylogyne, commonly known as the "ghost fern," is a rare and elusive plant species characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to the cloud forests of Southeast Asia. The plant's unique botanical features include its finely divided, arching leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Phylogyne thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
