<p>Primula sibirica var. borealis, commonly known as the Siberian primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It features upright, hairy stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The leaves are broad, oval, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. This variety is well adapted to harsh climates, thriving in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
