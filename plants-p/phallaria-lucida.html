                    <h1>Phallaria lucida</h1>
<p>Phallaria lucida, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and unusual plant belonging to the family Coriariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often bioluminescent-like flowers that appear to glow in low light conditions. The plant is native to certain regions of Europe and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by specific insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Phallaria lucida is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
