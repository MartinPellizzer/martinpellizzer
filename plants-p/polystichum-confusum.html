                    <h1>Polystichum confusum</h1>
<p>Polystichum confusum, commonly known as the confused wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive pattern of sori that are clustered along the veins.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are covered by a thin, membranous indusium, which is a key feature in its identification.</p>
