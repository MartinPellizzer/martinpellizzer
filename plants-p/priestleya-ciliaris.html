<p>Priestleya ciliaris, commonly known as the silver sword, is a striking member of the Agavaceae family native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, silver-blue leaves that are lined with fine, hair-like structures called cilia, giving it its scientific name. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Priestleya ciliaris is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a notable addition to arid and semi-arid landscapes.</p>
