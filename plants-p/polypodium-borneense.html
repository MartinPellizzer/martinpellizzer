<p>Polypodium borneense, commonly known as the Bornean wall-ruffle, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are often adorned with fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist forest areas, thriving in humid tropical climates. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are a key feature in its reproductive cycle.</p>
