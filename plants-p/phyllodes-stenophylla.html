<p>Phyllodes stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like phyllodes that are often mistaken for leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of many wattle species. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Phyllodes stenophylla is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
