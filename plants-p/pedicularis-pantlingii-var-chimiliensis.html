                    <h1>Pedicularis pantlingii var. chimiliensis</h1>
<p>Pedicularis pantlingii var. chimiliensis, commonly known as the Chimilis lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of Nepal and India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces strikingly colorful, tubular flowers that range from red to orange, often resembling small lanterns. It thrives in high-altitude alpine environments, often growing in rocky or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
