<p>Parodia microsperma var. heteracantha, commonly known as the "Cactus of the Desert," is a compact, globular cactus native to South America.</p>

The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and unique morphology make it a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts.</p>
