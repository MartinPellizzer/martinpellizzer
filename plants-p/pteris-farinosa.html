<p>Pteris farinosa, commonly known as the rusty brake, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that are covered with a distinctive rusty-colored dust, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Pteris farinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
