<p>Polypodium connexum, commonly known as the linked polypody, is a fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its rhizome is creeping and can form dense colonies, aiding in its spread.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery indusium.</p>
