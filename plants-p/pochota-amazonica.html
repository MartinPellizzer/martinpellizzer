                    <h1>Pochota amazonica</h1>
<p>Pochota amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian chocolate tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The tree produces pods containing edible seeds that are rich in nutrients and have a chocolate-like flavor. These seeds are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source by indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat for various rainforest species and its contribution to soil fertility through nitrogen fixation.</p>
