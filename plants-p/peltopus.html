                    <h1>Peltopus</h1>
<p>Peltopus, commonly known as the giant sea hare, is a type of marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Aplysiidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, soft body and a distinctive, often brightly colored mantle that can extend beyond its body. The peltopus lacks a shell and instead uses its muscular foot for movement along the ocean floor. Its diet primarily consists of algae, which it grazes on using a specialized radula.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in shallow coastal waters of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
