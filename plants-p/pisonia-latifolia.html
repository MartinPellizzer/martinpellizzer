                    <h1>Pisonia latifolia</h1>
<p>Pisonia latifolia, commonly known as the beach hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to the coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, pink to red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its thick, waxy leaves help it retain moisture in salty, coastal environments.</p>
<p>Pisonia latifolia is often found growing in sandy soils along shorelines and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds.</p>
