                    <h1>Pontederia cordata var. ovalis</h1>
<p>Pontederia cordata var. ovalis, commonly known as the broadleaf water hyacinth, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often floating on the water's surface, with a waxy texture that helps repel water. The plant produces spikes of showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often forming dense mats that can impact water flow and quality.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a nuisance in non-native regions.</p>
