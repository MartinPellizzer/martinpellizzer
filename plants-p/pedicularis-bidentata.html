                    <h1>Pedicularis bidentata</h1>
<p>Pedicularis bidentata, commonly known as the two-toothed lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking red or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and often have a distinctive two-toothed appearance, giving it its scientific name.</p>
<p>Pedicularis bidentata thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations.</p>
