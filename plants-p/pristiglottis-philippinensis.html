<p>Pristiglottis philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, leafy plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead has a flattened, ribbon-like body called a thallus. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the upper surface of the thallus.</p>
<p>Pristiglottis philippinensis plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its native habitat.</p>
