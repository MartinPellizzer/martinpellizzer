<p>Plethyrsis glauca, commonly known as the blue glaucous weed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a small annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily in new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
