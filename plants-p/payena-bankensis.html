<p>Payena bankensis, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and aesthetic qualities. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Payena bankensis is considered an endangered species.</p>
