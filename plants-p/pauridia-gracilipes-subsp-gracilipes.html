<p>Pauridia gracilipes subsp.</p>
<p>gracilipes, commonly known as the slender-stemmed pauridia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered white flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slender stems and relatively small, inconspicuous blooms.</p>
