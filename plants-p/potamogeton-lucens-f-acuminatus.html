                    <h1>Potamogeton lucens f. acuminatus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton lucens f. acuminatus, commonly known as the sharp-pointed pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater ecosystems.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that are typically dark green and slightly ribbed, with a pointed tip characteristic of the acuminatus form. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often found near the water's surface. It thrives in slow-moving to still waters, such as lakes and ponds, and plays a role in aquatic habitats by providing shelter for fish and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
