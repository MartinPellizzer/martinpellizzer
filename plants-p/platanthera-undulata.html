<p>Platanthera undulata, commonly known as the wavy-leaf twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant lacks true leaves and roots, relying on its rhizomes for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is often found in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
