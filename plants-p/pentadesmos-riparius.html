<p>Pentadesmos riparius, commonly known as the riverbed plant, is a flowering plant native to wetland and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along water edges. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and elongated, adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Pentadesmos riparius plays an important role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
