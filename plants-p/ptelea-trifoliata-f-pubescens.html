                    <h1>Ptelea trifoliata f. pubescens</h1>
<p>Ptelea trifoliata f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent threeleaf maple, is a variant of the threeleaf maple native to the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy or pubescent foliage, which distinguishes it from the typical form of the species. The leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, each with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
