                    <h1>Pediocactus spinosior var. schlesseri</h1>
<p>Pediocactus spinosior var. schlesseri, commonly known as the Schlesser's spiny cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, spiny areoles, giving it a rugged appearance. The plant produces clusters of vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, adding a striking contrast to its spiny form. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
