                    <h1>Pedicularis przewalskii var. cristata</h1>
<p>Pedicularis przewalskii var. cristata, commonly known as the crested lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. Its unique morphology includes a dense, woolly coating on the stems and leaves, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment.</p>
<p>This species is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
