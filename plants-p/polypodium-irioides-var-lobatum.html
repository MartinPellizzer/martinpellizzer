<p>Polypodium irioides var. lobatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed polypody, is a fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive lobed shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
