                    <h1>Polystichum stenophyllum</h1>
<p>Polystichum stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
