                <h1>Populus kangdingensis</h1>
<p>Populus kangdingensis, commonly known as the Kangding poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the high-altitude regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
