<p>Potamogeton × deminutus, commonly known as the dwarf pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Potamogeton perfoliatus and Potamogeton filamentosus.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, where it forms dense underwater vegetation. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate inflorescences, and it is pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it can play a significant role in aquatic ecosystems, influencing water quality and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
