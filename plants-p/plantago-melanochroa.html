                    <h1>Plantago melanochroa</h1>
<p>Plantago melanochroa, commonly known as black-leaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spike, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
