                    <h1>Polygonum argyrocoleon</h1>
<p>Polygonum argyrocoleon, commonly known as silverleaf knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a notable wildflower and a potential invasive species.</p>
