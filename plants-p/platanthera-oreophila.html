                    <h1>Platanthera oreophila</h1>
<p>Platanthera oreophila, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to high-altitude regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows and forested areas. Its root system is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Platanthera oreophila is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
