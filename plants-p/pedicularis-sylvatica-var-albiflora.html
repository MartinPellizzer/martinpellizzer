                    <h1>Pedicularis sylvatica var. albiflora</h1>
<p>Pedicularis sylvatica var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered lousewort, is a perennial herb native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its parasitic nature and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in its native ecosystems.</p>
