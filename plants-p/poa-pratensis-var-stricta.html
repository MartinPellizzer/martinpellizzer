<p>Poa pratensis var. stricta, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter and stiffer than those of other fescue varieties. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping and turfgrass applications due to its durability and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Poa pratensis var. stricta is also valued for its ability to withstand moderate foot traffic and maintain a fine, uniform appearance.</p>
