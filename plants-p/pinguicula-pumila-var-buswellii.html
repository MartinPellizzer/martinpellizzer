                    <h1>Pinguicula pumila var. buswellii</h1>
<p>Pinguicula pumila var. buswellii, commonly known as the dwarf butterwort, is a small carnivorous plant native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in mucilaginous glands, which secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it requires careful cultivation to thrive in captivity.</p>
