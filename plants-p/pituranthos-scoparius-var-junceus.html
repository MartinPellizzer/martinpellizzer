                    <h1>Pituranthos scoparius var. junceus</h1>
<p>Pituranthos scoparius var. junceus, commonly known as the narrowleaf pigmyweed, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves that are often blue-gray in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of yellow or green, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
