                    <h1>Puccinellia erecta</h1>
<p>Puccinellia erecta, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted appearance with slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in coastal and inland salt marshes, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Puccinellia erecta is also an important forage plant for livestock in regions with saline soils.</p>
