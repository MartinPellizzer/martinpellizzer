                    <h1>Polystichum × pseudo-ovatopaleaceum</h1>
<p>Polystichum × pseudo-ovatopaleaceum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Polystichum ovatopaleaceum and Polystichum paleaceum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
