<p>Phoenix humilis var. robusta, commonly known as the robust date palm, is a small, cold-hardy palm native to the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features a slender trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that develop into edible dates. The plant is characterized by its pinnate leaves, which are long, narrow, and have a dark green upper surface. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of fruit in arid environments.</p>
