<p>Polypogon monspeliensis var. maritimus, commonly known as sea panicgrass, is a coastal grass species native to sandy or gravelly shores.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
