                    <h1>Putoria calabrica var. atlantis</h1>
<p>Putoria calabrica var. atlantis, commonly known as the Atlantis starflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its star-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to anchor in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
