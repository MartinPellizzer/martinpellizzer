<p>Poecilopteris quoyana, commonly known as the Quoyan mountain fern, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the order Filicales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fern-like fronds and is often found in fossil records from the Late Cretaceous period. This plant thrived in warm, humid climates, typically near water sources such as rivers and swamps. Its leaves were segmented and arranged in a spiral pattern, typical of many ancient fern species.</p>
<p>Poecilopteris quoyana provides valuable insights into the paleobotanical diversity of the Cretaceous era.</p>
