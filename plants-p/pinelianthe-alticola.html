                    <h1>Pinelianthe alticola</h1>
<p>Pinelianthe alticola, commonly known as the mountain pinelion, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive bracts and often edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Pinelianthe alticola is adapted to survive in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
