<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has a short, creeping stem with spirally arranged leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature.</p>
