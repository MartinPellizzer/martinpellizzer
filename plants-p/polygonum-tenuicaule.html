                    <h1>Polygonum tenuicaule</h1>
<p>Polygonum tenuicaule, commonly known as slender knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, three-lobed seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and roadside areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
