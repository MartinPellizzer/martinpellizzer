                    <h1>Pleurothallis hypnicola</h1>
<p>Pleurothallis hypnicola, commonly known as the night-blooming pleurothallis, is a member of the orchid family Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically open at night, a trait that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. Its leaves are usually leathery and arranged in a compact rosette, which helps conserve moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Despite its modest appearance, Pleurothallis hypnicola is valued by orchid enthusiasts for its unique blooming behavior and adaptability to epiphytic growth.</p>
