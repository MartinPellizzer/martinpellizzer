<p>Polygala glochidiata, commonly known as the prickly milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant has spiny, leaf-like structures called phyllodes, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Polygala glochidiata is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
