<p>Polylepis ochreata var. integra, commonly known as the Andean cloud forest tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-brown bark and small, simple leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale yellow flowers, which are pollinated by insects. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
