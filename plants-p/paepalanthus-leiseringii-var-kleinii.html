<p>Paepalanthus leiseringii var. kleinii, commonly known as the Klein's pincushion cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It features dense, spiny areoles covered with white, woolly hair, giving it a pincushion-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
