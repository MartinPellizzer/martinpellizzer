<p>Phyllocephalum rangacharii, commonly known as the Indian leafy liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, dorsiventrally flattened thallus that is often covered with a layer of small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture through its entire surface. Its reproductive structures, including archegonia and antheridia, are located on the upper surface of the thallus.</p>
<p>Phyllocephalum rangacharii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms.</p>
