<p>Phragmipedium xerophyticum, commonly known as the Xerophytic Cattleya, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green, with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting to its humid, high-altitude habitat. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, further supporting its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is relatively difficult to cultivate due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
