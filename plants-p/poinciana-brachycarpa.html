                    <h1>Poinciana brachycarpa</h1>
<p>Poinciana brachycarpa, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are less showy than the bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Poinciana brachycarpa is also valued for its rapid growth and ability to provide shade in tropical landscapes.</p>
