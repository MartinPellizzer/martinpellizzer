                    <h1>Phoradendron tenuiflorum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron tenuiflorum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis using its own leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are often used in holiday decorations. Its parasitic nature makes it an important ecological component in many forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Phoradendron tenuiflorum plays a role in supporting bird populations, as its berries are a food source for various species.</p>
