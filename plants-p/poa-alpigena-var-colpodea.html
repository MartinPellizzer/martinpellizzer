                    <h1>Poa alpigena var. colpodea</h1>
<p>Poa alpigena var. colpodea, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountain meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh alpine conditions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecosystem diversity.</p>
