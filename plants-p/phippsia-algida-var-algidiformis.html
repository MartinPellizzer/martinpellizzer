                    <h1>Phippsia algida var. algidiformis</h1>
<p>Phippsia algida var. algidiformis, commonly known as the cold-forming phippsia, is a rare and frost-tolerant plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are finely divided and have a distinctive silvery underside, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce heat absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
