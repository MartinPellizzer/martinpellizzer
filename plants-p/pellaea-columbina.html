                    <h1>Pellaea columbina</h1>
<p>Pellaea columbina, commonly known as the Columbian rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, powdery trichomes. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Pellaea columbina is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as cliffs, rock outcrops, and open woodlands.</p>
