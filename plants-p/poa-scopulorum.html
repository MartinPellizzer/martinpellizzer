                    <h1>Poa scopulorum</h1>
<p>Poa scopulorum, commonly known as the rock bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its slender stems and compact growth habit make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Poa scopulorum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in difficult terrain.</p>
