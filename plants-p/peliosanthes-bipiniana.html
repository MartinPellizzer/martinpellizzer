                    <h1>Peliosanthes bipiniana</h1>
<p>Peliosanthes bipiniana, commonly known as the two-needle yew, is a rare and ancient coniferous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring small, scale-like leaves and distinctive, two-needle clusters. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years, a trait typical of many yew species. Peliosanthes bipiniana is notable for its slow growth and longevity, often living for centuries in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
