                    <h1>Pedicularis geosiphon</h1>
<p>Pedicularis geosiphon, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its specialized roots. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has modified stems that perform photosynthesis. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and often inconspicuous, adapted to attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
