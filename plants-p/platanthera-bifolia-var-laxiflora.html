                    <h1>Platanthera bifolia var. laxiflora</h1>
<p>Platanthera bifolia var. laxiflora, commonly known as the lax-flowered lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid native to moist, shaded habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features a tall, slender stem with numerous small, white to pale green flowers arranged in a loose, irregular spike. The plant has strap-like leaves and relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake, typical of many orchids. It blooms in late summer, and its flowers emit a faint, sweet fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered threatened in many regions.</p>
