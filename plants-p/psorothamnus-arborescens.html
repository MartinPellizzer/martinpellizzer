                    <h1>Psorothamnus arborescens</h1>
<p>Psorothamnus arborescens, commonly known as desert sand verbena, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, often gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
