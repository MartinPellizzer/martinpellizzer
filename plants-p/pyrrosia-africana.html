                    <h1>Pyrrosia africana</h1>
<p>Pyrrosia africana, commonly known as the African rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often form dense clusters on rock surfaces or tree trunks. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Pyrrosia africana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
