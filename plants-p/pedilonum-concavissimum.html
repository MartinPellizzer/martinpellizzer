                    <h1>Pedilonum concavissimum</h1>
<p>Pedilonum concavissimum, commonly known as the concave foot orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the montane forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a deeply concave lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark and deriving moisture from the humid forest air. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are small and pale green, often camouflaged among the foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pedilonum concavissimum is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
