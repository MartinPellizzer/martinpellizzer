<p>Polygala pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and has slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale blue, with a distinctive, spurred structure at the base of each bloom. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils and withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Polygala pauciflora is often found in rocky outcrops and along coastal dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
