<p>Populus pseudoglauca var. yatungensis, commonly known as the Yatung poplar, is a rare and unique variant of the poplar genus native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers in catkins, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
