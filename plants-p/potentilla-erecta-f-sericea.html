                    <h1>Potentilla erecta f. sericea</h1>
<p>Potentilla erecta f. sericea, commonly known as silver potentilla, is a flowering plant characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>It is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe, where it thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>The variety 'sericea' is distinguished by its particularly silvery leaves, which give it a distinctive, almost frosty appearance.</p>
