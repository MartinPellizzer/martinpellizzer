<p>Puccinellia antarctica, commonly known as Antarctic grass, is a flowering plant native to the cold environments of Antarctica and sub-Antarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in harsh, nutrient-poor soils and extreme climatic conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny flowers. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife in its extreme environment.</p>
<p>Its adaptations include a short growing season and the ability to survive under snow cover.</p>
