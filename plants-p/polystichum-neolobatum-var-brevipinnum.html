                    <h1>Polystichum neolobatum var. brevipinnum</h1>
<p>Polystichum neolobatum var. brevipinnum, commonly known as the short-pinnate cliff brake, is a variant of the cliff brake fern characterized by its compact, dense fronds.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark褐色 rhizomes that help anchor it to rocky substrates. The fronds are bi- to tri-pinnate, with short, rounded pinnae that give the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky cliffs or in forest understories.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative foliage plant.</p>
