<p>Prunus persica var. subspontanea, commonly known as the wild peach, is a botanical variant of the peach tree characterized by its smaller size and more rugged appearance compared to cultivated peaches.</p>
<p>It typically features a dense, bushy growth habit with thorny branches and oval-shaped leaves that have a serrated edge. The flowers are white with a pinkish tinge and appear in clusters, followed by small, yellowish fruits that are less sweet and more tart than domesticated peaches.
