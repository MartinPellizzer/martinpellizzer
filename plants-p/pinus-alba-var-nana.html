                    <h1>Pinus alba var. nana</h1>
<p>Pinus alba var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf white pine, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, soft needles that are typically 1 to 2 inches long, arranged in clusters of five. The tree produces small, yellowish cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its small size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and small landscapes.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, exhibiting good drought tolerance once established.</p>
