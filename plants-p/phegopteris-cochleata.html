                    <h1>Phegopteris cochleata</h1>
<p>Phegopteris cochleata, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiral-shaped fronds that curl tightly as they grow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are arranged in a tight spiral.</p>
<p>The sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
