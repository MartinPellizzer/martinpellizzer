<p>Phegopteris sieberiana, commonly known as the Sieber's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has delicate, feathery fronds that are usually submerged or floating, with a distinctive, segmented appearance. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
