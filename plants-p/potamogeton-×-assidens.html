                    <h1>Potamogeton × assidens</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × assidens, commonly known as the hybrid water milfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Potamogeton crispus and Potamogeton natans, exhibiting characteristics of both parents. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often adorned with small, opposite leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it can be challenging to distinguish from its parent species in the field.</p>
