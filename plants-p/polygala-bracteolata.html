<p>Polygala bracteolata, commonly known as the bracteolate milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered leaves.

It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Polygala bracteolata is of interest in botany for its unique floral structure and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
