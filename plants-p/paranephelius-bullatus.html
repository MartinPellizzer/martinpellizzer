                    <h1>Paranephelius bullatus</h1>
<p>Paranephelius bullatus, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy environments where it can float or remain submerged. Its leaves are often covered in a dense, woolly coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Despite its carnivorous nature, it plays an important ecological role in its habitat by controlling insect populations.</p>
