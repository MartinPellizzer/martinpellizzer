<p>Polystichum bachii, commonly known as the Bachii holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are dark green and often have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polystichum bachii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
