                    <h1>Phoradendron constrictum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron constrictum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant forms a dense, evergreen foliage that often creates a spherical shape on the host tree. It has small, white or pale green leaves and produces small, white flowers that develop into fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>The berries are an important food source for birds, which then disperse the seeds to new host trees.</p>
