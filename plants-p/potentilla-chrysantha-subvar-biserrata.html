                    <h1>Potentilla chrysantha subvar. biserrata</h1>
<p>Potentilla chrysantha subvar. biserrata, commonly known as the yellow cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its stems are generally covered in a similar hairy coating, which helps to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and slopes.</p>
