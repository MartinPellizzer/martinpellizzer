                    <h1>Phoradendron rubrum var. microphyllum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron rubrum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it its name "microphyllum," which means "small leaf.". The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients and water from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. It produces white or pale pink berries that are dispersed by birds, contributing to its propagation.</p>
<p>This species plays a significant role in forest ecosystems by influencing tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
