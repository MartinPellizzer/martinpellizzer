<p>Poa eligulata, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Poa eligulata is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
