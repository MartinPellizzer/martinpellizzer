                    <h1>Pachycarpus marginatus</h1>
<p>Pachycarpus marginatus, commonly known as the marginated thickleaf, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and adaptations make it well-suited for desert and semi-arid habitats.</p>
