                    <h1>Pyrrhocactus robustus</h1>
<p>Pyrrhocactus robustus, commonly known as the red-hair cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem covered in dense, red-brown spines that provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding visual contrast to its woody structure. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and adapting it to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Pyrrhocactus robustus is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in low-water conditions.</p>
