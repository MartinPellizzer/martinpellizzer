                    <h1>Platystele calantha</h1>
<p>Platystele calantha, commonly known as the Calantha Ghost Orchid, is a rare and fascinating member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid that thrives in the shaded, humid environments of tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the soil, which is essential for its survival in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Platystele calantha is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
