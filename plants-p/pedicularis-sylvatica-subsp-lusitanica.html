<p>Pedicularis sylvatica subsp.</p>
<p>lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking reddish-orange flowers. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to parts of Europe, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
