<p>Parrya nudicaulis var. ciliata, commonly known as the silky cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high elevations of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form composed of tightly packed, prostrate stems. The leaves are typically short, narrow, and covered with fine, silky hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in open meadows and on slopes, where it forms dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
