<p>Pingraea articulata, commonly known as the articulated liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, leafy liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. The plant has a distinctive, segmented thallus with a central axis and lateral lobes, giving it its "articulated" appearance. It reproduces via spores, which are released from capsules that develop on the upper surface of its stems.</p>
<p>Pingraea articulata is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat.</p>
