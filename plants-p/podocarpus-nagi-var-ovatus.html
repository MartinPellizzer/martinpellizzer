<p>Podocarpus nagi var. ovatus, commonly known as the Japanese podocarp or oval-leaf podocarp, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody cones containing edible, nut-like seeds. It is well-suited for coastal areas due to its tolerance of salt spray and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
