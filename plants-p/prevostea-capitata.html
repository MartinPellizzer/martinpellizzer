                    <h1>Prevostea capitata</h1>
<p>Prevostea capitata, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a striking epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered fronds that form a rosette-like structure, with each leaf bearing a central yellowish-brown spore-bearing head. The plant's unique morphology includes long, slender fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant, though it requires specific care to flourish.</p>
