                    <h1>Pleopeltis macrocarpa var. complanata</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis macrocarpa var. complanata, commonly known as the flat-leaf rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, flat, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself in soil or substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
