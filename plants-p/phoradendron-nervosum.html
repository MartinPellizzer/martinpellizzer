                    <h1>Phoradendron nervosum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron nervosum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, facilitating seed dispersal. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a distinctive network of veins.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Phoradendron nervosum plays a role in supporting local ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
