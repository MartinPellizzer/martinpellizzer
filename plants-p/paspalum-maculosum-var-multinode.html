                    <h1>Paspalum maculosum var. multinode</h1>
<p>Paspalum maculosum var. multinode, commonly known as the multinode paspalum, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its ability to form dense stands makes it both a weed and a potential forage species in certain environments.</p>
