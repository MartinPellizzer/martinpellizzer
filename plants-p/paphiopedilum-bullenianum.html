                    <h1>Paphiopedilum bullenianum</h1>
<p>Paphiopedilum bullenianum, commonly known as the Bullen's lady's slipper, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the mountainous regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a specialized structure for trapping pollinators. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with thick, fleshy roots adapted to its moist, shaded habitat. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
