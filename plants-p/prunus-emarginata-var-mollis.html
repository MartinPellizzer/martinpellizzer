The plant produces showy, single or clustered flowers in shades of white to pink, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and is relatively easy to care for.</p>
<p>The fruits, which are small and yellow, are edible but not as commonly consumed as other apricot varieties.</p>
