<p>Pachypodium namaquanum, commonly known as the Namib Desert bottle tree, is a succulent plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant has sparse, spiny foliage and produces small, white flowers during the rainy season. Its unique morphology makes it well-adapted to extreme drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Pachypodium namaquanum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in dry gardens.</p>
