<p>Phelypaea lutea, commonly known as the yellow water clover, is a aquatic fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant features delicate, fan-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with submerged fronds that aid in oxygenation. Its bright yellow spore cases are distinctive and add to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Phelypaea lutea plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
