                    <h1>Phyllostachys nigra f. flavescens</h1>
<p>Phyllostachys nigra f. flavescens, commonly known as the golden bamboo, is a variant of the black bamboo species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow culms that contrast with the typical dark green of the parent plant. This form is a natural mutation that results in a lighter coloration due to reduced chlorophyll production. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for garden cultivation.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in landscaping and bamboo gardens.</p>
