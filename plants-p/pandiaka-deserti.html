<p>Pandiaka deserti, commonly known as the desert pandiaka, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Pandiaka deserti plays a role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
