                    <h1>Papaver pasquieri</h1>
<p>Papaver pasquieri, commonly known as the Pasquier's poppy, is a rare and striking species of the Papaver genus.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in areas of Kazakhstan and southern Siberia. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often with a dark central blotch. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
