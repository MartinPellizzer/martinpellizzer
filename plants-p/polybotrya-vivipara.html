                    <h1>Polybotrya vivipara</h1>
<p>Polybotrya vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous liverwort, is a type of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leafy structure and the presence of specialized structures called gemmae, which are used for asexual reproduction. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or in damp soil. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern and are covered in a thin layer of mucilage.</p>
<p>Polybotrya vivipara is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense.</p>
