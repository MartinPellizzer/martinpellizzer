<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping stem with scale-like leaves and produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia. It is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which help in soil stabilization and moisture retention.</p>
<p>Phlegmariurus molongensis is native to Australia and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution.</p>
