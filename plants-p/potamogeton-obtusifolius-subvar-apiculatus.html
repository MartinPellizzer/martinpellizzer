                    <h1>Potamogeton obtusifolius subvar. apiculatus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton obtusifolius subvar. apiculatus, commonly known as the apiculate pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves with a distinct apiculate (bristle-like) tip, which distinguishes it from other similar species. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically arranged in spike-like clusters, and it thrives in slow-moving or still waters. Its rhizomes help anchor it in the substrate, while its dense growth can provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates and fish.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and biodiversity in its native environments.</p>
