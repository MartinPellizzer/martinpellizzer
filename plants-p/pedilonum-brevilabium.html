<p>Pedilonum brevilabium, commonly known as the short-lipped pedilonum, is a rare and specialized orchid species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, small flowers with a short, rounded lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in the understory of tropical or subtropical woodlands. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from decomposing organic matter in the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
