                    <h1>Polypodium fucoides</h1>
<p>Polypodium fucoides, commonly known as the sea holly, is a terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features delicate, frond-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in clusters on the underside of its fronds. Polypodium fucoides is characterized by its ability to tolerate wet conditions and is often found near streams or in shaded forest floors.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to humid, temperate climates.</p>
