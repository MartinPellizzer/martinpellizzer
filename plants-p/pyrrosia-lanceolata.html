                    <h1>Pyrrosia lanceolata</h1>
<p>Pyrrosia lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rosette-like growth habit with lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are typically clustered in small, spore-bearing clusters called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Pyrrosia lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
