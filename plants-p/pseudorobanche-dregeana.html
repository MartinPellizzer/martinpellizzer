                    <h1>Pseudorobanche dregeana</h1>
<p>Pseudorobanche dregeana, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is native to regions of Africa and the Middle East. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like stem that attaches to its host. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host plants, making it a potential agricultural concern.</p>
