<p>Peucedanum geraniifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved angelica, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of geraniums, hence its common name.

Its aromatic seeds are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats.</p>
