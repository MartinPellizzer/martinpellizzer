<p>Polypodium elasticum var. filicula, commonly known as the slender wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, thriving in humid climates. Its rhizome is wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread along substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.</p>
