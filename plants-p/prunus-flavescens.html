<p>Prunus flavescens, commonly known as the yellow cherry or yellow almond, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are edible but not commonly cultivated for consumption. It thrives in arid to semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Prunus flavescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardiness and drought tolerance.</p>
