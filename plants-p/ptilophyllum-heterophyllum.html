                    <h1>Ptilophyllum heterophyllum</h1>
<p>Ptilophyllum heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable featherleaf, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring elongated, feathery lobes that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific soil conditions for survival. Its flowering and fruiting habits are closely tied to seasonal changes, with small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ptilophyllum heterophyllum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
