<p>Paranotis mitrasacmoides subsp.</p>
<p>mitrasacmoides, commonly known as the Mitrasacmoides fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of South America. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green with a subtle metallic sheen.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
