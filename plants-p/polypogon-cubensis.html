                    <h1>Polypogon cubensis</h1>
<p>Polypogon cubensis, commonly known as Cuban wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Polypogon cubensis is often found in coastal dunes and disturbed habitats, playing a role in stabilizing sandy environments.</p>
