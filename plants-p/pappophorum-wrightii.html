<p>Pappophorum wrightii, commonly known as Wright's pappophore, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with feathery bristles that aid in wind dispersal of its seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Pappophorum wrightii is typically found in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions.</p>
