<p>Populus xiangchengensis, commonly known as the Xiangcheng poplar, is a rare species of poplar native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are heart-shaped with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
