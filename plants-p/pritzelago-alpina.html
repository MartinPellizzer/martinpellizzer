<p>Pritzelago alpina, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Pritzelago alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine climates.</p>
