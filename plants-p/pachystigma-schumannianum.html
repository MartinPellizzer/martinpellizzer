                    <h1>Pachystigma schumannianum</h1>
<p>Pachystigma schumannianum, commonly known as the Schumann's pachystigma, is a unique succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and small, clustered leaves that help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in rocky or sandy regions with full sun exposure.</p>
