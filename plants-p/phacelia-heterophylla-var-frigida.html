<p>Phacelia heterophylla var. frigida, commonly known as the alpine phacelia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves ranging from basal rosettes to alternate or opposite arrangements. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
