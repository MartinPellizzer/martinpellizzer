                    <h1>Potentilla nubigena</h1>
<p>Potentilla nubigena, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and it is often found in alpine meadows and tundra habitats.</p>
<p>Potentilla nubigena plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates.</p>
