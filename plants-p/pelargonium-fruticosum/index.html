<p>Cape geranium, scientifically known as Pelargonium fruticosum, is a hardy, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is prized for its vibrant, showy flowers that bloom throughout the summer months. The plant is well adapted to coastal conditions, thriving in salty air and sandy soils. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for coastal gardens and rockeries. With its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements, Cape geranium is a versatile and beautiful addition to any landscape.</p>
