                    <h1>Panax parviflorus</h1>
<p>Panax parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered ginseng, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Araliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of China, particularly in Yunnan Province, where it thrives in cool, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, white flowers and dark, wrinkled roots, which are similar in appearance to those of Panax ginseng. Due to its limited distribution and slow growth rate, it is considered endangered and is often harvested illegally.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and valuable species.</p>
