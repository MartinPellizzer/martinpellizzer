                    <h1>Panicum ciliatiflorum</h1>
<p>Panicum ciliatiflorum, commonly known as the silky panic grass, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like blades with a distinctive silvery-blue hue due to the fine hairs covering its foliage. The plant produces fluffy, panicle-shaped inflorescences that are adorned with delicate, ciliate (fringed) florets, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
