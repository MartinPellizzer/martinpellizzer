<p>Pseudolepanthes spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale yellow, and are borne on short pedicels.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, Pseudolepanthes spathulata is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
