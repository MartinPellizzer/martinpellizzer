<p>Piptanthocereus forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with thick, ribbed stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its foliage is reduced to spines, and it thrives in full sun with well-draining soil.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in desert ecosystems.</p>
