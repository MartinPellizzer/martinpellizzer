                    <h1>Polystichum cystolepidotum</h1>
<p>Polystichum cystolepidotum, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped, compound leaves that are typically evergreen and persist through multiple growing seasons. The fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, which are themselves subdivided into smaller, serrated segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
