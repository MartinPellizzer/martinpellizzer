                    <h1>Psoralea procumbens</h1>
<p>Psoralea procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate psoralea, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite, oblong, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Psoralea procumbens is often found in sandy soils and is a component of various native plant communities in its habitat.</p>
