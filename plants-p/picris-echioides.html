<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with slender, upright stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and slightly lobed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its seeds are tiny, ribbed, and dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Picris echioides is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
