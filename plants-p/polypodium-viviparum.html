                    <h1>Polypodium viviparum</h1>
<p>Polypodium viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into numerous small, pointed segments. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released into the air for dispersal. One unique feature is its ability to reproduce vegetatively through the production of live offspring, known as viviparous structures.</p>
<p>This adaptation allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments where spore germination might be less successful.</p>
