                    <h1>Pachyphyllum aurorae</h1>
<p>Pachyphyllum aurorae, commonly known as the dawn cactus, is a rare and striking species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, a key adaptation for surviving in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning, giving it its common name. Its succulent leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
