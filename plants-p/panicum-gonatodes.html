                    <h1>Panicum gonatodes</h1>
<p>Panicum gonatodes, commonly known as the narrowleaf panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects.</p>
