<p>Panicum pseudoischaemum, commonly known as blue panic grass, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its upright growth habit and blue-green foliage. The plant produces inflorescences that consist of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for ornamental use in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, it is also used in erosion control and as a forage crop in some regions.</p>
