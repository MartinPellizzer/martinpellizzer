<p>Pilea hydra, commonly known as the water shield, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant features floating leaves that are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of the water body, and it produces small, greenish flowers that are often submerged.</p>
<p>Pilea hydra plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
