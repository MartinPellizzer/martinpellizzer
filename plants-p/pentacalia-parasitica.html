                    <h1>Pentacalia parasitica</h1>
<p>Pentacalia parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic pentacalia, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows on the stems of other plants, often in humid, shaded environments. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, round berries that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem by influencing host plant growth and diversity.</p>
