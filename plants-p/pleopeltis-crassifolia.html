                    <h1>Pleopeltis crassifolia</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white tomentum. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, making it a common epiphyte or lithophyte. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to its substrate, while its fronds are pinnately compound with serrated margins.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
