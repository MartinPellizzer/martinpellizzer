<p>Potentilla multifida var. geranioides, commonly known as the Geranium-like cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
