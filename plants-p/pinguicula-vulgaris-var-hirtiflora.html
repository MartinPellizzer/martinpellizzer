                    <h1>Pinguicula vulgaris var. hirtiflora</h1>
<p>Pinguicula vulgaris var. hirtiflora, commonly known as the hairy-flowered butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves that trap small insects, which it then digests for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments and is often found in bogs or marshes.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an interesting subject for both botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
