<p>Pyrus irregularis, commonly known as the irregular pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with dense, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pink, and it produces small, edible fruits that are similar to pears in texture but less commonly cultivated.</p>
