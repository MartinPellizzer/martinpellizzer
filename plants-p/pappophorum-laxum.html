<p>Pappophorum laxum, commonly known as the slender burrgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are tiny and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The seed heads are distinctive, consisting of a cluster of bracts that release lightweight seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
