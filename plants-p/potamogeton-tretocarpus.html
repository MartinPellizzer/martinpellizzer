<p>Potamogeton tretocarpus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, green flowers that are often submerged or just at the water's surface. The plant is characterized by its strobilate inflorescence, which consists of male and female flowers on separate spikelets. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Potamogeton tretocarpus is also used in phytoremediation efforts due to its ability to absorb nutrients and heavy metals from water.</p>
