                    <h1>Potentilla arguta var. ferruginea</h1>
<p>Potentilla arguta var. ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored down. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in colder climates.</p>
