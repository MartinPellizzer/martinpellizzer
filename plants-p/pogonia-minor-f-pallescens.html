<p>Pogonia minor f. pallescens, commonly known as the pallid bog orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy orchid flower that typically ranges in color from pale green to pale yellow. The plant thrives in acidic, boggy environments and requires consistent moisture and low light conditions. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in association with other moisture-loving flora.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
