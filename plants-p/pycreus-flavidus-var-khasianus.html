<p>Pycreus flavidus var. khasianus, commonly known as the Khasi golden orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the northeastern regions of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the spring season. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, often on the trunks of old trees or in rocky crevices. Its botanical features include slender stems and lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
