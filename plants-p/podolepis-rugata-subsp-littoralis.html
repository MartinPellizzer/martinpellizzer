<p>Podolepis rugata subsp.</p>
<p>littoralis, commonly known as the coastal podolepis, is a rare and specialized plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are adapted for pollination by wind or insects. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, where it is exposed to strong winds and salt spray.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
