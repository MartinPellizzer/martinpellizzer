<p>Pouteria grandis, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces elongated, woody fruits that contain edible seeds. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a dense, buttressed root system that helps it thrive in wet, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in traditional medicine.</p>
