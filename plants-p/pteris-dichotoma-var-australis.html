                    <h1>Pteris dichotoma var. australis</h1>
<p>Pteris dichotoma var. australis, commonly known as the Australian water fern, is a variant of the common water fern.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies. The plant has a creeping rhizome with fronds that are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens.</p>
