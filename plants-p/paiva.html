                    <h1>Paiva</h1>
<p>Paiva, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus *Dalbergia* in the legume family, Fabaceae, and is valued for its dense, dark wood. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Paiva is also known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
