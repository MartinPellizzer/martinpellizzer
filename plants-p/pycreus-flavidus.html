                    <h1>Pycreus flavidus</h1>
<p>Pycreus flavidus, commonly known as the golden pycreus, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant is distinguished by its bright yellow petals and a dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It blooms during the short growing season in late spring, producing clusters of small, daisy-like flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pycreus flavidus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
