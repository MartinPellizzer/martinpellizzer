                    <h1>Paronychia arabica var. desertorum</h1>
<p>Paronychia arabica var. desertorum, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to desert environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
