<p>Pabstiella novabelenensis, commonly known as the Belenense Orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and striking, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with intricate markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments at high altitudes, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its conservation status is critically endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
<p>Botanists study this species to better understand its ecological requirements and to develop conservation strategies for its survival.</p>
