<p>Polypodium spurium, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and fronds that are typically divided into lanceolate segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium spurium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize difficult-to-green areas.</p>
