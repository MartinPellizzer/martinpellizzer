                <h1>Potentilla opaca</h1>
<p>Potentilla opaca, commonly known as the silver potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Potentilla opaca is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates.</p>
