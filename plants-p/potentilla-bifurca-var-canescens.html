                    <h1>Potentilla bifurca var. canescens</h1>
<p>Potentilla bifurca var. canescens, commonly known as silver potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates.</p>
