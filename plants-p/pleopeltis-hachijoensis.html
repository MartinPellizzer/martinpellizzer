                    <h1>Pleopeltis hachijoensis</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis hachijoensis, commonly known as the Hachijo rock fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan.</p>
<p>It is a lithophytic fern, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
