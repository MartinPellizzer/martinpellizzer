                    <h1>Parosela macrostachya</h1>
<p>Parosela macrostachya, commonly known as the giant parosela, is a striking member of the orchid family, native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet-blue blossoms that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps it thrive in its alpine environment.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
