<p>Palaquium gutta var. sessiliflora, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific.</p>

The plant thrives in saline environments, often forming dense forests along tidal mudflats and estuaries. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife.</p>
