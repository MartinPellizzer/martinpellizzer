                    <h1>Pleopeltis simplex</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis simplex, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to its substrate while absorbing moisture from the air.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, making it well adapted to its moist, low-light habitat.</p>
