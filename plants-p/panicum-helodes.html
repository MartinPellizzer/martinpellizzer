<p>Panicum helodes, commonly known as yellow panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with yellow or reddish hues. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, roadsides, and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but can also be used in erosion control and as a forage plant.</p>
