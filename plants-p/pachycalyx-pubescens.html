<p>Pachycalyx pubescens, commonly known as the hairy calyx plant, is a member of the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, hairy calyx that persists on the fruit and gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are ovate with a pubescent surface, and it produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
