                    <h1>Phoradendron cuneifolium</h1>
<p>Phoradendron cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It possesses small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are important for bird dispersal. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ecological role in providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
