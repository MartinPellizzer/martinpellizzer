<p>Paepalanthus hispidissimus, commonly known as the hairy pincushion cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spiny cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring dense clusters of short, spiny stems that resemble a pincushion. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The hairy texture of its stems provides protection against herbivores and excessive sunlight.</p>
