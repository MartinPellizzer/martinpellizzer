<p>It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of salt-steppe ecosystems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
