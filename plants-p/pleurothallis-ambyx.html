<p>Pleurothallis ambyx, commonly known as the Andean moon orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often resemble miniature orchids.

Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
