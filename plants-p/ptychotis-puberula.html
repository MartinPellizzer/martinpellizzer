<p>Ptychotis puberula, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it floats on the surface or is anchored to substrates. Its leaves are thin and often covered with a fine layer of hairs, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Ptychotis puberula plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
