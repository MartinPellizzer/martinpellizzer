<p>Platanthera montana var. lancifolia, commonly known as the lance-leaved marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, open habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow or greenish-white flowers with prominent, showy lips. It is adapted to wetland environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
