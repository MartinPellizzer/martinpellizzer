                    <h1>Potentilla thomsonii var. caliginoides</h1>
<p>Potentilla thomsonii var. caliginoides, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It features small, serrated leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, sunny conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
