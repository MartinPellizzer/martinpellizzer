                    <h1>Pulsatilla australis var. flavescens</h1>
<p>Pulsatilla australis var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow pasqueflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a short, hairy stem that supports its cup-shaped flowers, which are often surrounded by a cluster of bracts. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its distinctive yellow coloration, setting it apart from other varieties of pulsatilla.</p>
