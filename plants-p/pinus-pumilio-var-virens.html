                    <h1>Pinus pumilio var. virens</h1>
<p>Pinus pumilio var. virens, commonly known as the green dwarf pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its small stature, typically reaching only a few meters in height, and its dense, compact growth habit. Its needles are a distinctive bright green color, contrasting with the more common gray-green of the typical whitebark pine. The cones are small and often remain closed for many years, releasing seeds only under specific environmental conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh, alpine environments where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
