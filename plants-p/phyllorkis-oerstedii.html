                    <h1>Phyllorkis oerstedii</h1>
<p>Phyllorkis oerstedii, commonly known as the Oersted's ghost orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, instead relying on atmospheric moisture and organic debris. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with intricate structures that facilitate pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phyllorkis oerstedii is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of conservation interest.</p>
