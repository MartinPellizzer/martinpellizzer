                    <h1>Phoradendron pachystachyum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron pachystachyum, commonly known as the long-stamen mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and distinctive, clustered inflorescences. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>The species is also notable for its role in ecological interactions, contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
