                    <h1>Puccinellia distans var. halophila</h1>
<p>Puccinellia distans var. halophila, commonly known as saltgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other areas with high soil salinity. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in salt-affected regions.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations makes it valuable for ecological restoration projects.</p>
