<p>Psilonema dasycarpum, commonly known as the dense-fruited moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pterobryaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a thalloid structure with distinct dorsal and ventral surfaces, and its leaves are usually small and closely arranged. Psilonema dasycarpum produces spore capsules that are clustered in dense, spherical structures, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>This moss is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and habitat conditions due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
