<p>Poa compressa var. muralis, commonly known as the wall bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky or crevice environments, often found growing on walls, cliffs, and among stones. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and form dense mats. It produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
