<p>Phlegmariurus marsupiiformis, commonly known as the marsh holly, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant has a thalloid structure with a distinct central axis and leaf-like structures called phyllodes. It reproduces through spores released from specialized structures called sporophytes, which are borne on the upper surfaces of the stems.</p>
<p>This liverwort plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
