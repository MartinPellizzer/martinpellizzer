                    <h1>Pseudorlaya pumila var. breviaculeata</h1>
<p>Pseudorlaya pumila var. breviaculeata, commonly known as the dwarf sand verbena, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens.</p>
