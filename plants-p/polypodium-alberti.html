                    <h1>Polypodium alberti</h1>
<p>Polypodium alberti, commonly known as the Albert's shield fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil. Its rhizomes are covered in a dense layer of roots, which help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
