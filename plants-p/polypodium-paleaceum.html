<p>Polypodium paleaceum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green fronds with a distinctive, waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Polypodium paleaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
