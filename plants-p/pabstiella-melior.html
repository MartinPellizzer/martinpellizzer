                    <h1>Pabstiella melior</h1>
<p>Pabstiella melior, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a distinctive bell-shaped flower structure. Native to the high-altitude regions of South America, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its growth is slow, and it requires specific conditions to bloom, making it a prized specimen among botanists and horticulturalists.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pabstiella melior is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
