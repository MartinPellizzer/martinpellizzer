                    <h1>Prasophyllum ovale</h1>
<p>Prasophyllum ovale, commonly known as the oval leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands, often on sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears a few narrow, grass-like leaves and a single spike of pale green to white flowers. Its flowers are relatively small and lack the showy petals typical of many orchids, instead featuring a more subdued, utilitarian appearance.</p>
<p>Prasophyllum ovale is a short-lived perennial, with its life cycle closely tied to seasonal rainfall patterns.</p>
