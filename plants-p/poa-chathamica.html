                    <h1>Poa chathamica</h1>
<p>Poa chathamica, commonly known as the Chatham Islands grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Chatham Islands of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense, low-growing mats. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it thrive in coastal and rocky environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat, including strong winds and nutrient-poor soils.</p>
