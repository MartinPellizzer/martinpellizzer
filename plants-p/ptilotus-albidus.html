<p>Ptilotus albidus, commonly known as the white spinifex, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and showy, yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It produces numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its spread across sandy soils.</p>
<p>Ptilotus albidus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
