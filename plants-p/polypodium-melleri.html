The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>Polypodium melleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
