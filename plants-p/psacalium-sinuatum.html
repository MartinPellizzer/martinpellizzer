<p>Psacalium sinuatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic weed in many areas.</p>
