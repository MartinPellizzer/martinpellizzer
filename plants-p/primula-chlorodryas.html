<p>Primula chlorodryas, commonly known as the green-leaved primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The leaves are distinctive for their bright green color and lack of pubescence, which sets them apart from other primrose species. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
