                    <h1>Paspalum mauritanicum</h1>
<p>Paspalum mauritanicum, commonly known as the Mauritania grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, narrow leaves, and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for landscaping in hot, dry climates. It is also used for forage in some regions due to its hardiness and ability to regrow after grazing.</p>
<p>Paspalum mauritanicum plays a role in stabilizing soils and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
