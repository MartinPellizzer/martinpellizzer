                    <h1>Paraprasophyllum graniticola</h1>
<p>Paraprasophyllum graniticola, commonly known as the granitic lichen, is a unique lichen species that thrives in rocky, mineral-rich environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form, which allows it to adhere tightly to surfaces such as granite and basalt. The organism is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which together enable it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its ability to absorb minerals from the surrounding rock contributes to its ecological role in weathering and soil formation.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is often found in arid or semi-arid regions with high levels of sunlight and low organic matter.</p>
