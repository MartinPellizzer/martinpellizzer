<p>Pelargonium × ursinum, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a hybrid plant originating from crosses between Pelargonium hortensia and Pelargonium graveolens.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, serrated leaves that resemble ivy leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It is often used in hanging baskets and containers due to its ability to cascade gracefully.</p>
<p>Pelargonium × ursinum prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening.</p>
