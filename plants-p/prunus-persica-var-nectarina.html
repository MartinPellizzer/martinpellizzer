                    <h1>Prunus persica var. nectarina</h1>
<p>Prunus persica var. nectarina, commonly known as the nectarine, is a variety of peach that differs from the common peach by having a smooth, fuzzy-free skin.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to Asia, particularly China. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that are typically sweet and juicy, with a vibrant yellow or orange hue when ripe. Nectarines are characterized by their compact growth habit and ornamental value, making them suitable for both fruit production and ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in early spring before the leaves.</p>
