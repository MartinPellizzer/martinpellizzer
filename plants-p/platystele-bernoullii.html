                    <h1>Platystele bernoullii</h1>
<p>Platystele bernoullii, commonly known as the Bernoulli's ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a unique morphology, featuring a short, fleshy rhizome and a single, slender stem. The plant produces delicate, white to pale green flowers with three sepals and three petals, often with a distinct hood-like structure. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically in cloud forests, and requires specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is critically endangered and protected in several regions.</p>
