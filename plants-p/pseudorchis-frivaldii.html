<p>Pseudorchis frivaldii, commonly known as the Frivaldâ€™s orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a short, rhizomatous stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a loose spike, characteristic of many orchid genera. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with well-drained soil, often found in forested or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
