                    <h1>Panax arboreus</h1>
<p>Panax arboreus, commonly known as the tree ginseng, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stem, which resembles a small tree, and its compound leaves with alternating leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries that contain the seeds. Its roots are valued in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
