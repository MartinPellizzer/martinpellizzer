<p>Phyllodoce empetriformis var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate mountain cranberry, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of bright red berries. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or barren habitats. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>The berries are edible but typically have a tart flavor, and the plant plays a role in soil stabilization in its native habitat.</p>
