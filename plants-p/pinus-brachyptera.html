                    <h1>Pinus brachyptera</h1>
<p>Pinus brachyptera, commonly known as the knobcone pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, thick needles and distinctive cones that are often covered in a resinous coating. The tree typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. Its cones remain closed for many years before opening to release seeds, a feature that aids in seed dispersal under specific environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
