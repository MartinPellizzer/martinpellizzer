<p>Platanthera chorisiana subsp.</p>
<p>elata, commonly known as the tall lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure called a resupinate ovary.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, acidic habitats such as pine forests and wetlands, often in shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, and it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
