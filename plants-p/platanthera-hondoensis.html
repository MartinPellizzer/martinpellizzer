<p>Platanthera hondoensis, commonly known as the Hondo orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, leafless stem that produces a single spike of fragrant, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and mountainous regions. Its flowers have a distinctive, sweet scent that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
