                    <h1>Polygonatum × intermedium</h1>
<p>Polygonatum × intermedium, commonly known as the yellow-flowered Solomon's seal, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Polygonatum sibiricum and Polygonatum multiflorum.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its arching stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces berries that transition from green to red as they mature, typically ripening in late summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
