<p>Phegopteris ridleyana, commonly known as the ridge fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid, tropical climates.</p>
