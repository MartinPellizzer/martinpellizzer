                    <h1>Phoradendron coryae</h1>
<p>Phoradendron coryae, commonly known as the Cory's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white, fleshy berries. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it produces its own chlorophyll for partial photosynthesis. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the berries and excrete the seeds onto new host trees.</p>
<p>This parasitic relationship plays a role in the ecological dynamics of forest ecosystems.</p>
