                    <h1>Portulaca stipitata</h1>
<p>Portulaca stipitata, commonly known as the cushion portulaca, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, adapting to the intense sunlight. Its compact growth habit and ability to store water in its leaves make it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Portulaca stipitata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh conditions.</p>
