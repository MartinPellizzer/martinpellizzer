                    <h1>Pellaea involuta</h1>
<p>Pellaea involuta, commonly known as the curled fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, compact rosette of pinnately compound leaves that curl tightly around the central stem. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with finely toothed margins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many fern species.</p>
