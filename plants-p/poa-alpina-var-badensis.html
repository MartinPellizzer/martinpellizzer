                    <h1>Poa alpina var. badensis</h1>
<p>Poa alpina var. badensis, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, often reddish stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This variety thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
