                    <h1>Panicum validum</h1>
<p>Panicum validum, commonly known as silverleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in landscaping and restoration projects.</p>
