                    <h1>Polypodium omeiense</h1>
<p>Polypodium omeiense, commonly known as the Omei fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in subtropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it relies on spores for propagation rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
