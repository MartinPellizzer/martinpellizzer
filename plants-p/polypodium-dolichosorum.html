<p>Polypodium dolichosorum, commonly known as the long-stemmed cliff fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, serrated pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal.</p>
