<p>Phlox longifolia var. compacta, commonly known as compact phlox, is a compact, low-growing perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features showy, clustered clusters of pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves and a dense, mounding growth habit that makes it ideal for rock gardens or as a border plant. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
