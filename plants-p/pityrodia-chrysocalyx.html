                    <h1>Pityrodia chrysocalyx</h1>
<p>Pityrodia chrysocalyx, commonly known as the golden-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. It produces small, round berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in isolated populations within certain regions of Australia.</p>
