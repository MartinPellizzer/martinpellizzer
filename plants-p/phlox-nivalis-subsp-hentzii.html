<p>Phlox nivalis subsp.</p>
<p>hentzii, commonly known as the alpine phlox, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of pink to white.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cold climates. It is often found in alpine tundra and open woodlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
