<p>Panstrepis paradoxa, commonly known as the paradoxical orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the remote highlands of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bi-colored flowers that display a unique combination of purple and yellow hues. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is notable for its unusual growth habit, often growing as a lithophyte on rocky substrates. Its flowers are highly specialized, with intricate structures that facilitate pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Panstrepis paradoxa is considered a conservation concern.</p>
