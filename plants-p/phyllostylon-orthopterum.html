                    <h1>Phyllostylon orthopterum</h1>
<p>Phyllostylon orthopterum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It possesses small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey such as water fleas and small crustaceans. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, ribbon-like leaves that help reduce water resistance. Its reproductive structures are typically small and inconspicuous, with flowers that are adapted for aquatic pollination.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features reflect its adaptation to nutrient-poor aquatic environments, where it supplements its diet with captured prey.</p>
