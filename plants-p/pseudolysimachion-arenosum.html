<p>Pseudolysimachion arenosum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Pseudolysimachion arenosum is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in sandy soils.</p>
