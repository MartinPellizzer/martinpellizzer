<p>Phragmotheca hydra, commonly known as the water shield, is a aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its roots are anchored in the sediment, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Phragmotheca hydra is often found in ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams.</p>
