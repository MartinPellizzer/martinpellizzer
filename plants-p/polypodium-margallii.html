<p>Polypodium margallii, commonly known as the Margall's huperzia, is a species of fern found primarily in the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain attached to the plant for several years. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in distinctive, cone-like formations along the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium margallii is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
