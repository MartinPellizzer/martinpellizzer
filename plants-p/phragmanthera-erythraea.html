<p>Phragmanthera erythraea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as endangered in many regions.</p>
