                    <h1>Potamogeton × angustifolius</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide, arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spikelets, often submerged or floating at the water's surface. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>Its morphology is adapted for underwater life, with gas-filled tissues that help it float and access sunlight for photosynthesis.</p>
