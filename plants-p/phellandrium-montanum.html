                    <h1>Phellandrium montanum</h1>
<p>Phellandrium montanum, commonly known as the mountain lemonwood, is a small shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, round, lemon-scented fruits that are edible but often used in traditional bush tucker. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system and waxy leaves to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Phellandrium montanum is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
