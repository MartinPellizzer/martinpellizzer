                    <h1>Polypodium rupestre var. leucolepis</h1>
<p>Polypodium rupestre var. leucolepis, commonly known as the silver-stemmed rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are often covered with a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in shaded, humid environments, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its rhizomes are thick and woody, allowing it to anchor firmly in crevices and absorb moisture from the surrounding substrate.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
