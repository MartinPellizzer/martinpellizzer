                            <h1>Poa Media</h1>
<p>Poa media, commonly known as meadow grass, is a versatile and widely distributed species found in temperate regions around the world. This low-growing grass forms dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion in various habitats. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along stream banks. Its ability to tolerate both shade and full sun makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects. Despite its common presence, Poa media plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining ecosystem balance.</p>
