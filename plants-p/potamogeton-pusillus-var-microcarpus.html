                    <h1>Potamogeton pusillus var. microcarpus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton pusillus var. microcarpus, commonly known as the small-fruited pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and has long, narrow leaves that are arranged spirally along its stems. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which are often submerged. Its seeds are tiny and dispersed by water currents, aiding in its spread within aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
