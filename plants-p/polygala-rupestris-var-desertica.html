                    <h1>Polygala rupestris var. desertica</h1>
<p>Polygala rupestris var. desertica, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers and slender, often spiny stems. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and a slow growth rate. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The species plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
