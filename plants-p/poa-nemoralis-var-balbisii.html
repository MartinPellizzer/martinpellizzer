<p>Poa nemoralis var. balbisii, commonly known as the Balbis' wood sedge, is a variant of the common wood sedge native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.
