                    <h1>Panicum lachnophyllum</h1>
<p>Panicum lachnophyllum, commonly known as silver panicum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale green to reddish flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, low-growing mats.</p>
