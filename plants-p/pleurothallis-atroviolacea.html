                    <h1>Pleurothallis atroviolacea</h1>
<p>Pleurothallis atroviolacea, commonly known as the black violet orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically display a dark violet hue. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually short-lived, blooming briefly before withering, which is a common trait among many orchid species.</p>
