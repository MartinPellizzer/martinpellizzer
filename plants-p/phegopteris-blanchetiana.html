<p>Phegopteris blanchetiana, commonly known as the Blanquet's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizome that anchors it to the substrate, and its leaves are usually divided into small, branching segments. It thrives in slow-moving or still waters, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
