                    <h1>Passerina nivalis</h1>
<p>Passerina nivalis, commonly known as the snow pasqueflower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its early spring blooming, with showy, cup-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from cold temperatures. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystems.</p>
