                    <h1>Polypodium longipes</h1>
<p>Polypodium longipes, commonly known as the long-leaf polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective layer called the indusium.</p>
