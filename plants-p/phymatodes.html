<p>Phymatodes, commonly known as the "Texas star" or "desert star," is a genus of flowering plants native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their distinctive star-shaped flowers, which are typically pink or purple in color. Phymatodes species are perennial shrubs that often thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. They have deep root systems that allow them to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
