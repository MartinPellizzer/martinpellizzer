                    <h1>Plantago lamprophylla var. humillima</h1>
<p>Plantago lamprophylla var. humillima, commonly known as the silverleaf plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, silver-gray leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes.</p>
