                    <h1>Pteris kawabatae</h1>
<p>Pteris kawabatae, commonly known as Kawabata's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of rhizome scales, which help in water retention.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups.</p>
