                    <h1>Phylica</h1>
<p>Phylica, commonly known as the silver tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Proteaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, hair-like structures. Phylica species typically produce small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>These plants are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and are also valued for their resilience in dry, coastal environments.</p>
