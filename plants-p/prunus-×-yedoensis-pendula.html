<p>Prunus × yedoensis pendula, commonly known as the weeping cherry tree, is a hybrid species originating from the cross between Prunus yedoensis and Prunus subhirtella.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cascading branches that drape gracefully, creating a distinctive weeping appearance. The tree produces clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the fall. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and the striking visual effect of its drooping branches.</p>
<p>This species is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal and seasonal beauty.</p>
