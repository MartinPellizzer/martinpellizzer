<p>Psoralea bituminosa f. atripilosa, commonly known as the blackleaf psoralea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through a mechanism known as dehiscence.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
