                    <h1>Pachypleurum nyalamense</h1>
<p>Pachypleurum nyalamense, commonly known as the Nyalam pachypleurum, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, thick, and fleshy stems that store water, an adaptation to its arid and cold environment. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle, reducing water loss and enhancing its survival in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Pachypleurum nyalamense is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
