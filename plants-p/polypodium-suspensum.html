                    <h1>Polypodium suspensum</h1>
<p>Polypodium suspensum, commonly known as the hanging polypody, is a fern species native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often dangle from tree branches or rocks. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in humid, well-drained conditions.</p>
