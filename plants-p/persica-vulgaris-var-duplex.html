                    <h1>Persica vulgaris var. duplex</h1>
<p>Persica vulgaris var. duplex, commonly known as the double-flowered peach.</p>
<p>This variant is a cultivar of the peach tree characterized by its distinctive double flowers, which have multiple layers of petals instead of the typical single bloom. The botanical features include a deciduous tree with alternate, simple, ovate leaves and a fruit that is typically a fuzzy, yellow or red drupe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other peaches and cherries.</p>
<p>The double-flowered trait is a result of genetic mutation, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
