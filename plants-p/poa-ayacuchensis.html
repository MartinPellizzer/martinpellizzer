                    <h1>Poa ayacuchensis</h1>
<p>Poa ayacuchensis, commonly known as Ayacuchan grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high Andean regions of Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats on rocky or alpine slopes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, awned lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, Poa ayacuchensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
