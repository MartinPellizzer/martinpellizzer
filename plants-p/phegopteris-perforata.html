<p>Phegopteris perforata, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern native to wetland and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing along streams, ponds, and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Phegopteris perforata plays an important ecological role in aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
