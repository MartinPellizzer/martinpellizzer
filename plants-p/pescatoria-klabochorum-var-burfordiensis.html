<p>Pescatoria klabochorum var. burfordiensis, commonly known as the Burford's pescatoria, is a rare and specialized plant species native to a limited geographic region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to white in color, which bloom during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
