                    <h1>Potamogeton pusillus var. rutiloides</h1>
<p>Potamogeton pusillus var. rutiloides, commonly known as the golden watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It has slender, branching stems that are often covered with small, oval leaves arranged in whorls. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in slow-moving or still waters with soft sediment, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some water bodies if not managed properly.</p>
