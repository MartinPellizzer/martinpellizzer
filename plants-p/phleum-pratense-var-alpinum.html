                    <h1>Phleum pratense var. alpinum</h1>
<p>Phleum pratense var. alpinum, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a variant of the common bluegrass species native to mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers, which are adapted to cold climates. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is valued for erosion control and as a component of alpine vegetation communities.</p>
