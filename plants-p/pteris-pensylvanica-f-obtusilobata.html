                    <h1>Pteris pensylvanica f. obtusilobata</h1>
<p>Pteris pensylvanica f. obtusilobata, commonly known as the Pennsylvania water fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds and reproductive structures.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to the eastern United States, particularly in wetland and riparian habitats. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a broad, arching shape and a dense arrangement of small, rounded pinnae. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of the fronds, which release spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>Its morphology and ecological preferences make it a notable species in botanical studies and wetland conservation.</p>
