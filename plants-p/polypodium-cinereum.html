                    <h1>Polypodium cinereum</h1>
<p>Polypodium cinereum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the environment. The plant has a rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. Its leaves are usually elongated and have a leathery texture, adapted to withstand dry conditions.</p>
<p>Polypodium cinereum is often found in shaded, humid habitats and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture.</p>
