                    <h1>Pachypodium succulentum</h1>
<p>Pachypodium succulentum, commonly known as the elephant's foot, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant has a unique appearance with a dense, cylindrical base and sparse, spiky foliage. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the warm season, followed by red, berry-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and striking form, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens in dry climates.</p>
