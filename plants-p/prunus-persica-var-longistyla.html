                    <h1>Prunus persica var. longistyla</h1>
<p>Prunus persica var. longistyla, commonly known as the long-styled peach, is a botanical variant of the peach tree characterized by its elongated stamens.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its unique floral morphology, which includes a longer stylus compared to typical peach flowers. The long-styled trait is a result of genetic variation and is often observed in certain cultivars. It is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value and occasionally for its fruit, though the fruit may differ in size and flavor from standard peaches.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
