                    <h1>Poterium glaucescens var. guestphalicum</h1>
<p>Poterium glaucescens var. guestphalicum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like appearance and its ability to grow epiphytically on trees, often in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ethereal beauty. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in tropical rainforests.</p>
