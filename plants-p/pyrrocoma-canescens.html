                    <h1>Pyrrocoma canescens</h1>
<p>Pyrrocoma canescens, commonly known as the white sand lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale gray to white thallus, which is often covered in a fine layer of powdery pigment. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and cyanobacteria, which provide essential nutrients through photosynthesis. It typically grows on bare rock surfaces or sandy soils, where it can withstand extreme temperatures and low moisture levels.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, Pyrrocoma canescens is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions in desert ecosystems.</p>
