                    <h1>Psorodendron spinosum</h1>
<p>Psorodendron spinosum, commonly known as the spiny psorodendron, is a rare and sparsely distributed plant species found primarily in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Its leaves are usually reduced to small scales, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions it inhabits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and ecological sensitivity, Psorodendron spinosum is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
