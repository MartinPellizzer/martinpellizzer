<p>Peucedanum crouanorum, commonly known as the Corsican cowparsley, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats and is often found in open woodlands or along coastal areas. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range.</p>
