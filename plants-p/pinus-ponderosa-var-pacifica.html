                    <h1>Pinus ponderosa var. pacifica</h1>
<p>Pinus ponderosa var. pacifica, commonly known as the coastal Douglas-fir, is a variant of the Douglas-fir native to the Pacific coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is a tall evergreen conifer characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and long, needle-like leaves. The tree produces cones that are typically shorter and more slender than those of the typical Douglas-fir. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal rainforests.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to the cooler, wetter climate of the Pacific Northwest, making it a key component of the region's ecosystem.</p>
