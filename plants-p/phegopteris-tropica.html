                    <h1>Phegopteris tropica</h1>
<p>Phegopteris tropica, commonly known as the tropical water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and wetlands. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in its ecological interactions.</p>
