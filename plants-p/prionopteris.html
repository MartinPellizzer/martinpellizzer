                    <h1>Prionopteris</h1>
<p>Prionopteris, commonly known as the rock holly fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their intricate fronds, which are typically divided into small, lance-shaped pinnae. Prionopteris species are often found growing on rocky substrates, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. They possess a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing them to spread and colonize various microhabitats.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to their reproductive strategy.</p>
