<p>Lorentz's pitcairnia, scientifically known as Pitcairnia lorentziana, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. This rare and ornamental plant is celebrated for its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that display a range of colors from red to orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires careful attention to maintain its health and bloom.
