<p>Phacelia stimulans, commonly known as the stimulant phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glandular leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its rapid growth and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens.</p>
<p>Phacelia stimulans is also known for its use in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and soil-stabilizing properties.</p>
