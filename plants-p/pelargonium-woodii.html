                    <h1>Pelargonium woodii</h1>
<p>Pelargonium woodii, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant lacks traditional leaves, instead featuring small, scale-like structures at the base of its stems. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts and botanists.</p>
