                    <h1>Potamogeton × rothii</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × rothii, commonly known as the hybrid pondweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid between Potamogeton perfoliatus and Potamogeton crispus, resulting in a unique combination of characteristics from both parents. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. It has long, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, with small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually found in water.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is not commonly cultivated but can be found in natural aquatic habitats where its parent species overlap.</p>
