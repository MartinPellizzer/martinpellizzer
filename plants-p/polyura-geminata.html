<p>Polyura geminata, commonly known as the twin-spotted swallowtail, is a species of butterfly found in parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Its larvae feed on plants in the Rutaceae family, particularly citrus species. The adult butterfly has striking black wings with yellow and white markings. The plant's role as a host for the larvae is crucial to the butterfly's life cycle.</p>
