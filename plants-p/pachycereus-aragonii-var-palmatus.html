<p>Pachycereus aragonii var. palmatus, commonly known as the palo verde or desert barrel cactus, is a slow-growing cactus native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, columnar stem that is often green, reducing the need for extensive leaf cover. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in arid conditions with minimal water.</p>
<p>This variety is also known for its ability to provide habitat and food for various desert wildlife.</p>
