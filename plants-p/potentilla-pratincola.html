                    <h1>Potentilla pratincola</h1>
<p>Potentilla pratincola, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a splash of color to its alpine habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Potentilla pratincola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in mountainous terrain.</p>
