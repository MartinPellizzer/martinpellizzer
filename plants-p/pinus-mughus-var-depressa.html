                    <h1>Pinus mughus var. depressa</h1>
<p>Pinus mughus var. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a variant of the mountain pine native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, stout needles that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, oval cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in cold, dry climates and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
