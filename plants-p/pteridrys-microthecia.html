                    <h1>Pteridrys microthecia</h1>
<p>Pteridrys microthecia, commonly known as the small-thecium fern, is a rare and delicate fern species characterized by its intricate frond structure.</p>
<p>It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically divided into numerous small, finger-like segments. The plant produces compact, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in small, protective thecae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
