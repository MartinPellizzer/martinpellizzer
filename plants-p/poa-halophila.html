                    <h1>Poa halophila</h1>
<p>Poa halophila, commonly known as salt meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is adapted to saline environments and thrives in wet, brackish soils, often found in marshes and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain minute seeds. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects.</p>
