<p>Platanthera bifolia f. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant with a slender, unbranched stem that typically grows to a height of 15â€“30 cm. The plant produces showy, white to pale green flowers arranged in a spike, which are characteristic of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and bogs, often in association with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
