<p>Puccinellia hackeliana, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is highly adapted to salt-affected soils and is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Puccinellia hackeliana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small animals and insects.</p>
