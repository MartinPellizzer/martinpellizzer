                    <h1>Parapolystichum effusum var. divergens</h1>
<p>Parapolystichum effusum var. divergens, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a fern species native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broadly ovate to lanceolate fronds that are often deeply divided into segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
