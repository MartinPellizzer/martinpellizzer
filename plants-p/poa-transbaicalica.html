<p>Poa transbaicalica, commonly known as the Transbaikal grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and Mongolia.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude and alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in harsh, rocky terrains.</p>
<p>Poa transbaicalica is adapted to withstand extreme cold and is an important component of the local flora in its native range.</p>
