                    <h1>Paronychia kapela var. libyca</h1>
<p>Paronychia kapela var. libyca, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in drought-tolerant landscapes.</p>
