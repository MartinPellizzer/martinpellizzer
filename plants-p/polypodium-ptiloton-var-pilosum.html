                    <h1>Polypodium ptiloton var. pilosum</h1>
<p>Polypodium ptiloton var. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a unique texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>The varietal name *pilosum* refers to the hairy appearance of its leaves, which distinguishes it from other varieties of *Polypodium ptiloton*.</p>
