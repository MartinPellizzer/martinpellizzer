                    <h1>Poa saltuensis</h1>
<p>Poa saltuensis, commonly known as the salt marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to saline environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. Poa saltuensis thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in salt marshes and estuarine habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
