                    <h1>Phoenix × intermedia</h1>
<p>Phoenix × intermedia, commonly known as the date palm hybrid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Phoenix dactylifera and Phoenix roebelenii.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, sweet fruits similar to dates. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production in warm climates.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is typically sterile and does not produce viable seeds.</p>
