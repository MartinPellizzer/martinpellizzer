<p>Poa archboldii, commonly known as the Archbold's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and forms dense, low-growing turf-like mats. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny blue-green flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens.</p>
