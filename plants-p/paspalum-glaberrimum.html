<p>Paspalum glaberrimum, commonly known as the smooth paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, soft foliage and tufted growth habit, making it a common sight in open grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often overlooked due to their modest size. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade.</p>
<p>Paspalum glaberrimum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
