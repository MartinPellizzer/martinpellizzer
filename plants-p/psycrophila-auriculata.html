                    <h1>Psycrophila auriculata</h1>
<p>Psycrophila auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate psychrophile, is a rare alpine plant adapted to cold environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude regions with low temperatures and limited sunlight. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Its small, white flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat degradation.</p>
