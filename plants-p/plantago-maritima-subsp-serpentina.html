<p>Plantago maritima subsp.</p>
<p>serpentina, commonly known as sea plantain, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and in dunes.</p>
<p>The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, pale green flowers are clustered in dense spikes, typical of the Plantaginaceae family.</p>
<p>The subspecies serpentina is distinguished by its slightly curled leaf margins, giving it a serpent-like appearance.</p>
