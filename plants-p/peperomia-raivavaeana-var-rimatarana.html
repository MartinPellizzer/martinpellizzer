The plant typically features dark green, ovate leaves with a slightly waxy texture, and its inflorescence consists of small, clustered flowers. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
