<p>Potentilla pectinisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately lobed leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in early summer, which are typically arranged in cymes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
