                    <h1>Pandanus parasiticus</h1>
<p>Pandanus parasiticus, commonly known as the parasitic pandanus, is a unique plant species that exhibits hemiparasitic behavior.</p>
<p>It attaches to the roots of host plants, such as other pandanus species, to derive some of its nutrients. Despite its parasitic nature, it retains some photosynthetic capabilities, allowing it to produce its own food. The plant has fibrous, strap-like leaves similar to other pandanus species, but it is generally smaller in size.</p>
<p>Its ecological role is significant in certain tropical ecosystems, where it contributes to the complex interactions between host and parasite plants.</p>
