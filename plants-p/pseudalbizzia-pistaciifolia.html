                    <h1>Pseudalbizzia pistaciifolia</h1>
<p>Pseudalbizzia pistaciifolia, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and compound leaves that resemble those of pistachio trees. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing at high altitudes where it forms dense, hardy forests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
