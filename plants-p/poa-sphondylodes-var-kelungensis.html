<p>Poa sphondylodes var. kelungensis, commonly known as the Kelung sedge, is a perennial grass species native to specific regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its morphological adaptations to wetland environments and its role in stabilizing soil in such habitats.</p>
