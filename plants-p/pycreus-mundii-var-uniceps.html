<p>Pycreus mundii var. uniceps, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pycreus, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family.</p>

The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to specific regions in South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
