                    <h1>Phyllorkis apoda</h1>
<p>Phyllorkis apoda, commonly known as the leafless mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host trees for water and nutrients.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures that absorb nutrients from the host. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that are dispersed by birds. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forest canopies.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and parasitic lifestyle make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
