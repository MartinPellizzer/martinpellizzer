<p>Pyrola bracteata, commonly known as the bracted wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. Its leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Pyrola bracteata thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories.</p>
