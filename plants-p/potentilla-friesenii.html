<p>Potentilla friesenii, commonly known as the Friesen's cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a dense mat of small, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it suitable for alpine gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover.</p>
