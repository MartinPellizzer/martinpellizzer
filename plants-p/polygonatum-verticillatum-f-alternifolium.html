                    <h1>Polygonatum verticillatum f. alternifolium</h1>
<p>Polygonatum verticillatum f. alternifolium, commonly known as the alternate-leaved Solomon's seal, is a variant of the Solomon's seal plant native to parts of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive alternate arrangement of leaves, which differ from the typical whorled leaf structure of the species. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late spring, followed by red berries in the autumn. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its foliage and flowering habits make it a valuable addition to ornamental gardens and ecological landscapes.</p>
