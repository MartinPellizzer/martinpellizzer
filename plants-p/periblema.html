                    <h1>Periblema</h1>
<p>Periblema, commonly known as the outer layer of the root cap in plants, plays a crucial role in protecting the developing root tip.</p>
<p>It consists of a single layer of parenchyma cells that are responsible for sensing environmental stimuli such as gravity and moisture. The periblema also aids in the secretion of mucilage, which helps in soil adherence and nutrient absorption. This structure is essential for the root's ability to grow downward and establish itself in the soil.</p>
<p>Its cellular composition and function vary among different plant species, reflecting adaptations to diverse environmental conditions.</p>
