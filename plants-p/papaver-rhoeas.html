                <h1>Papaver rhoeas</h1>
<p>Papaver rhoeas, commonly known as the common poppy, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red petals that surround a central orange-brown capsule, which contains numerous seeds. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, and it is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>The common poppy is also known for its historical use in the production of opium, though modern cultivation focuses more on its ornamental value.</p>
