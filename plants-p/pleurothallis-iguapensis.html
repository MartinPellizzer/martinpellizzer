                    <h1>Pleurothallis iguapensis</h1>
<p>Pleurothallis iguapensis, commonly known as the Iguape River orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of dense forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without parasitizing them, and it relies on specific environmental conditions for survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
