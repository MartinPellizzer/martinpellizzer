<p>Pyrus nohelii, commonly known as the Hawaiian white pear, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is a small, deciduous tree that typically grows in moist, shaded environments on the island of Maui. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic in shape and have a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowers are white and clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to pears.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pyrus nohelii is considered critically endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
