<p>Panicum ridleyi, commonly known as Ridley's panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open woodland and grassland habitats, often in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces loose, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets. Its flowering period usually occurs during the warmer months, and it is adapted to withstand seasonal droughts.</p>
<p>The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
