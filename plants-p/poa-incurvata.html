                    <h1>Poa incurvata</h1>
<p>Poa incurvata, commonly known as bentgrass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that often curve inward. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences, typically with two to three florets per spikelet. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>Poa incurvata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in turfgrass mixes.</p>
