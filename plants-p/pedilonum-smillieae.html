<p>Pedilonum smillieae, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant has a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry conditions, and its leaves are typically narrow and succulent to reduce water loss. Pedilonum smillieae blooms during the spring and early summer, often after rainfall, and relies on pollination by insects such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited to thrive in harsh, desert environments.</p>
