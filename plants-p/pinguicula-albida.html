<p>Pinguicula albida, commonly known as the white butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wetlands. Its flowers are small and often white or pale pink, and they bloom during the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Pinguicula albida is adapted to thrive in shady conditions and requires consistent moisture for optimal growth.</p>
