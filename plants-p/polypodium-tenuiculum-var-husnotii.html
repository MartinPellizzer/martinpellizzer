                    <h1>Polypodium tenuiculum var. husnotii</h1>
<p>Polypodium tenuiculum var. husnotii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a variant of the common polypody, native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features slender, leathery fronds with a distinctive, linear shape and a serrated margin. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
