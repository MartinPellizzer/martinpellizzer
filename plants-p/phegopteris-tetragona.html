<p>Phegopteris tetragona, commonly known as the four-lobed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are divided into four lobes, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Phegopteris tetragona plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
