<p>Polystichum auriculatum var. caespitosum, commonly known as the tufted wood fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense,丛生 (clumped) growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often curled at the tips. The fronds are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long and have a leathery texture with a serrated margin. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
