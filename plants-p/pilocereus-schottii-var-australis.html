                    <h1>Pilocereus schottii var. australis</h1>
<p>Pilocereus schottii var. australis, commonly known as the Australian night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spiny plant with a sprawling habit, often forming dense mats on rocky soils. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The variety is distinguished by its slightly different growth form and flowering characteristics compared to the typical Pilocereus schottii.</p>
