<p>Piptochaetium leiopodum, commonly known as the smoothleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and savanna habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
