                    <h1>Physematium plummerae</h1>
<p>Physematium plummerae, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss.</p>
<p>Physematium plummerae plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
