<p>Piper millii, commonly known as the sacred pepper or black pepper plant, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces tiny, three-lobed berries that turn from green to red as they mature. These berries are the source of the spice black pepper, which is harvested when fully ripe.</p>
<p>Piper millii thrives in warm, humid climates and requires support for its vining growth habit.</p>
