<p>Poa naltchikensis, commonly known as the Naltchik grass, is a species of perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range.</p>
