<p>Pterostylis aspera, commonly known as the rough-leafed grass orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its leaves are rough and hairy, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common feature among orchids.</p>
