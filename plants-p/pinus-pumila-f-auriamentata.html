                    <h1>Pinus pumila f. auriamentata</h1>
<p>Pinus pumila f. auriamentata, commonly known as the golden cushion pine, is a rare and ornamental variant of the dwarf pine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts strikingly with its dark needles. This form occurs naturally in high-altitude regions of Japan, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The leaves are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical species, contributing to its cushion-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its unique coloration and ability to form compact, decorative clumps.</p>
