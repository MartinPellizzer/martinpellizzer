<p>Polylepis incana subsp.</p>
<p>icosandra, commonly known as the Andean velvet tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, silver-white to greyish foliage, which gives it a distinctive, almost woolly appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
