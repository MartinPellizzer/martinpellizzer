                    <h1>Parodia setifera var. balboaensis</h1>
<p>Parodia setifera var. balboaensis, commonly known as the Balboa prickly pear, is a cactus native to the coastal areas of Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, solitary plant with a short, cylindrical stem that often remains hidden beneath a dense layer of spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its spines are modified leaves, a characteristic adaptation to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
