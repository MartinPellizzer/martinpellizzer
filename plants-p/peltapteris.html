                    <h1>Peltapteris</h1>
<p>Peltapteris, commonly known as the "shield fern," is a genus of prehistoric plants belonging to the order Ophioglossales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, shield-shaped fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinct central vein and a series of smaller veins radiating outward. These plants thrived during the Carboniferous and Permian periods, and their fossils are often found in coal deposits. Peltapteris lacks true roots and instead has rhizomes that anchor it to the soil.</p>
<p>Its structure provides important insights into the evolution of early vascular plants and their adaptation to terrestrial environments.</p>
