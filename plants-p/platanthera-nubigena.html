<p>Platanthera nubigena, commonly known as the cloudless orchid, is a terrestrial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded woodlands in North America.</p>
<p>It features a slender, upright stem with lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip that is often tinged with purple or brown. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its ecological dependence on symbiotic relationships.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
