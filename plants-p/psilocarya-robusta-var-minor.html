<p>Psilocarya robusta var. minor, commonly known as the lesser robust psilocybe, is a species of mushroom belonging to the family Psilocybiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, conical cap that is typically pale to reddish in color, and a slender, fibrous stem. The gills are initially pale but turn a deep blue-black as the spores mature, a distinctive feature of the genus. This variety is found in forested areas, particularly in regions with moist, temperate climates.</p>
<p>It is closely related to other psilocybin-containing mushrooms and is of interest to mycologists and psychotropic researchers.</p>
