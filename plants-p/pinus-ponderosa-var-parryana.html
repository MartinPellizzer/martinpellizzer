                    <h1>Pinus ponderosa var. parryana</h1>
<p>Pinus ponderosa var. parryana, commonly known as the Parry's ponderosa pine, is a variant of the ponderosa pine native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and distinctive, flaky, reddish-bark that peels in longitudinal strips. The leaves are long, needle-like, and typically grow in clusters of two, with a bluish-green hue. It produces cones that are often larger and more robust than those of the typical ponderosa pine.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
