                    <h1>Pneumonanthe kurroo</h1>
<p>Pneumonanthe kurroo, commonly known as the Kurroo lungwort, is a rare and unusual plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, with broad, lobed leaves that resemble the structure of the human lung, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or pink in color, blooming during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or alpine soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pneumonanthe kurroo is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
