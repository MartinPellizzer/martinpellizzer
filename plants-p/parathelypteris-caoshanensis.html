                    <h1>Parathelypteris caoshanensis</h1>
<p>Parathelypteris caoshanensis, commonly known as the Caoshan water fern, is a rare fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
