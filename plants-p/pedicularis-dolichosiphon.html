<p>Pedicularis dolichosiphon, commonly known as the long-beaked lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in moist, rocky habitats. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive bilabiate shape that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is often found in the mountainous areas of Europe and western Asia.</p>
