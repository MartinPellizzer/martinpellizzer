<p>Pandanus calcicola, commonly known as the limestone pandanus, is a unique species native to the coastal regions of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or limestone soils, often near the coast or on rocky outcrops. The plant features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, which are followed by cone-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Pandanus calcicola is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range.</p>
