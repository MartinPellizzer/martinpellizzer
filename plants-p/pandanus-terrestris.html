                    <h1>Pandanus terrestris</h1>
<p>Pandanus terrestris, commonly known as the ground pandanus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 1 meter, with a dense mat of fibrous, strap-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, which eventually develop into woody, three-lobed fruits. Its leaves are often used for thatching and weaving, and the plant is adapted to thrive in sandy, coastal soils.</p>
<p>Pandanus terrestris is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes.</p>
