                    <h1>Poa beringiana</h1>
<p>Poa beringiana, commonly known as Bering's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra habitats.</p>
<p>Poa beringiana plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for local wildlife in its native range.</p>
