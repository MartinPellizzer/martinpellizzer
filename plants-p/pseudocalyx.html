                    <h1>Pseudocalyx</h1>
<p>Pseudocalyx, commonly known as the false calyx, is a botanical term used to describe a modified leaf or bract that resembles a calyx in appearance.</p>
<p>It is often found in certain flowering plants, such as those in the family Malvaceae, where it serves as a protective structure around the flower bud. Unlike a true calyx, which is composed of sepals, the pseudocalyx is derived from a leaf rather than a sepals. This structure typically persists through the flowering stage and may be mistaken for a calyx in botanical descriptions.</p>
<p>Its presence can aid in identifying certain plant species and understanding their floral morphology.</p>
