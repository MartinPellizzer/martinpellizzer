                    <h1>Pachygenium minarum</h1>
<p>Pachygenium minarum, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, adapted to pollination by wind or specialized insects. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered vulnerable to climate change and habitat loss.</p>
