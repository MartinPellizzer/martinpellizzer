<p>Pingraea nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves with distinct, parallel veins that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
