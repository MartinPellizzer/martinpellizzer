                    <h1>Plectronia neilgherrensis var. chartacea</h1>
<p>Plectronia neilgherrensis var. chartacea, commonly known as the chartaceous plectronia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely textured, papery leaves that give it its common name, and its small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in montane forests and alpine meadows. It has a limited geographic distribution and is considered a species of conservation concern due to habitat loss and climate change.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and restricted range make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
