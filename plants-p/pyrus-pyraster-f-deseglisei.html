                    <h1>Pyrus pyraster f. deseglisei</h1>
<p>Pyrus pyraster f. deseglisei, commonly known as the Deseglise's whitebeam, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the whitebeam tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost white leaves that contrast with its dark, textured bark. This form is typically smaller than the typical species, with a more compact and bushy growth habit. The leaves are often lobed and have a unique, almost silvery appearance due to their dense, fine pubescence.</p>
<p>It is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value and is found in botanical gardens and specialized collections.</p>
