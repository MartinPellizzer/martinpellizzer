                            <h1>Panicum Vaginatum</h1>
<p>Panic grass, scientifically known as Panicum vaginatum, is a hardy perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is recognized for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and environmental conditions. This plant is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. With its tall, slender stalks and delicate, feathery plumes, it adds a graceful touch to natural landscapes. Panic grass plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
