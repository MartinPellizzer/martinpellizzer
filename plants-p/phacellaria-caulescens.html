<p>Phacellaria caulescens, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are thin and often have a bladdery appearance, which may aid in buoyancy.</p>
<p>Phacellaria caulescens is a carnivorous plant, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic organisms to supplement its nutrient intake.</p>
