<p>Pingraea viscosa, commonly known as sticky pingraea, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give the plant a sticky texture, which is a key botanical feature. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and it has a woody stem with a fibrous structure. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in the same sticky substance, contributing to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Pingraea viscosa is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
