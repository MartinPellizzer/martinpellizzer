<p>Petrosedum rupestre var. forsterianum, commonly known as the Forster's stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>
