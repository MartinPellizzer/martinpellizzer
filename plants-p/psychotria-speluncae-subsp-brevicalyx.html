<p>Psychotria speluncae subsp.</p>
<p>brevicalyx, commonly known as the cave psychotria, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the humid tropical caves of Southeast Asia. It is a small shrub characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in the cool, moist, and dimly lit environments of cave systems, where it has adapted to low light conditions. Its growth is closely tied to the unique microclimatic conditions found within these subterranean habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and environmental changes.</p>
