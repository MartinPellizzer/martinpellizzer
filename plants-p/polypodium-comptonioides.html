The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Polypodium comptonioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
