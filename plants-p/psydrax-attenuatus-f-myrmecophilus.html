                    <h1>Psydrax attenuatus f. myrmecophilus</h1>
<p>Psydrax attenuatus f. myrmecophilus, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a unique species within the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its specialized structures called domatia, which provide shelter for ants. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and help in nutrient cycling. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship with specific ant species, which is a key feature of its ecological role.</p>
<p>Its morphology includes a woody stem with lanceolate leaves and small, clustered flowers.</p>
