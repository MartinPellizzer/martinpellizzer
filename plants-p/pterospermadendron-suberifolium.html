                    <h1>Pterospermadendron suberifolium</h1>
<p>Pterospermadendron suberifolium, commonly known as the thickleaf pterospermum, is a member of the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with four petals, typically in shades of white or pink. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
