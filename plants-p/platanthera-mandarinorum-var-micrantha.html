                    <h1>Platanthera mandarinorum var. micrantha</h1>
<p>Platanthera mandarinorum var. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the wetlands of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological dependence on symbiotic relationships. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in peat bogs and marshy areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
