                    <h1>Pelma absconditum</h1>
<p>Pelma absconditum, commonly known as the hidden mist fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant found in the dense, misty forests of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, silver-gray fronds that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help it retain moisture in its humid environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore capsules that are often hidden among its foliage, making it difficult to detect. It thrives in shaded, nutrient-rich soil and is highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Pelma absconditum is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
