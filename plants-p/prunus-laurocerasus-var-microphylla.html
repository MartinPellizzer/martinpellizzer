                    <h1>Prunus laurocerasus var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Prunus laurocerasus var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf cherry laurel, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the western Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, giving it a dense, lush appearance. The plant produces small white flowers in spring, which are followed by dark purple berries that are edible but often used as ornamental features. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for hedging and landscape design.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and tolerance to pruning make it suitable for shaping into topiaries or formal garden structures.</p>
