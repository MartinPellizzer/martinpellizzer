<p>Poa foliosa var. tennantiana, commonly known as the Tennant's bentgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, often arching stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its delicate appearance and ecological role in stabilizing soil make it an important component of native New Zealand ecosystems.</p>
