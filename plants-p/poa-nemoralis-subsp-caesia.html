<p>Poa nemoralis subsp.</p>
<p>caesia, commonly known as blue mountain bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in woodland and heathland habitats, often growing in association with other shade-tolerant flora.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
