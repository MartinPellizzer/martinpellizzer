<p>Phegopteris poeppigii, commonly known as the broadleaf huperzia, is a fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its tall, erect fronds with a distinctive, broad, and leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Phegopteris poeppigii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
