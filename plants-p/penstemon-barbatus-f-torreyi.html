<p>Penstemon barbatus f. torreyi, commonly known as Torrey's beardplant, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>

The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is a valuable plant for pollinators, particularly hummingbirds and bees, due to its nectar-rich flowers.</p>
