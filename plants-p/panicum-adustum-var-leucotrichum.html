                    <h1>Panicum adustum var. leucotrichum</h1>
<p>Panicum adustum var. leucotrichum, commonly known as silver panicum, is a variant of the panic grass genus characterized by its distinctive silvery foliage.</p>
<p>It is a warm-season grass that thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairie and open woodland habitats. The plant produces fluffy, seed-filled spikelets that give it a soft, cloud-like appearance, especially when mature. Its foliage is covered in fine, silver-white hairs, which give it a striking visual contrast against green or brown backgrounds.</p>
<p>This ornamental grass is popular in landscaping for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
