<p>Polystichum × takaosanense, commonly known as the Takaosan bracken, is a hybrid fern native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polystichum × takaosanense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its dense, upright growth habit.</p>
