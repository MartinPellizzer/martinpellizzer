                    <h1>Paederia scandens var. maritima</h1>
<p>Paederia scandens var. maritima, commonly known as coastal paederia, is a climbing vine native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are often hairy and adapted to saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, round, fleshy fruits. It thrives in sandy or muddy soils along shorelines and is often found in tidal zones.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate salt spray and periodic flooding makes it an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
