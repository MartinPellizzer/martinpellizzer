<p>Panicum heterochlamys, commonly known as the variable panic grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and inflorescence that consists of spikelets with both palea and lemma. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a slightly hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in hot environments.</p>
<p>Panicum heterochlamys is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for forage or as a ornamental plant.</p>
