<p>Polypodium lesourdianum, commonly known as the Lesourd's cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a rosette formation. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its propagation in suitable microhabitats.</p>
