                    <h1>Polygonum aviculare subvar. denudatum</h1>
<p>Polygonum aviculare subvar. denudatum, commonly known as the slender knotweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems.</p>
<p>It features small, opposite leaves that are often reddish or purplish in color, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides and wet meadows.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its reduced leaf hairs and shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other Polygonum species.</p>
