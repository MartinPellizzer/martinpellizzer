<p>Polypodium planiusculum, commonly known as the flat-leaf holly fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of forests. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are usually darker in color than the sterile ones.</p>
<p>Polypodium planiusculum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to add a lush, tropical feel to shaded garden spaces.</p>
