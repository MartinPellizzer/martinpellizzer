<p>Polygonum thunbergii, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread rapidly and form dense stands. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish on the underside, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. It is often found in moist environments such as stream banks and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
