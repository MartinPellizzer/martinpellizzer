                    <h1>Pteridium centrali-africanum</h1>
<p>Pteridium centrali-africanum, commonly known as the African bracken, is a fern native to central Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy and ecological role in the region.</p>
