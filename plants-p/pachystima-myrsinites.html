                    <h1>Pachystima myrsinites</h1>
<p>Pachystima myrsinites, commonly known as silver cholla, is a perennial cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny clusters of cylindrical stems that are covered in a silvery, powdery coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red fruits containing seeds. It has adapted to arid environments with its succulent stems that store water and its reduced leaves that minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Pachystima myrsinites is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
