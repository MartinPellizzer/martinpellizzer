<p>Pterocephalus pulverulentus, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access underground water. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
