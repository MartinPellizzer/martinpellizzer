<p>Pyrrosia serpens, commonly known as the serpent fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocky surfaces.</p>
<p>Pyrrosia serpens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
