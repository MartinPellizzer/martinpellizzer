                    <h1>Paralychnophora bicolor</h1>
<p>Paralychnophora bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored parasitic orchid, is a unique flowering plant that exhibits a specialized parasitic relationship with its host.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking bi-colored flowers, typically featuring contrasting hues of white and purple. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it an obligate parasite. Its small, intricate flowers are adapted for specific pollinators, contributing to its ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in isolated, humid environments.</p>
