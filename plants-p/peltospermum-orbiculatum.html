                    <h1>Peltospermum orbiculatum</h1>
<p>Peltospermum orbiculatum, commonly known as the orbiculate peltosperm, is a rare and ancient flowering plant belonging to the family Peltospermataceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, orbicular (rounded) seeds and is notable for its primitive floral structure, which provides insights into early angiosperm evolution. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually alternate and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research.</p>
