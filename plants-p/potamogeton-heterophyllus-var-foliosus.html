                    <h1>Potamogeton heterophyllus var. foliosus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton heterophyllus var. foliosus, commonly known as the variable pondweed, is a freshwater aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its morphological variation, with leaves that can be either filamentous or broad and strap-like depending on water depth. The plant typically grows in shallow to moderately deep water, often in lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The species is often found in nutrient-rich environments and can form dense stands that affect water flow and light penetration.</p>
