                    <h1>Poa fendleriana var. arida</h1>
<p>Poa fendleriana var. arida, commonly known as the desert bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage that reflects sunlight, helping it withstand harsh desert conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which are adapted for pollination by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and restoration projects.</p>
