                    <h1>Phyllodes blanda</h1>
<p>Phyllodes blanda, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, linear phyllodes that resemble leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It has a fibrous root system and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The phyllodes are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and provide some protection against herbivory.</p>
