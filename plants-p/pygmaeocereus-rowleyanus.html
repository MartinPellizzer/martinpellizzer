<p>Pygmaeocereus rowleyanus, commonly known as the elephant's foot cactus, is a unique succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly stems that form a compact, rounded shape resembling an elephant's foot. The plant produces white, star-shaped flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Despite its slow growth, it is a popular ornamental plant due to its distinctive appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
