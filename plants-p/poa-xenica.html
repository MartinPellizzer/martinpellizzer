                    <h1>Poa xenica</h1>
<p>Poa xenica, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa xenica thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate harsh conditions makes it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
