                    <h1>Pedicularis pantlingii var. typica</h1>
<p>Pedicularis pantlingii var. typica, commonly known as the Yellow Monkey Orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>This rare and ornamental species is often cultivated for its unique appearance and ecological significance in mountain ecosystems.</p>
