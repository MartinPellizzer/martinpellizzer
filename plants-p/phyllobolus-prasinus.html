                    <h1>Phyllobolus prasinus</h1>
<p>Phyllobolus prasinus, commonly known as the green leaf blister, is a species of rust fungus that primarily infects grasses.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow to orange pustules that appear on the leaves of its host plants. The fungus produces spores in the form of uredia, which are essential for its life cycle and spread. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and is often found in agricultural areas where grasses are cultivated.</p>
<p>The plant's infection can lead to reduced growth and yield in affected grass species.</p>
