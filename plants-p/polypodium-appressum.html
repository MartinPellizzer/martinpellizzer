<p>Polypodium appressum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water bodies. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>The fronds are evergreen and remain green throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value in humid climates.</p>
