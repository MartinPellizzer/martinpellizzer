<p>Pinguicula jorgehintonii, commonly known as Hinton's butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap small insects. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its unique trapping mechanism and specialized morphology make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
