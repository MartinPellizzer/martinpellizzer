                    <h1>Phoradendron serotinum var. macrophyllum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron serotinum var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its specialized stems that penetrate the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are broad and glossy, and it is often found in forest canopies.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting bird populations and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
