                    <h1>Pabstiella truncatilabia</h1>
<p>Pabstiella truncatilabia, commonly known as the narrow-lipped pabstiella, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and unique floral morphology. The plant produces small, showy flowers with a distinctive truncation at the base of the lip, which is a key identifying feature. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or paramo ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pabstiella truncatilabia is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
