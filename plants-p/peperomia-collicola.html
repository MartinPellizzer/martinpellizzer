                    <h1>Peperomia collicola</h1>
<p>Peperomia collicola, commonly known as the rock peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens.</p>
