                    <h1>Patabea coriacea</h1>
<p>Patabea coriacea, commonly known as the rough patabea, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its often arid or semi-arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and it is known for its aromatic foliage. Patabea coriacea is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
