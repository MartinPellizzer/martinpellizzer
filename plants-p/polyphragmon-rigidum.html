<p>Polyphragmon rigidum, commonly known as the rigid thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and rosette-like arrangement of leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Polyphragmon rigidum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
