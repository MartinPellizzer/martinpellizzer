<p>Phyllanthus dingleri, commonly known as the desert dudleya, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its root system is shallow and adapted to quickly absorb rainwater, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Phyllanthus dingleri is often found growing on rocky slopes and in crevices, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
