                    <h1>Pyrus malus proles dasyphylla</h1>
<p>Pyrus malus proles dasyphylla, commonly known as the roughleaf apple, is a lesser-known variant of the apple tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive rough, scaly bark and broad, ovate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, tart apples in the fall. It is native to certain regions of Asia and is often grown for its ornamental value as well as its fruit.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, it is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists and horticulturists.</p>
