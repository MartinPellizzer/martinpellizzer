                    <h1>Polybotrya pittieri</h1>
<p>Polybotrya pittieri, commonly known as the Pittier's clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on the forest floor. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in small, club-shaped formations along the stems. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists studying ancient plant lineages and forest ecosystems.</p>
