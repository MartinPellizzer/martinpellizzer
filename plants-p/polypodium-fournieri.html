<p>Polypodium fournieri, commonly known as the Fournier's water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky surfaces or soil.</p>
<p>The spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
