                            <h1>Potentilla Opaca F. Serotina</h1>
<p>Shadbush, scientifically known as Potentilla opaca f. serotina, is a rare and distinctive shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring, often around the time of the shad fish run, hence its common name. The plant thrives in moist, wooded habitats and is often found in swampy areas along riverbanks. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered in many regions. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique and ecologically important species.</p>
