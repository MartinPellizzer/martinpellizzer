                <h1>Pichisermollia nigrovenia</h1>
<p>Pichisermollia nigrovenia, commonly known as the black-veined pichisermollia, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves with prominent black veins, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically between October and February. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or humus-rich soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
