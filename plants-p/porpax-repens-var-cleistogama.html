                    <h1>Porpax repens var. cleistogama</h1>
<p>Porpax repens var. cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous prostrate porpax, is a flowering plant characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit.</p>
<p>It produces both open and closed (cleistogamous) flowers, a reproductive strategy that enhances seed production in less favorable conditions. The plant typically features small, greenish-white flowers that are often hidden within the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique reproductive adaptations and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
