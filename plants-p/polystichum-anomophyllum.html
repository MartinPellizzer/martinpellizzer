<p>Polystichum anomophyllum, commonly known as the variable fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive variation in the size and shape of its pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Polystichum anomophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, evergreen foliage.</p>
