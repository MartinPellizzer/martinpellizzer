                    <h1>Psydrax attenuatus f. megalanthus</h1>
<p>Psydrax attenuatus f. megalanthus, commonly known as the large-flowered psidium, is a variant of the psidium genus native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its notably larger flowers compared to the typical species, with showy white to pale pink blooms. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its fruits are generally small, round, and edible, though less commonly cultivated than other psidium species.</p>
<p>The botanical interest of this form lies in its floral morphology and potential horticultural value.</p>
