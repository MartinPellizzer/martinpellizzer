                    <h1>Polystichum muscicola</h1>
<p>Polystichum muscicola, commonly known as the mossy fern, is a species of dryopterid fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are densely covered with fine, moss-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, helping it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in compact, club-shaped sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds.</p>
