<p>Psychotria exserta, commonly known as the "Cocaine Plant," is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the alkaloid cocaine, which is extracted from the leaves. Psychotria exserta thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its psychoactive properties, it is both ecologically significant and subject to legal restrictions in many regions.</p>
