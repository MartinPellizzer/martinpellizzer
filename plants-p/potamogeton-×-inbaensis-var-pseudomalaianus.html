<p>Potamogeton × inbaensis var. pseudomalaianus, commonly known as the Malayan pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant characterized by its submerged foliage and elongated, ribbon-like leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes, where it forms dense mats on the bottom. The plant exhibits a complex morphology, with leaves that are often arranged in whorls and possess a smooth, glossy surface. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for water pollination.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its genetic diversity and ecological adaptability, making it an important species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
