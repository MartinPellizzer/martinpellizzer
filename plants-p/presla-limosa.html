                <h1>Presla limosa</h1>
<p>Presla limosa, commonly known as the marsh saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland habitat.</p>
<p>Presla limosa is often found in regions with temperate climates and is adapted to fluctuating water levels.</p>
