<p>Pipturus repandus var. mollissimus, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a striking plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it a soft, almost silvery appearance. The plant has a unique growth habit, forming a low, mat-like structure that covers the ground. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its distinctive visual appeal.</p>
