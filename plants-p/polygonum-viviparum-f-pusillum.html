                    <h1>Polygonum viviparum f. pusillum</h1>
<p>Polygonum viviparum f. pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, upright growth habit and clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent and sometimes invasive species in its native habitat.</p>
