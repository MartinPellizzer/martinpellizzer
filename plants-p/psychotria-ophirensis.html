<p>Psychotria ophirensis, commonly known as the Ayahuasca vine, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical rainforests of South America, particularly in regions of the Amazon Basin. The plant contains various psychoactive alkaloids, most notably dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which contributes to its traditional use in shamanic rituals.
