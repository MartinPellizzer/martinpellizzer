<p>Picea excelsa var. parviformis, commonly known as the dwarf white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen conifer with a conical shape and dense, dark green foliage. The leaves are typically short and needle-like, with a slightly twisted appearance. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to harsh mountain environments, tolerating cold temperatures and poor soil conditions.</p>
