                    <h1>Plettkea</h1>
<p>Plettkea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers that bloom on a single stem. The plant lacks leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, making it a mycoheterotroph, dependent on symbiotic relationships with fungi. Plettkea thrives in wet, acidic pine flatwoods and is often found growing on the trunks of trees.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is listed as endangered in several states.</p>
