                    <h1>Pleuricospora</h1>
<p>Pleuricospora, commonly known as the "false broomrape," is a genus of parasitic plants belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>These plants lack true leaves and chlorophyll, relying entirely on host plants for nutrients. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. The seeds of Pleuricospora are minute and can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
<p>Due to their parasitic nature, they can significantly impact the growth and health of their host plants.</p>
