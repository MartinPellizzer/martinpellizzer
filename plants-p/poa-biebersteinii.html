                    <h1>Poa biebersteinii</h1>
<p>Poa biebersteinii, commonly known as the Tibetan bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and adjacent areas of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it tolerates cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Its small, spike-like inflorescence consists of numerous short, compact spikelets.</p>
<p>Poa biebersteinii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
