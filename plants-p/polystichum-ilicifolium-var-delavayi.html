                    <h1>Polystichum ilicifolium var. delavayi</h1>
<p>Polystichum ilicifolium var. delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's wood fern, is a variant of the broadleaf wood fern native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, shield-like structure called an indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
