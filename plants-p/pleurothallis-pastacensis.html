                    <h1>Pleurothallis pastacensis</h1>
<p>Pleurothallis pastacensis, commonly known as the Pastac√©n orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
