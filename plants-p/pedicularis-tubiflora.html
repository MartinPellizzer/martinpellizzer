                    <h1>Pedicularis tubiflora</h1>
<p>Pedicularis tubiflora, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It thrives in alpine environments and is often found in rocky or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticulture.</p>
