                    <h1>Potentilla inclinata var. canescens</h1>
<p>Potentilla inclinata var. canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, typically clustered in inflorescences at the tips of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
