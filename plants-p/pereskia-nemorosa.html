                    <h1>Pereskia nemorosa</h1>
<p>Pereskia nemorosa, commonly known as the tree cactus or green cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, woody stems that are covered in a layer of green, leaf-like structures. Unlike typical cacti, it produces true leaves, which are broad and succulent, allowing it to photosynthesize efficiently. The plant also features spiny areoles, typical of cacti, and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening.</p>
<p>Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
