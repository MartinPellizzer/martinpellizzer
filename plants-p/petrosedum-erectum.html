                    <h1>Petrosedum erectum</h1>
<p>Petrosedum erectum, commonly known as the upright stonecress, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky habitats in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with fleshy, upright stems covered in small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, rounded berries. Its succulent leaves are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid or rocky environments.</p>
<p>Petrosedum erectum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
