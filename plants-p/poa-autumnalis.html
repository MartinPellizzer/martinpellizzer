                    <h1>Poa autumnalis</h1>
<p>Poa autumnalis, commonly known as autumn bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has fine, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Poa autumnalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant landscapes.</p>
