                    <h1>Potentilla nivea var. hookeriana</h1>
<p>Potentilla nivea var. hookeriana, commonly known as the Hooker's silverweed, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-white, woolly foliage that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates.</p>
