                    <h1>Polypodium amoenum var. tonglense</h1>
<p>Polypodium amoenum var. tonglense, commonly known as the Tongling water fern, is a rare variant of the water fern family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically borne on long, creeping rhizomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological traits.</p>
