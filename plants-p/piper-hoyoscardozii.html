<p>Piper hoyoscardozii, commonly known as the Hoyoscardozii pepper, is a rare and little-studied species native to the cloud forests of Panama.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Piper genus, which includes many economically important spices such as black pepper. The plant is characterized by its woody vines and heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are followed by berries that turn red when mature.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
