                    <h1>Pteris palustris</h1>
<p>Pteris palustris, commonly known as the marsh holly fern, is a species of fern native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It has feather-like fronds that are divided into small, lance-shaped pinnae, giving it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found near streams, ponds, and wet meadows. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Pteris palustris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions.</p>
