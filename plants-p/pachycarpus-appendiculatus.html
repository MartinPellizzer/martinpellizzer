                    <h1>Pachycarpus appendiculatus</h1>
<p>Pachycarpus appendiculatus, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Pachycarpus appendiculatus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
