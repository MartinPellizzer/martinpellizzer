                    <h1>Panicum limnaeum</h1>
<p>Panicum limnaeum, commonly known as water panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels.</p>
