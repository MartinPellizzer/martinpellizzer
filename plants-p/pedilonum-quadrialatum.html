<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and four-winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. The plant has succulent leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it an interesting subject for botanical study in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
