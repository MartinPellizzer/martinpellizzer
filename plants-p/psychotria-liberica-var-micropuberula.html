                    <h1>Psychotria liberica var. micropuberula</h1>
<p>Psychotria liberica var. micropuberula, commonly known as the micropuberula Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Colombia. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a fine, short pubescence. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its morphological differences from the typical *Psychotria liberica*, including its smaller leaf size and distinct pubescence pattern.</p>
