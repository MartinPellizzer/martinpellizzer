<p>Pseudolobivia potosina, commonly known as the Potosi lobivia, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Pseudolobivia potosina is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
