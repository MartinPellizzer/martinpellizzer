                    <h1>Pitcairnia meridensis</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia meridensis, commonly known as the Andean pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a common adaptation in its humid, high-altitude habitat. The plant produces striking inflorescences with showy, violet flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are often covered in fine trichomes, which help reduce water loss in the misty environment.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia meridensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique botanical features.</p>
