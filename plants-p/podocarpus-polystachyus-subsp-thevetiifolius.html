<p>Podocarpus polystachyus subsp.</p>
<p>thevetiifolius, commonly known as the Indian tea tree or thevetia, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or lanceolate in shape.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that contain seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
