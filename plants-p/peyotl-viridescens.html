                    <h1>Peyotl viridescens</h1>
<p>Peyotl viridescens, commonly known as the yellow peyote, is a small cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spineless stems that are typically bright yellow to green in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing black seeds. Peyotl viridescens contains the psychoactive compound mescaline, which has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for spiritual and ceremonial purposes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it distinct from the more commonly known species of peyote, Peyote (Lophophora williamsii).</p>
