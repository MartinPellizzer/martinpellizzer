                    <h1>Poa bulbillifera</h1>
<p>Poa bulbillifera, commonly known as the bulbous bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairless stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences, with each spikelet containing a single floret that develops into a bulbil, a vegetative reproduction structure. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and slightly hairy, typically ranging from 5 to 15 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>Poa bulbillifera is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
