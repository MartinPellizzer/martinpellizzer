                    <h1>Platanthera grandiflora</h1>
<p>Platanthera grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has reduced leaves called bracts, which are often mistaken for leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands.</p>
<p>Platanthera grandiflora is a rhizomatous plant, meaning it spreads through underground stems, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
