                    <h1>Potentilla tormentilla subsp. silvestris</h1>
<p>Potentilla tormentilla subsp.</p>
<p>silvestris, commonly known as Silverside cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its silver-white undersides on the leaves, which give it its common name, and its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It has a compact growth habit with multiple stems and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and geographic distribution compared to other Potentilla species.</p>
