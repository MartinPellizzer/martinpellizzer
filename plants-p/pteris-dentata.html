<p>Pteris dentata, commonly known as the serrated holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are finely serrated along the edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Pteris dentata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
