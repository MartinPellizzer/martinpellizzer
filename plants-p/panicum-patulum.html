<p>Panicum patulum, commonly known as the broadleaf panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and wide, flat leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, Panicum patulum is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
