                    <h1>Platanus × hybrida</h1>
<p>Platanus × hybrida, commonly known as the London plane tree, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) and the Oriental sycamore (Platanus orientalis).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive mottled bark that peels in a papery manner, giving it a unique appearance. The tree produces large, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. It is a fast-growing, deciduous tree that thrives in urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compacted soils.</p>
<p>The London plane tree is widely planted as an ornamental and for its shade-providing capabilities in cities.</p>
