<p>Pteris angustipinnula, commonly known as the narrow-pinnule maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and conservation efforts.</p>
