                    <h1>Paeonia peregrina proles leiocarpa</h1>
<p>Paeonia peregrina proles leiocarpa, commonly known as the white peony, is a rare and striking member of the芍药科 (Paeoniaceae) family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, white, single blooms that resemble roses, with finely divided, fern-like leaves. Native to the mountainous regions of central Asia, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its flowers typically appear in late spring to early summer, and it is noted for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
<p>However, due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
