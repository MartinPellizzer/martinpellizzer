                    <h1>Polypodium heterophlebium</h1>
<p>Polypodium heterophlebium, commonly known as the variable spleenwort, is a fern species native to various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its morphological variability, which can make identification challenging without careful examination.</p>
