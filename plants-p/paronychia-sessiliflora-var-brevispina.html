                    <h1>Paronychia sessiliflora var. brevispina</h1>
<p>Paronychia sessiliflora var. brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
