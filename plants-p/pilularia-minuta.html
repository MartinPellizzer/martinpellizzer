<p>Pilularia minuta, commonly known as the dwarf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient absorption. This plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Pilularia minuta is a rootless plant, relying on its specialized structures for buoyancy and nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Its presence often indicates clean, well-oxygenated water conditions.</p>
