                    <h1>Polygala arillata f. kachinensis</h1>
<p>Polygala arillata f. kachinensis, commonly known as the Kachin polygala, is a rare and distinctive member of the Polygalaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, often pink or purple flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in Myanmar, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, seed-like structures called mericarps.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
