                    <h1>Paspalum polyneuron</h1>
<p>Paspalum polyneuron, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments and salt marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is drought-tolerant and salt-resistant, making it well-suited for coastal restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize sand dunes helps prevent erosion and supports local biodiversity.</p>
