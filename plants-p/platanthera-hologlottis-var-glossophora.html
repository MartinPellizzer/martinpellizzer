                    <h1>Platanthera hologlottis var. glossophora</h1>
<p>Platanthera hologlottis var. glossophora, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinkish-purple pouch-shaped flower, which is adapted to attract specific pollinators, primarily bees and moths. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires a specific mycorrhizal association for nutrient uptake. It has thin, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
