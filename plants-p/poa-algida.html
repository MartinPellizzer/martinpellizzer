                    <h1>Poa algida</h1>
<p>Poa algida, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Poa algida plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for alpine wildlife.</p>
