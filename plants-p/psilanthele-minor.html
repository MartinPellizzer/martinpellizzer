                    <h1>Psilanthele minor</h1>
<p>Psilanthele minor, commonly known as the lesser sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe, where it often grows in coastal or dry, open habitats. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid conditions, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters. It is a perennial species that produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize disturbed soils, it is often found in areas with minimal vegetation.</p>
