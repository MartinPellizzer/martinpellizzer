<p>Platanthera bifolia subsp.</p>
<p>subalpina, commonly known as the alpine lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species characterized by its delicate, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a loose, spiraling inflorescence. It typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky areas, preferring cool, moist environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>The plant has elongated, strap-like leaves and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. It is found in the Alps and other mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
