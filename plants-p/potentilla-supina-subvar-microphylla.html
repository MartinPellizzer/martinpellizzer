<p>Potentilla supina subvar. microphylla, commonly known as the prostrate cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length, arranged in a dense, mat-like growth pattern. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in heads and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its compact form and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens as a ground cover.</p>
