                    <h1>Polemonium brandegeei f. lambornii</h1>
<p>Polemonium brandegeei f. lambornii, commonly known as the Lamborn's Jacob's ladder, is a rare and striking herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polemoniaceae family and is characterized by its cascading clusters of bell-shaped, lavender-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often tinged with reddish hues. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a desirable addition to woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions.</p>
