<p>Pellaea lozanoi, commonly known as the Lozano's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Pellaea lozanoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
