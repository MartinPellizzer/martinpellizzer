<p>Pachyphyllum vaginatum, commonly known as the desert rose or false rose, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Pachyphyllum vaginatum is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
