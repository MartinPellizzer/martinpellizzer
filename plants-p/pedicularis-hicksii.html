<p>Pedicularis hicksii, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its roots. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive hooded structure that aids in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Pedicularis hicksii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
