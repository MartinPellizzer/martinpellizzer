<p>Pellaea mucronata subsp.</p>
<p>californica, commonly known as the California mountain holly, is a perennial fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, upright growth habit.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups known as sorangia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat.</p>
