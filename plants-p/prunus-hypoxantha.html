                    <h1>Prunus hypoxantha</h1>
<p>Prunus hypoxantha, commonly known as the desert almond, is a small, deciduous shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, hairy fruits known as drupes. Prunus hypoxantha is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems and a subject of interest in ecological and horticultural studies.</p>
