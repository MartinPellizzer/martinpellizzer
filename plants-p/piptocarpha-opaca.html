<p>Piptocarpha opaca, commonly known as desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
