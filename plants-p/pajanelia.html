                    <h1>Pajanelia</h1>
<p>Pajanelia, commonly known as the "buttercup flower," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Ranunculaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their showy, often bright yellow or orange petals that resemble those of the buttercup. Pajanelia species typically have simple, palmately lobed leaves and produce small, greenish flowers that bloom in early spring. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they can be toxic to livestock and humans.</p>
