<p>Psephellus erivanensis subsp.</p>
<p>erivanensis, commonly known as the Erivan sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It typically features a compact rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
