                    <h1>Phyllactis sedifolia</h1>
<p>Phyllactis sedifolia, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often covered in a dense, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss and provides protection.</p>
<p>Phyllactis sedifolia is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the digestion of prey for survival.</p>
