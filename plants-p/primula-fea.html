                    <h1>Primula fea</h1>
<p>Primula fea, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop, and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are generally dark green, rough to the touch, and have a slightly waxy appearance.</p>
<p>Primula fea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, rocky garden settings.</p>
