<p>Polypodium lebeufii, commonly known as the cliff brake, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into two parts, with the upper portion being more deeply lobed. The plant thrives in rocky, limestone-rich soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in shaded, moist environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium lebeufii is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that plays an important role in its native ecosystem.</p>
