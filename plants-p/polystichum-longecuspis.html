<p>Polystichum longecuspis, commonly known as the long-awned wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with finely divided pinnae that give the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
