<p>Pontederia limosa, commonly known as purple rush, is a herbaceous wetland plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green with a waxy coating. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in dense spikes, often in late summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
