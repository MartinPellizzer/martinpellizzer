                    <h1>Polevansia rigida</h1>
<p>Polevansia rigida, commonly known as the rigid polevansia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features upright, rigid stems that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to minimize surface area and conserve moisture.</p>
<p>Polevansia rigida is often found growing in rocky soils or along dry riverbeds, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
