<p>Plumatichilos unicornis, commonly known as the unicorn orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, single flower that resembles a unicorn's horn, giving it its common name. The plant has a compact, pseudobulbous structure with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are typically pink or purple and are highly fragrant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and specialized growing conditions, Plumatichilos unicornis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
