                    <h1>Phyllocytisus sessilifolius</h1>
<p>Phyllocytisus sessilifolius, commonly known as the sessile-leaved buckthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, elliptical leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they lack stalks. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, which are followed by small, dark berries. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions.</p>
