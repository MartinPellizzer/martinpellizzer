                    <h1>Pentaphylloides phyllocalyx</h1>
<p>Pentaphylloides phyllocalyx, commonly known as the broad-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves that are typically broad and ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are often consumed by birds. It is native to regions of South America and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
