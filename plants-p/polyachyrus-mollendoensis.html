<p>Polyachyrus mollendoensis, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a combination of white, purple, and green hues. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or forested areas. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin, nutrient-poor soils of its habitat.</p>
<p>The orchid plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystem, contributing to biodiversity and serving as a food source for certain pollinators.</p>
