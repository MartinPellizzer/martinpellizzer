                    <h1>Phacelia biolettii</h1>
<p>Phacelia biolettii, commonly known as the desert phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes, where it has adapted to harsh conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss, while its root system is deep, allowing it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Phacelia biolettii plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardiness.</p>
