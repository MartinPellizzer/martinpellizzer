                    <h1>Paloue</h1>
<p>Paloue, commonly known as *Pteris multifida*, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often divided into numerous narrow segments. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, paloue thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant's rhizomes are creeping and produce new growth from the base, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening.</p>
