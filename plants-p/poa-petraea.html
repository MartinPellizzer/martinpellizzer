                    <h1>Poa petraea</h1>
<p>Poa petraea, commonly known as the rock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often blue-green leaves that are adapted to thrive in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Poa petraea is often found in alpine or subalpine regions, where it contributes to the formation of meadows and stabilizes soil in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
