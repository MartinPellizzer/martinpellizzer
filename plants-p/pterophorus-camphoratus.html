                    <h1>Pterophorus camphoratus</h1>
<p>Pterophorus camphoratus, commonly known as the camphor tree leaf miner, is a small moth species belonging to the family Pterophoridae.</p>
<p>It is primarily associated with the camphor tree (Cinnamomum camphora), where its larvae feed on the leaves, creating distinctive mine patterns. The adult moths are characterized by their delicate, narrow wings that are often patterned with intricate veins and colors. The plant's leaves provide both a habitat and a food source for the larvae, making it an important host plant in the life cycle of this species.</p>
<p>This relationship highlights the ecological significance of the camphor tree in supporting specific insect populations.</p>
