<p>Paepalanthus diffusus, commonly known as the spreading pincushion cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus characterized by its dense, spiny stems that resemble a pincushion. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping in regions with dry climates.</p>
