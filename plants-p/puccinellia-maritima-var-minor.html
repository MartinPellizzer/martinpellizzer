                    <h1>Puccinellia maritima var. minor</h1>
<p>Puccinellia maritima var. minor, commonly known as saltmeadow cordgrass, is a halophytic grass species adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal marshes and tidal flats, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and reducing erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding, making it an important component of estuarine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
