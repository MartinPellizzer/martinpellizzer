                    <h1>Pedicularis bracteosa var. montanensis</h1>
<p>Pedicularis bracteosa var. montanensis, commonly known as the alpine lousewort, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it derives some nutrients from its host plants while performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually red or orange, with a distinctive spurred structure that attracts pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
