<p>Polygala bocainensis var. limnophila, commonly known as the water polygala, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific wetland habitats in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, often blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils near water bodies such as lakes and rivers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
