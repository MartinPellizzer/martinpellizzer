                    <h1>Polypodium lobatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium lobatum, commonly known as the rock fern or shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Asia, particularly China, Japan, and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments, where it forms dense colonies. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and establish itself in challenging terrain.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive shield-shaped base that gives the plant its common name.</p>
