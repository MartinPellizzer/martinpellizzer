                    <h1>Polypodium durum</h1>
<p>Polypodium durum, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a species of fern native to various regions in the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a tight, clustered pattern. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in shaded, humid environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium durum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy, low-maintenance nature.</p>
