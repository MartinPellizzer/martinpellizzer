                    <h1>Poa nigricans</h1>
<p>Poa nigricans, commonly known as black bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, dark green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread vegetatively, making it resilient in disturbed or marginal habitats.</p>
<p>Poa nigricans is often found in alpine, coastal, or dry environments where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
