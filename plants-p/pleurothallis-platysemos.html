<p>Pleurothallis platysemos, commonly known as the flat-septate pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and relatively small, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically pale green to white, with a subtle fragrance, and are arranged in racemes along the stems. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated as a houseplant in controlled conditions.</p>
