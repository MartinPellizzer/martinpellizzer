                <h1>Pyrus calleryana</h1>
<p>Pyrus calleryana, commonly known as the Chinese white ash or Callery pear, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces small, edible pomes that are typically not consumed by humans but are important for wildlife. It is often cultivated as an ornamental tree due to its fast growth and showy blossoms.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native species.</p>
