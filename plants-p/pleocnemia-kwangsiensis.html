<p>Pleocnemia kwangsiensis, commonly known as the Guangxi pleocnemia, is a rare fern native to southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gleicheniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sori, which are arranged along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
