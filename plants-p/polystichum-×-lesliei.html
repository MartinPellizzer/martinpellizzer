                    <h1>Polystichum × lesliei</h1>
<p>Polystichum × lesliei, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Polystichum millefolium and Polystichum acrostichum.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its dense, upright fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant produces spores on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are covered in small, rounded structures called sorus. Native to the moist forests of eastern North America, it thrives in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for woodland gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
