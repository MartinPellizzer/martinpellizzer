                    <h1>Potamogeton × nitens var. intermedius</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × nitens var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Potamogeton nitens and Potamogeton × nitens.</p>
<p>It is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams, where it thrives in shallow to moderately deep waters. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, with a smooth surface and a midrib that is prominent. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and fish.</p>
<p>This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments and improve water quality.</p>
