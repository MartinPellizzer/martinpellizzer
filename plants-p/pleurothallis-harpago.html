                    <h1>Pleurothallis harpago</h1>
<p>Pleurothallis harpago, commonly known as the hook orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees and rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. It produces small, delicate flowers that are often white or pale green, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. The plant's roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, which is characteristic of many orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
