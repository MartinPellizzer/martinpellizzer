                    <h1>Potentilla dickinsii</h1>
<p>Potentilla dickinsii, commonly known as the Shetland silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Shetland Islands of Scotland.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and maritime climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
