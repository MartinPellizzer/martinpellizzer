The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value to its natural habitat. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Phoradendron cayanum typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
