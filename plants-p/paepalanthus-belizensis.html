                    <h1>Paepalanthus belizensis</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus belizensis, commonly known as the Belize pincushion cactus, is a unique flowering plant native to Central America, particularly Belize.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, spherical stems that resemble a pincushion. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the dry season, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and dry forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
