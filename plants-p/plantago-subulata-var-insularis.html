                    <h1>Plantago subulata var. insularis</h1>
<p>Plantago subulata var. insularis, commonly known as the island plantain, is a small, herbaceous plant native to certain island ecosystems.</p>
<p>It features narrow, pointed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, typical of the Plantaginaceae family. It is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or inland island habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range.</p>
