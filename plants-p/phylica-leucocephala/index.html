                            <h1>Phylica Leucocephala</h1>
<p>Phylica leucocephala is a striking evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is known for its clusters of white, fluffy flowers that resemble clouds, giving it a unique and eye-catching appearance. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract native pollinators make it both hardy and ecologically valuable. Often called the "white cloud" plant, it is a symbol of resilience and beauty in its natural habitat.</p>
