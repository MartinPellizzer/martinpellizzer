<p>Pedicularis rhinanthoides var. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and showy, spurred flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing vibrant red or orange flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in alpine ecosystems.</p>
