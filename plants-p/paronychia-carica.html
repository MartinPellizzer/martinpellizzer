                    <h1>Paronychia carica</h1>
<p>Paronychia carica, commonly known as the coastal bladderwrack, is a perennial seaweed that thrives in intertidal zones along rocky coastlines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green to brown coloration and a branched, filamentous structure that allows it to anchor itself to substrates. The plant produces small, egg-shaped sporangia that release spores into the water for reproduction. It plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms.</p>
<p>Paronychia carica is particularly adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including wave action and desiccation.</p>
