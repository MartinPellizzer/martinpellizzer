                    <h1>Poa imbecilla</h1>
<p>Poa imbecilla, commonly known as the dwarf mountain grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths that are well adapted to harsh alpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, Poa imbecilla is a common component of alpine and subalpine vegetation.</p>
