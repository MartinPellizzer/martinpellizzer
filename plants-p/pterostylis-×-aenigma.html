                    <h1>Pterostylis × aenigma</h1>
<p>Pterostylis × aenigma, commonly known as the mystery orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Pterostylis chloropus and Pterostylis maculata.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a single, slender, leafless stem that produces a single spike of small, greenish-white flowers. The flowers are characterized by their unique morphology, with a labellum that resembles a small insect, aiding in pollination by attracting specific insects. It is native to southeastern Australia and thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
