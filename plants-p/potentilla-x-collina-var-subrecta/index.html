                            <h1>Potentilla × Collina Var. Subrecta</h1>
<p>Potentilla × collina var. subrecta is a lesser-known yet striking member of the Rosaceae family known for its vibrant yellow flowers and hardy nature. This variant of the hybrid potentilla thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a versatile choice for gardeners in temperate climates. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it ideal for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover. While it may not be as widely cultivated as some of its relatives, it offers a unique aesthetic appeal with its delicate blooms and resilient character. Despite its modest profile, this plant is a valuable addition to any landscape seeking both beauty and low maintenance.</p>
