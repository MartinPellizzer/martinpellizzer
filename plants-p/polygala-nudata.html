<p>Polygala nudata, commonly known as the naked leaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, giving it the common name "naked leaf.".</p>
<p>Polygala nudata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and minimal water requirements.</p>
