                    <h1>Polyosma oligantha</h1>
<p>Polyosma oligantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as eucalypts, and derives some of its nutrients from them. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. Its flowers are white or pale green and are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, attracting birds that help in seed dispersal.</p>
