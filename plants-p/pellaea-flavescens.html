<p>Pellaea flavescens, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a yellowish tinge on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky soils or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Pellaea flavescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions.</p>
