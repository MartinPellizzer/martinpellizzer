                    <h1>Poa riphaea</h1>
<p>Poa riphaea, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage, which helps it thrive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa riphaea is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can withstand harsh weather conditions, making it a common component of alpine and subalpine vegetation.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species in its native range.</p>
