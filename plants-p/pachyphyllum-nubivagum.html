<p>Pachyphyllum nubivagum, commonly known as the cloud wandering cactus, is a unique succulent native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning, often in response to cool, moist conditions. Its growth pattern is slow and compact, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in its native range.</p>
