<p>It features small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous white flowers that emerge from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Peperomia tenuiflora is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage.</p>
