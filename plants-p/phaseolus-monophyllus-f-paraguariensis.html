<p>Phaseolus monophyllus f. paraguariensis, commonly known as the Guarana plant, is a climbing legume native to the Amazon basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces hard, woody pods that contain elliptical seeds covered in a red, velvety coating. These seeds are the primary source of caffeine and are often used in traditional medicine and as a stimulant.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it distinct within the Phaseolus genus, particularly due to its unique seed morphology and chemical composition.</p>
