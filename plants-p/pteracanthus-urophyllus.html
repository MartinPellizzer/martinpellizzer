<p>Pteracanthus urophyllus, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical regions of Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which helps in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant's unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
