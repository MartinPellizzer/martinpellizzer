<p>Platystyliparis platyrachis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in late summer. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of still or slow-moving water bodies.</p>
<p>Platystyliparis platyrachis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various water organisms.</p>
