<p>Piptatherum hilariae subsp.</p>
<p>badachschanicum, commonly known as the Badakhshan grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, exhibiting a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in its native habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its adaptation to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
