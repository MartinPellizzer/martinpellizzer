                    <h1>Primulina fengshanensis</h1>
<p>Primulina fengshanensis, commonly known as the Fengshan stonecrop, is a rare and ornamental plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant features fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a challenging species to cultivate outside its native region.</p>
