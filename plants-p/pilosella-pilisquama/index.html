                            <h1>Pilosella Pilisquama</h1>
<p>Pilosella pilisquama is a small, flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is known for its delicate, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a low-growing habit and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are hairy and narrow, giving it a unique appearance. Despite its modest size, Pilosella pilisquama plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
