                    <h1>Pecten</h1>
<p>Pecten, commonly known as the scallop, is a marine bivalve mollusk characterized by its distinctive fan-shaped shell.</p>
<p>The shell is composed of calcium carbonate and features a series of radial ribs and a prominent umbo at the center. The plant-like appearance of the shell has led to its historical use in herbal medicine. It thrives in coastal waters and is often found in sandy or muddy substrates.</p>
<p>Despite its name, Pecten is not a plant but a marine animal with unique biological and ecological significance.</p>
