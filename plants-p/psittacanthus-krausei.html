<p>Psittacanthus krausei, commonly known as the golden wax fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, floating fronds that are covered in a waxy, golden coating, which helps it thrive in still or slow-moving water. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form thick mats on the water surface. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive appearance that makes it popular in aquariums and water gardens.</p>
<p>Psittacanthus krausei is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
