                    <h1>Portulaca pilosa var. hirsutissima</h1>
<p>Portulaca pilosa var. hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy portulaca, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, hairy stems and leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close in the heat of the day. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important species in ecological studies of desert flora.</p>
