<p>Poa annua var. arenosa, commonly known as beach grass, is a coastal plant adapted to sandy environments.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in dunes and other disturbed coastal areas where it helps stabilize sand.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh, salty conditions makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
