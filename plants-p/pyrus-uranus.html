<p>Pyrus uranus, commonly known as the Uranean pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible pears that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are broad and lobed, providing a striking visual contrast to its delicate blossoms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pyrus uranus is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
