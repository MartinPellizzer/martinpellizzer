                    <h1>Peperomia sphagnicola</h1>
<p>Peperomia sphagnicola, commonly known as the bog peperomia, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It features dense, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in its moist, boggy habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, usually green or reddish, which are followed by tiny, round berries. It thrives in shady, humid conditions with well-draining, peaty soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a unique addition to both indoor and outdoor plant collections.</p>
