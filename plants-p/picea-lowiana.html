                    <h1>Picea lowiana</h1>
<p>Picea lowiana, commonly known as the Sitka spruce, is a large evergreen conifer native to the coastal regions of southeast Alaska and western Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, dark green foliage that turns a striking silver-blue in the winter. The tree produces small, cone-like fruits that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its roots are extensive and help stabilize coastal soils, making it an important species in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Picea lowiana is also valued for its strong, lightweight wood used in construction and musical instruments.</p>
