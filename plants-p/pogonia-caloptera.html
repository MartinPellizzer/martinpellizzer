                    <h1>Pogonia caloptera</h1>
<p>Pogonia caloptera, commonly known as the showy pleated orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pleated petals and a distinctive, showy orchid-like flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires a specific mycorrhizal association for nutrient uptake. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
