                    <h1>Pinus brachyphylla</h1>
<p>Pinus brachyphylla, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a coniferous tree native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and dense, compact growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The needles are short, typically measuring 1 to 2 centimeters, and are arranged in clusters of five. Its cones are small and often remain attached to the branches for many years.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna.</p>
