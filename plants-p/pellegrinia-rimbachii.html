<p>Pellegrinia rimbachii, commonly known as the Cape snowflake, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped white or pale blue flowers during the cooler months. It is well adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Pellegrinia rimbachii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of care in dry climates.</p>
