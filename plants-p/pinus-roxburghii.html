                    <h1>Pinus roxburghii</h1>
<p>Pinus roxburghii, commonly known as the Chir pine, is a tall, evergreen conifer native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender needles that grow in pairs, and its distinctive, cone-like structures that contain the seeds. The tree produces both male and female cones, with the male cones releasing pollen to fertilize the female cones. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and environmental stress.</p>
<p>This species is widely used in reforestation efforts due to its adaptability and ecological importance.</p>
