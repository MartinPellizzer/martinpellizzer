                    <h1>Phoradendron piperoides f. compositum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron piperoides f. compositum, commonly known as the composite mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Its unique ecological role makes it an important component of forest ecosystems.</p>
