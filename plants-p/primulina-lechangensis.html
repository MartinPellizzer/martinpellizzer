                    <h1>Primulina lechangensis</h1>
<p>Primulina lechangensis, commonly known as the Lechang stonecrop, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, an adaptation to its arid and rocky habitat. It produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom during the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
