                    <h1>Phaseolus gibbosifolius</h1>
<p>Phaseolus gibbosifolius, commonly known as the mountain bean or hairy pod bean, is a species native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a climbing legume with trifoliate leaves and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in its native arid environments. The plant produces elongated pods that contain small, edible seeds, similar to other members of the Phaseolus genus. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and potential as a food crop, it has been the subject of some horticultural interest.</p>
