                    <h1>Polypodium latipes</h1>
<p>Polypodium latipes, commonly known as the rock holly, is a terrestrial fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself in soil or stone.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many ferns.</p>
