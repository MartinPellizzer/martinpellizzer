                    <h1>Poa tibeticola</h1>
<p>Poa tibeticola, commonly known as the Tibetan feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage that reflects its adaptation to cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and for erosion control in mountainous areas.</p>
