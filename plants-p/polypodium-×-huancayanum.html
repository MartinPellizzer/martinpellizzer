                    <h1>Polypodium × huancayanum</h1>
<p>Polypodium × huancayanum, commonly known as the Huancayana shield fern, is a hybrid fern species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady gardens.</p>
