                    <h1>Poa lipskyi var. contracta</h1>
<p>Poa lipskyi var. contracta, commonly known as the compact meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter and more compact compared to other Poa species. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the plant. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
