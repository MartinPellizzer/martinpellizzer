<p>Phyllitis lindenii, commonly known as the Lindens' fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving streams and moist woodlands, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns.</p>
<p>Phyllitis lindenii plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its filtration capabilities.</p>
