                    <h1>Phegopteris reptans</h1>
<p>Phegopteris reptans, commonly known as the running fern, is a species of fern characterized by its creeping growth habit and finely divided, delicate fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is native to regions of eastern North America, including the eastern United States and parts of Canada. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes spread along the ground, allowing it to form dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in some varieties, contributing to its unique ecological role in low-light habitats.</p>
