                    <h1>Pedicularis langsdorffii var. gymnostemon</h1>
<p>Pedicularis langsdorffii var. gymnostemon, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on its host for nutrients while still performing some photosynthesis. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded labellum, which is a specialized structure that aids in pollination. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, often in association with specific host plants such as shrubs or trees.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an intriguing subject for botanical study.</p>
