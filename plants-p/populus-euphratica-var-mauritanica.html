<p>Populus euphratica var. mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritania poplar, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, corky bark and small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a hardy species suited to harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in coastal and desert areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
