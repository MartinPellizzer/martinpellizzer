The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. It is native to parts of Central America and is adapted to humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its parasitic lifestyle, with specialized structures for attaching to and drawing nutrients from its host.</p>
