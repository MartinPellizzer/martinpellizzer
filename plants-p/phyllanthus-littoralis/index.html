                            <h1>Phyllanthus Littoralis</h1>
<p>Phyllanthus littoralis is a unique plant species that thrives in coastal and wetland environments. It is known for its ability to tolerate saline and waterlogged soils, making it an important part of estuarine ecosystems. This shrub has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Despite its hardiness, Phyllanthus littoralis remains a relatively under-studied plant in botanical research.</p>
