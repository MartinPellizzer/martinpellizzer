                <h1>Peperomia obtusifolia</h1>
<p>Peperomia obtusifolia, commonly known as the glossy window plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features thick, waxy, ovate leaves that are typically green with a distinctive wavy margin and a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage rather than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Peperomia obtusifolia is a low-maintenance plant that is well-suited for indoor cultivation.</p>
