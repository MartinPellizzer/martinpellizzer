<p>Piptatherum songaricum, commonly known as the Songaric grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 (clumped) growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid regions.</p>
