                    <h1>Poa enysii</h1>
<p>Poa enysii, commonly known as Enys' bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the British Isles.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, a common trait among grasses, and it is often found in association with other moisture-loving flora.</p>
<p>Poa enysii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates.</p>
