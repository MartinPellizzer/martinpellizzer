                    <h1>Polypodium costulatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium costulatum, commonly known as the serrated holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with serrated edges and a light green to grayish-green color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering.</p>
