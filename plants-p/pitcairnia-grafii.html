<p>Pitcairnia grafii, commonly known as the glassy pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright rosette of fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, glassy coating. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with bright red bracts that can last for several months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia grafii is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique appearance.</p>
