                    <h1>Poa abbreviata var. jordalii</h1>
<p>Poa abbreviata var. jordalii, commonly known as Jordan's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This variety thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its small, spike-like inflorescences bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, which contribute to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded mountainous areas.</p>
