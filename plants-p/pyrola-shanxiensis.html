                    <h1>Pyrola shanxiensis</h1>
<p>Pyrola shanxiensis, commonly known as the Shanxi wintergreen, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Shanxi Province in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, preferring acidic soils rich in organic matter. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrola shanxiensis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
