<p>Picea purpurea var. balfouriana, commonly known as the Balfour's white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and silvery-blue needles that are shorter and more densely packed than those of other spruce species. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. Its foliage is highly aromatic, often described as having a sharp, resinous scent.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils.</p>
