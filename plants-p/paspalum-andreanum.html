<p>Paspalum andreanum, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and periodic flooding.</p>
<p>Paspalum andreanum is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and resilience.</p>
