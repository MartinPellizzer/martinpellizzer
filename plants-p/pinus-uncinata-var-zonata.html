                    <h1>Pinus uncinata var. zonata</h1>
<p>Pinus uncinata var. zonata, commonly known as the zonate mountain pine, is a variant of the mountain pine native to the Pyrenees and Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinct zonation pattern on the needles, which display alternating bands of light and dark green. The tree typically grows in high-altitude regions, adapting to harsh climatic conditions with its dense, slow-growing foliage. Its cones are relatively small and often persist on the tree for several years before opening.</p>
<p>This variety plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
