                    <h1>Pappophorum nigricans var. gracile</h1>
<p>Pappophorum nigricans var. gracile, commonly known as the slender bristlegrass, is a grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces distinctive bristly, hair-like structures called pappi, which aid in wind dispersal of its seeds. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and grasslands.</p>
<p>This variant is often distinguished by its more delicate appearance compared to the typical form of Pappophorum nigricans.</p>
