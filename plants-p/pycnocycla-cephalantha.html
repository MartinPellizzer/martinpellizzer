<p>Pycnocycla cephalantha, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Pycnocycla cephalantha is often found in coastal dunes and sandy plains, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
