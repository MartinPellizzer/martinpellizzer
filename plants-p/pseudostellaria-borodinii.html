<p>Pseudostellaria borodinii, commonly known as the Borodin's starwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often prostrate or ascending.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pseudostellaria borodinii is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species in botanical studies.</p>
