                    <h1>Poa pallida</h1>
<p>Poa pallida, commonly known as the pale meadowgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous blue-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in panicles. Poa pallida thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments.</p>
