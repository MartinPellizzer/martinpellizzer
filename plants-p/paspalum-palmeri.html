<p>Paspalum palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control in dry regions.</p>
