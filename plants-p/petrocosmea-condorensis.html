                    <h1>Petrocosmea condorensis</h1>
<p>Petrocosmea condorensis, commonly known as the Condor mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the Andean highlands of Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, adapted to the cold and low-nutrient conditions of its habitat. Its unique morphology includes narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a compact, pseudobulbous structure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, Petrocosmea condorensis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
