                    <h1>Potentilla laxiflora</h1>
<p>Potentilla laxiflora, commonly known as the slender flowered cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features wiry, arching stems that bear small, yellow, five-petaled flowers clustered in terminal racemes. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it tolerates cold temperatures and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
