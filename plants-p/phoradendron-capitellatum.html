                    <h1>Phoradendron capitellatum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron capitellatum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted for this parasitic lifestyle. The plant produces small, white or green berries that are dispersed by birds, aiding in its propagation. Its leaves are often thick and leathery, and it blooms with small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>Phoradendron capitellatum plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for various bird species and contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
