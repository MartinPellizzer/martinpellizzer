<p>Pyrethrum cedrorum, commonly known as the mountain pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called pappus that aid in seed dispersal by wind. Its botanical features include hairy stems and leaves, which help it withstand cold and arid conditions.</p>
<p>Pyrethrum cedrorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has potential uses in natural pest control due to its pyrethrin content.</p>
