                    <h1>Pygmaeothamnus</h1>
<p>Pygmaeothamnus, commonly known as the silverleaf thornbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the daisy family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The plants are shrubs with silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. They produce small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Pygmaeothamnus species are often used in landscaping due to their hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
