<p>Primula limnoica, commonly known as the water primrose, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant has erect, branching stems that bear clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its leaves are alternate, broadly ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Primula limnoica plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for various wildlife.</p>
