                    <h1>Pharbitis variifolia</h1>
<p>Pharbitis variifolia, commonly known as the variable morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that vary in size and shape, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in the morning. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for garden coverage, though it can become invasive if not controlled.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a spiral-shaped capsule, which aids in their dispersal by wind or animals.</p>
