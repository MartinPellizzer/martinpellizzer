<p>Potentilla gelida subsp.</p>
<p>elongata, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cold, rocky or alpine environments, often found in tundra and subarctic regions. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in extreme environments.</p>
