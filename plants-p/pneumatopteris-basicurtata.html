<p>Pneumatopteris basicurtata, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern characterized by its large, floating leaves.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a smooth, waxy surface that aids in buoyancy. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizomes for nutrient absorption and propagation.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for sexual reproduction.</p>
