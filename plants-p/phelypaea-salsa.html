<p>Phelypaea salsa, commonly known as the salt marsh spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort that thrives in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth and is often found in coastal areas and salt marshes. The plant has simple, closely spaced leaves that are usually green or bluish-green in color. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Phelypaea salsa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is an indicator species for saline conditions.</p>
