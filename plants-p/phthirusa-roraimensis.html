                    <h1>Phthirusa roraimensis</h1>
<p>Phthirusa roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima phthirus, is a rare flowering plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Guyana.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves and clusters of small, pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in the nutrient-poor soils of the highland plateaus, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it faces significant threats to its survival in the wild.</p>
