<p>Poa sudetica var. cucullata, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance, it is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its role in stabilizing soil in harsh climates.</p>
