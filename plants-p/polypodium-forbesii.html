<p>Polypodium forbesii, commonly known as Forbes' hart's-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, strap-like fronds that are tightly curled when young and unfurl as they mature. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round foliage, and the plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
