                    <h1>Paraphaius</h1>
<p>Paraphaius, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Paraphaius is considered an endangered species due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of both scientific interest and conservation efforts.</p>
