<p>Peucedanum trisectum, commonly known as the three-lobed cowparsley, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of 60â€“120 cm, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often trifoliate or three-lobed. Its flowers are small and white or pale green, appearing in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Peucedanum trisectum is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
