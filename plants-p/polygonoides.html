<p>Polygonoides, commonly known as the false nettle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Urticaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their opposite leaves, often with a hairy texture, and small, inconspicuous flowers. They are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Polygonoides species are often mistaken for true nettles due to their similar appearance.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants.</p>
