                    <h1>Primula acaulis</h1>
<p>Primula acaulis, commonly known as the cushion primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, forming a cushion-like structure that helps it thrive in alpine and rocky environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, white, and pink, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette, which aids in water retention and insulation.</p>
<p>Primula acaulis is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude meadows and scree slopes.</p>
