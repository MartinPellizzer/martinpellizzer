<p>Pedicularis przewalskii var. typica, commonly known as the Przewalski's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
