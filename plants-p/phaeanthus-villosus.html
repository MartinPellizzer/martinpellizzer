                    <h1>Phaeanthus villosus</h1>
<p>Phaeanthus villosus, commonly known as the woolly phaeanthus, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, or villose, stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a faintly colored throat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streams.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Phaeanthus villosus make it an interesting subject for study in both ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>
