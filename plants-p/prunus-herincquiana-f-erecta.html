                    <h1>Prunus herincquiana f. erecta</h1>
<p>Prunus herincquiana f. erecta, commonly known as the erect form of the Persian ironwood, is a distinctive variant of the Prunus genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, compact foliage, which sets it apart from the more sprawling forms of the species. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by dark, edible berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth margin and a glossy green surface, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant choice for landscaping.</p>
