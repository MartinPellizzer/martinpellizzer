                    <h1>Potentilla canescens proles polytoma</h1>
<p>Potentilla canescens proles polytoma, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its stems are often woody and branched, with a creeping or upright growth habit depending on the species.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to poor soil conditions.</p>
