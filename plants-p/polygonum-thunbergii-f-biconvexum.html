                    <h1>Polygonum thunbergii f. biconvexum</h1>
<p>Polygonum thunbergii f. biconvexum, commonly known as the broad-leafed knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often larger than those of the typical Polygonum thunbergii. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a hardy plant and a potential weed in certain habitats.</p>
