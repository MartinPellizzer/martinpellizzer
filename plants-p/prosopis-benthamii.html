<p>Prosopis benthamii, commonly known as the screwbean mesquite, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. The plant has small, palmate leaves that are typically shed during dry seasons, allowing it to conserve water. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to harsh, drought-prone environments.</p>
<p>Prosopis benthamii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
