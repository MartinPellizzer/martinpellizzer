                    <h1>Persicaria erectominor var. koreensis</h1>
<p>Persicaria erectominor var. koreensis, commonly known as the Korean knotweed, is a perennial herb native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common but sometimes invasive species in its native range.</p>
