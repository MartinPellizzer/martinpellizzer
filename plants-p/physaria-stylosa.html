                    <h1>Physaria stylosa</h1>
<p>Physaria stylosa, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, showy flowers and succulent-like leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to harsh, dry environments. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of yellow and orange, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Physaria stylosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
