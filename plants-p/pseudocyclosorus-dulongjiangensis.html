                    <h1>Pseudocyclosorus dulongjiangensis</h1>
<p>Pseudocyclosorus dulongjiangensis, commonly known as the Dulongjiang spleenwort, is a rare and ancient fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds and is typically found growing on moist, shaded rock surfaces in humid environments. The plant has a unique reproductive structure with spore-producing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Its botanical study provides insights into the evolutionary adaptations of epiphytic ferns in subtropical regions.</p>
