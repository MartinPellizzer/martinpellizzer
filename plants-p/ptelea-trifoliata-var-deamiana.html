                    <h1>Ptelea trifoliata var. deamiana</h1>
<p>Ptelea trifoliata var. deamiana, commonly known as the Deam's threeleaf, is a rare variant of the threeleaf sumac.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by red, fuzzy berries that persist into winter. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in woodland edges and open woods.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
