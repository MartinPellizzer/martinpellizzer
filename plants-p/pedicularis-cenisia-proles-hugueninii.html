                    <h1>Pedicularis cenisia proles hugueninii</h1>
<p>Pedicularis cenisia proles hugueninii, commonly known as the Huguenin's beardlip, is a rare and specialized member of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. This species typically grows in high-altitude alpine environments, often found in moist, shaded areas with specific host plants like Ericaceae. Its flowers are showy, with spurred petals that attract specific pollinators, such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
