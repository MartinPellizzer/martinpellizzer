                    <h1>Phaseolus monospermus</h1>
<p>Phaseolus monospermus, commonly known as the small-seeded bean, is a species of legume native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, typical of many Phaseolus species. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain one to three seeds, which are usually white or pale green in color. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its edible seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a less common species within the Phaseolus genus.</p>
