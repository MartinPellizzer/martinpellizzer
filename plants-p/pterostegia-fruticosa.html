                    <h1>Pterostegia fruticosa</h1>
<p>Pterostegia fruticosa, commonly known as the silverleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that allow it to absorb water and nutrients from its host. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a silvery waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health of its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
