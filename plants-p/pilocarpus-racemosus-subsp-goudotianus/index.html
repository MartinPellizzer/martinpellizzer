                            <h1>Pilocarpus Racemosus Subsp. Goudotianus</h1>
<p>Pilocarpus goudotianus, scientifically known as Pilocarpus racemosus subsp. goudotianus, is a rare and unique plant native to the Andean regions of South America. This evergreen shrub is prized for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional medicine for its stimulating effects. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is characterized by its dense foliage and small, fragrant flowers. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it faces significant conservation challenges. Its importance in both ecological and cultural contexts makes it a subject of growing scientific and environmental interest.</p>
