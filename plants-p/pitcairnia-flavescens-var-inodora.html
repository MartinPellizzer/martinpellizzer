<p>Pitcairnia flavescens var. inodora, commonly known as the sweet-scented pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, vibrant green leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect moisture from the humid environment. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing numerous small, white flowers that emit a subtle fragrance. It thrives in shaded, moist conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens.</p>
