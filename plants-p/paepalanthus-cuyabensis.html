<p>Paepalanthus cuyabensis, commonly known as the Cuyabensis puya, is a rare and unique plant native to the high Andean regions of Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spiky inflorescence that resembles a crown of spikes. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky, high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its leaves form a rosette that collects rainwater, providing a microhabitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss.</p>
