                    <h1>Poa radula</h1>
<p>Poa radula, commonly known as the rock bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa radula is adapted to harsh environments, including alpine and coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
