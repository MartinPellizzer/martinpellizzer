<p>Polypodium crenatopinnatum, commonly known as the serrated frond fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, serrated fronds that are typically divided into narrow, overlapping segments. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces adventitious roots, which help anchor it to substrates like rock or soil.</p>
<p>The spores are released from sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
