<p>Pedicularis gyroflexa subsp.</p>
<p>praetutiana, commonly known as the Alpine beardlip orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is native to the high alpine regions of Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and the Alps.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers with a distinctive beard-like lip. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
