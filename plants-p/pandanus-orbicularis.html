<p>It is characterized by its broad, waxy, and often colorful leaves that form a dense, fan-like structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically grouped in clusters at the base of the leaves. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread easily through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The leaves are used in traditional crafts and as thatching material in many island communities.</p>
