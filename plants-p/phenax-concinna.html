                <h1>Phenax concinna</h1>
<p>Phenax concinna, commonly known as the narrow-leafed broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, yellowish stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered at the ends of its stems. It is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, where it attaches to various host plants such as grasses and shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species.</p>
