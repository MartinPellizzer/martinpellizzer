                    <h1>Poa gammieana</h1>
<p>Poa gammieana, commonly known as the New Zealand hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it thrive in rocky and coastal environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, including salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient component of New Zealand's coastal flora.</p>
<p>Poa gammieana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
