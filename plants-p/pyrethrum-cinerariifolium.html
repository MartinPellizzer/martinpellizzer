                    <h1>Pyrethrum cinerariifolium</h1>
<p>Pyrethrum cinerariifolium, commonly known as tansy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant contains pyrethrins, which are natural insecticides used in organic pest control. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, often found in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
