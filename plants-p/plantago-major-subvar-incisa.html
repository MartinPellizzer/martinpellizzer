<p>Plantago major subvar. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly notched or lobed.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is commonly found in lawns, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes, which are arranged in two separate clusters on the stem. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is known for its medicinal properties, with the leaves traditionally used to treat wounds and skin irritations.</p>
