                    <h1>Phymatopsis rotunda</h1>
<p>Phymatopsis rotunda, commonly known as the roundleaf phymatopsis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its round, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying desert flora.</p>
