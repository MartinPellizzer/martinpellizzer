<p>Platystele dasyglossa, commonly known as the velvet leafed platystele, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, linear leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in high humidity and requires bright, indirect light to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
