                    <h1>Potentilla nana</h1>
<p>Potentilla nana, commonly known as dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters and features small, rounded leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
