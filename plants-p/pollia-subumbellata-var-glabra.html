                    <h1>Pollia subumbellata var. glabra</h1>
<p>Pollia subumbellata var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth pollia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Commelinaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its striking, spiral-arranged inflorescences that resemble a helix, composed of numerous small, colorful bracts. These bracts are often brightly colored, ranging from red to purple, and serve as a means of attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>The variety glabra is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous leaves, which lack the hairy texture seen in other varieties of the species.</p>
