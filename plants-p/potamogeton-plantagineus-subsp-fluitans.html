<p>Potamogeton plantagineus subsp.</p>
<p>fluitans, commonly known as the floating pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and wetlands.</p>
<p>The plant has long, slender stems that are often fully submerged, with small, oval-shaped leaves arranged in whorls. It produces tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its presence can indicate good water quality and is sometimes used as a bioindicator in ecological assessments.</p>
