                    <h1>Polystichum caducum</h1>
<p>Polystichum caducum, commonly known as the deciduous holly fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bi-colored, with the upper surface being dark green and the underside lighter. The plant is deciduous, shedding its fronds in the winter, which is a distinguishing feature from many other fern species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
