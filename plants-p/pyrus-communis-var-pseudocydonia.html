<p>Pyrus communis var. pseudocydonia, commonly known as the Chinese white pear, is a variant of the common pear that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree with smooth, gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves that are typically medium to dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by fruit that matures to a pale yellow or white color. The fruit is generally smaller and less juicy compared to typical pears, with a crisp, aromatic flesh.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and mild, sweet flavor.</p>
