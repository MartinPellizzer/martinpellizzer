<p>Puccinellia distans subsp.</p>
<p>hauptiana, commonly known as the Haupt's glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other moist, alkaline soils.</p>
<p>The plant has succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains tiny, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing coastal soils and its tolerance to extreme salinity.</p>
