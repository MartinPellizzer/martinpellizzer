<p>Pilosella bauhini subsp.</p>
<p>pseudobauhini, commonly known as the false bauhini, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces small, daisy-like flowers with white ray florets and yellow disk florets.</p>
<p>The plant typically has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its species name "pilosella," meaning "hairy.". It is native to southern Europe and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to other Pilosella species but can be distinguished by its specific morphological traits.</p>
