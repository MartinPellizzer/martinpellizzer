<p>Paspalum aquaticum, commonly known as water paspalum, is a grass species native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread across waterlogged soils. The plant typically has slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, helping to repel water.</p>
<p>Paspalum aquaticum plays an important role in stabilizing soil in aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
