                    <h1>Poecilopteris sinuosa</h1>
<p>Poecilopteris sinuosa, commonly known as the sinuous cliff fern, is a fossilized plant from the Carboniferous period.</p>
<p>It belongs to the order Marattiopsida and is characterized by its large, complex fronds with a distinctive sinuous venation pattern. The plant's structure suggests it was a robust, tree-like fern that thrived in swampy, tropical environments. Its leaves were likely broad and segmented, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in dense, humid forests.</p>
<p>Poecilopteris sinuosa provides important insights into the evolution of early ferns and the paleoecology of ancient ecosystems.</p>
