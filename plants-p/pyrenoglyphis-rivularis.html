<p>Pyrenoglyphis rivularis, commonly known as the river moss, is a type of aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like structures that form dense mats on the surface of streams and rivers. The plant has a simple morphology, with no true roots, stems, or leaves, and relies on spores for reproduction. It plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to pollution, it is often used as an indicator of water quality.</p>
