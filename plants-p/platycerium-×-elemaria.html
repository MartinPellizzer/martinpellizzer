                    <h1>Platycerium × elemaria</h1>
<p>Platycerium × elemaria, commonly known as the hybrid staghorn fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Platycerium bifidum and Platycerium superbum.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a distinctive, antler-like frond structure that gives it its common name. Its fronds are typically dark green with a velvety texture and can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters.</p>
<p>Platycerium × elemaria thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
