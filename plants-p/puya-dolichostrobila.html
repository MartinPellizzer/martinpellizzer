                    <h1>Puya dolichostrobila</h1>
<p>Puya dolichostrobila, commonly known as the long-strobilus puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andes of South America.</p>
<p>This evergreen perennial is characterized by its tall, rosette-shaped leaves that can reach several meters in height, forming a dense, water-holding structure. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences with vivid red or orange bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. Its unique structure supports a diverse array of epiphytic organisms, making it ecologically significant in its habitat.</p>
<p>Puya dolichostrobila is also noted for its slow growth and long lifespan, sometimes living for over a century.</p>
