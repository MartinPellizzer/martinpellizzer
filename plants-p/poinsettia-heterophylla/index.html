                            <h1>Poinsettia Heterophylla</h1>
<p>Common poinsettia, scientifically known as Poinsettia heterophylla, is a strikingly colorful plant native to Mexico and Guatemala. It is widely recognized for its vibrant red and green foliage, which resembles the traditional Christmas colors. This plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is often cultivated as a holiday decoration due to its festive appearance. While it is popular for its ornamental value, it is also known to be toxic to humans and pets if ingested. Despite its potential hazards, the common poinsettia remains a beloved symbol of the holiday season.</p>
