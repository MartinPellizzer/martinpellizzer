<p>Pinus parviflora subsp.</p>
<p>neoorbiculata, commonly known as the Japanese dwarf pine, is a small evergreen conifer native to Japan. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and needle-like leaves that are shorter and more clustered than those of the typical Pinus parviflora.</p>
<p>The cones are small and often reddish-brown when mature, and the tree produces seeds in these cones. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and bonsai cultivation.</p>
