                    <h1>Pinus strobus f. prostrata</h1>
<p>Pinus strobus f. prostrata, commonly known as the creeping white pine, is a low-growing variant of the eastern white pine.</p>
<p>It features a prostrate growth habit, with multiple stems spreading horizontally along the ground. The foliage consists of soft, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of the typical white pine. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain the plant's seeds.</p>
<p>This form is often found in shaded or disturbed sites, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils.</p>
