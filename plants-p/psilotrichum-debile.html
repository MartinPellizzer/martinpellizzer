                    <h1>Psilotrichum debile</h1>
<p>Psilotrichum debile, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Lycopodiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that form a dense, low-growing mat. The plant produces small, sporangium-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, it thrives in forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its ancient lineage, it provides insights into the evolutionary history of early land plants.</p>
