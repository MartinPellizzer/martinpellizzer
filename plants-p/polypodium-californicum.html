<p>Polypodium californicum, commonly known as the western wall-ruffle, is a fern native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or cliffs, thriving in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
