<p>It is characterized by its striking yellowish-orange bracts that surround the small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces a distinctive pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and ecology.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
