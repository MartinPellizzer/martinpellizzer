<p>Pyrus gabrieljanae, commonly known as Gabriel's pear, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Socotra.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, waxy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to common pears but are less commonly cultivated.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus gabrieljanae is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
