<p>Plagioscyphus meridionalis, commonly known as the southern star moss, is a terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features small, scale-like leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are borne on stalks and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Plagioscyphus meridionalis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates.</p>
