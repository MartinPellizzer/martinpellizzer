<p>Pilosella onegensis subsp.</p>
<p>madara, commonly known as the Madara's hairy cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, often silver-gray leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded habitats. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf structure and flower size.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to harsh climates.</p>
