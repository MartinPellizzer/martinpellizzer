<p>Polypodium glaucopruinatum, commonly known as the glaucous polypody, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically light green to bluish-green in color. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both roots and new fronds. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
