<p>Psorospermum affine, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood or simply sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is highly valued in perfumery and traditional medicine. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a leathery texture. Its small, white flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, spherical fruits containing smooth, black seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as an endangered species in many parts of its native range.</p>
