<p>Phegopteris copelandii, commonly known as the Copeland's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across the water's surface. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Phegopteris copelandii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation for various aquatic organisms.</p>
