<p>Polystichum rhizophyllum subsp.</p>
<p>cubense, commonly known as the Cuban shield fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and leathery.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The subspecies cubense is native to parts of Central and South America, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
