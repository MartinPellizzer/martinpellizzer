                    <h1>Poa subalpina</h1>
<p>Poa subalpina, commonly known as Alpine Bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and fine, blue-green foliage that thrives in cool, moist environments. This plant is adapted to high-altitude conditions, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Poa subalpina plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by providing forage for wildlife and contributing to soil structure.</p>
