<p>Poa muralis, commonly known as the wall grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, coastal, and urban environments, often growing in cracks and crevices of walls and pavements. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its small, spikelet-based inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Poa muralis is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in challenging habitats.</p>
