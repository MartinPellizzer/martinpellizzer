                    <h1>Pleurophora</h1>
<p>Pleurophora, commonly known as the "false orchid," is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often resemble those of true orchids. They typically have a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes and pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Pleurophora species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Their botanical features make them interesting subjects for study in both horticulture and ecological research.</p>
