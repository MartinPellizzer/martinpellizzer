<p>Pedicularis afghanica, commonly known as the Afghan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes numerous parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at high altitudes where conditions are harsh. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and are characterized by their spurred petals, a feature common in the genus Pedicularis.</p>
<p>The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis.</p>
