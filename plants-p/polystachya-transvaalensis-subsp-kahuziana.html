<p>Polystachya transvaalensis subsp.</p>
<p>kahuziana, commonly known as the Kahuzi bamboo, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking inflorescences with numerous small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in montane forests at elevations above 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
