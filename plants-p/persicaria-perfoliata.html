<p>Persicaria perfoliata, commonly known as common knotgrass, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers arranged in dense clusters along the stems. Its leaves are notable for their ability to form a continuous sheath around the stems, a feature that gives it its scientific name.</p>
<p>Persicaria perfoliata is often found in moist environments such as wet meadows and streambanks.</p>
