                    <h1>Peponium pageanum</h1>
<p>Peponium pageanum, commonly known as the giant bottle tree, is a unique succulent native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a thick, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting pollinators like moths. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The plant's distinctive appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in tropical and semi-tropical regions.</p>
