                    <h1>Pythius</h1>
<p>Pythius, commonly known as the root-knot nematode, is a genus of microscopic worms that belong to the family Heteroderidae.</p>
<p>These nematodes are notorious for their ability to infect the roots of a wide range of plants, causing significant damage to crops and ornamental plants. They feed on the root tissues, leading to galls or knots that disrupt the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients. Pythius species are particularly problematic in warm climates and are often found in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Their life cycle involves a free-living stage followed by a parasitic stage, making them difficult to control in agricultural settings.</p>
