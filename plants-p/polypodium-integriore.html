<p>Polypodium integriore, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a dense arrangement of small, ovate pinnae. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in forested areas. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are grouped in clusters.</p>
<p>Polypodium integriore is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
