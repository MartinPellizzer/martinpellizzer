<p>Phegopteris meniscioides, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across suitable substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, slightly curled appearance that contributes to its ornamental value.</p>
