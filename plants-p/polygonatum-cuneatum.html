                    <h1>Polygonatum cuneatum</h1>
<p>Polygonatum cuneatum, commonly known as the Solomon's seal, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its arching stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often overlooked in favor of its ornamental value. Polygonatum cuneatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and forest understories.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies over time.</p>
