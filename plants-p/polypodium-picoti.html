<p>Polypodium picoti, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. The plant has a rhizome that produces both roots and fronds, with the fronds typically being leathery and lance-shaped. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium picoti is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
