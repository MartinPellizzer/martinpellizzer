<p>Polypodium hydrophilum, commonly known as the water fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial and epiphytic plant, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant's rhizomes are usually covered with a thick, spongy layer that helps retain moisture. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are arranged in a tight, compact pattern.</p>
<p>Polypodium hydrophilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
