                    <h1>Perissocoeleum crinoideum</h1>
<p>Perissocoeleum crinoideum, commonly known as the star-coral sponge, is a unique marine organism that exhibits both sponge and coral-like characteristics.</p>
<p>It belongs to the order Astrophorida and is found in shallow tropical waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates. The plant has a branching, tree-like structure with a central axis and radial symmetry, resembling a flower or star. Its body is composed of a porous skeleton made of silica, which provides structural support and facilitates water flow for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in marine ecosystems by offering habitat and shelter to various small organisms.</p>
