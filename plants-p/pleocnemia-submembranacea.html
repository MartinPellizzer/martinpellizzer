<p>Pleocnemia submembranacea, commonly known as the membranous pleocnemia, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pterygopariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leafy structure with closely spaced, elongated leaves that are often covered in a thin, membranous layer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can retain adequate humidity. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, develop from specialized leaves called sporophylls.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
