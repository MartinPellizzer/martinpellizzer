<p>Persicaria alismifolia, commonly known as water plantain, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically 5-15 cm long and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer.
