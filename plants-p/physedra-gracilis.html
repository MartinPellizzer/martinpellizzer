<p>Physedra gracilis, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually reduced to scale-like structures, and it relies on its bladders for nutrient acquisition.</p>
<p>Physedra gracilis is a carnivorous plant, using its specialized bladders to capture and digest prey.</p>
