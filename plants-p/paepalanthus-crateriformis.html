                    <h1>Paepalanthus crateriformis</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus crateriformis, commonly known as the crater-shaped puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that resembles a crater, with vibrant red and orange flowers clustered around a central stem. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. The plant's unique structure and coloration make it a popular subject in botanical gardens and a symbol of the diverse flora of the Andes.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees.</p>
