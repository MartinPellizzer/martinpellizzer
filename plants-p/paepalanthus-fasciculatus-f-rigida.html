                    <h1>Paepalanthus fasciculatus f. rigida</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus fasciculatus f. rigida, commonly known as the rigid clustered pincushion cactus, is a unique succulent native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that form compact, cushion-like clusters. The plant produces small, white flowers during the warmer months, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
