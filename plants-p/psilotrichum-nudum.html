                    <h1>Psilotrichum nudum</h1>
<p>Psilotrichum nudum, commonly known as the naked clubmoss, is a small, primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant lacks true roots, instead having rhizomes that anchor it to the substrate. It produces sporangia in clusters at the base of the stems, which release spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>Psilotrichum nudum is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
