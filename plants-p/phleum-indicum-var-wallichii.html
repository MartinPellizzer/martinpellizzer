                    <h1>Phleum indicum var. wallichii</h1>
<p>Phleum indicum var. wallichii, commonly known as Himalayan oat, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental or for erosion control in suitable climates.</p>
