                    <h1>Pyrus nivalis f. subcoriacea</h1>
<p>Pyrus nivalis f. subcoriacea, commonly known as the silver-leafed pear, is a rare and ornamental variation of the common pear.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white, velvety foliage that contrasts with its dark green stems. The leaves are typically smaller and more densely covered with a fine, pubescent layer compared to the standard species. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar to those of the common pear.</p>
<p>This form is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and is adapted to temperate climates.</p>
