                    <h1>Ponthieva vasqueziae</h1>
<p>Ponthieva vasqueziae, commonly known as the VÃ¡squez's ponthieva, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect water, a common adaptation in humid, high-altitude environments. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often displaying vibrant colors to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ponthieva vasqueziae is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
