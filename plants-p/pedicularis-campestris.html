                    <h1>Pedicularis campestris</h1>
<p>Pedicularis campestris, commonly known as the field lousewort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats like meadows and roadsides, often in temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
