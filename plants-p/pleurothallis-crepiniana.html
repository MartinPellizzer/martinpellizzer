                    <h1>Pleurothallis crepiniana</h1>
<p>Pleurothallis crepiniana, commonly known as the crepiniana orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It is a small epiphytic orchid that thrives in humid, shaded environments within the cloud forests. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Its growth habit is typical of many pleurothallis species, with a compact, pseudobulbous structure.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicately endangered species.</p>
