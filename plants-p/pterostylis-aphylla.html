                    <h1>Pterostylis aphylla</h1>
<p>Pterostylis aphylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces a single, pale green or white flower with a distinctive, elongated shape. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in some regions.</p>
