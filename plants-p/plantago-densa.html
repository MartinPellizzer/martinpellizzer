                    <h1>Plantago densa</h1>
<p>Plantago densa, commonly known as dense plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is known for its medicinal properties.</p>
