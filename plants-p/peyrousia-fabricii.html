                    <h1>Peyrousia fabricii</h1>
<p>Peyrousia fabricii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the summer months. Peyrousia fabricii is adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary strategies for survival in nutrient-poor, sandy soils.</p>
