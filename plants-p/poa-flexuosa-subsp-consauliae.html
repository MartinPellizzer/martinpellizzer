<p>Poa flexuosa subsp.</p>
<p>consauliae, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typically containing two to three flowering branches. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability to harsh conditions, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions.</p>
