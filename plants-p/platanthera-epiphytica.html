                    <h1>Platanthera epiphytica</h1>
<p>Platanthera epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species that grows on the bark of trees in moist, shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>It is an epiphyte, meaning it derives its moisture and nutrients from the air, rain, and debris around its host rather than from soil. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent that attracts specific pollinators. It is often found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Platanthera epiphytica is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
