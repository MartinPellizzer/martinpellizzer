                    <h1>Pentaphragma cyrtandriforme</h1>
<p>Pentaphragma cyrtandriforme, commonly known as the yellow-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves and clusters of small, white or yellow flowers. The plant attaches itself to host trees, such as those in the families Dipterocarpaceae and Euphorbiaceae, through specialized haustoria that absorb water and nutrients. Its fruits are small, berry-like structures that contain seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited geographic distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat.</p>
