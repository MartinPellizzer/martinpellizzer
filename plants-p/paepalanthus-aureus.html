The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Paepalanthus aureus is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in regions with limited rainfall.</p>
