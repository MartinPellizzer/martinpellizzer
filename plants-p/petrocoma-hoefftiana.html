<p>Petrocoma hoefftiana, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant typically grows in crevices or on rocky surfaces, where it can anchor itself securely. Its small, star-shaped flowers are often pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Petrocoma hoefftiana is well adapted to harsh climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
