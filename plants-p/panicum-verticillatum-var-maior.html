<p>Panicum verticillatum var. maior, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, grass-like foliage that forms a low, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife, it is valued in ecological restoration projects.</p>
