<p>Polypodium chiapense, commonly known as the Chiapan fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Central America and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori.</p>
<p>Polypodium chiapense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
