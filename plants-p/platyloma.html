                    <h1>Platyloma</h1>
<p>Platyloma, commonly known as the broadleaf orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments. Platyloma species typically have broad, lance-shaped leaves and produce delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. They are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>The botanical significance of Platyloma lies in its unique floral structure and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
