<p>Paraprasophyllum montanum, commonly known as the mountain paraprasophyllum, is a rare and delicate plant species native to the alpine regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense, low-lying mats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
