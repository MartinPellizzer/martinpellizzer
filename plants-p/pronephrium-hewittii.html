<p>Pronephrium hewittii, commonly known as the Hewitt's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for trapping prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots.</p>
<p>Pronephrium hewittii is a carnivorous plant that plays a unique role in its ecosystem by contributing to nutrient cycling through its predatory behavior.</p>
