<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in rocky and dry habitats.</p>
<p>Phyllitis schizocarpa is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
