<p>Pellaea formosa, commonly known as the fairy fern, is a species of polypodiaceae that is native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 inches in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The fronds are bipinnate, with finely divided segments that give the plant its distinctive, ethereal appearance.</p>
