<p>Pabstiella cipoensis, commonly known as the Cipo rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many species of flowering plants known for their small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are often lobed. It typically blooms with bright yellow flowers in the spring, adapting to the high-altitude, rocky environments where it thrives.</p>
<p>Pabstiella cipoensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution.</p>
