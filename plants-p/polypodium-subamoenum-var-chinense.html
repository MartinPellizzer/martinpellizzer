<p>Polypodium subamoenum var. chinense, commonly known as the Chinese wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
