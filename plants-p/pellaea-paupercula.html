                    <h1>Pellaea paupercula</h1>
<p>Pellaea paupercula, commonly known as the poor pellaea, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. Pellaea paupercula thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or woodland soils.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes.</p>
