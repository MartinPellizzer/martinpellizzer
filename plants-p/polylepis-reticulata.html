<p>Polylepis reticulata, commonly known as the Andean quill tree, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fibrous bark and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, cold environments and thrives at elevations between 3,000 and 4,500 meters. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a leathery texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Polylepis reticulata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various Andean species.</p>
