                    <h1>Paphiopedilum ciliolare var. miteauanum</h1>
<p>Paphiopedilum ciliolare var. miteauanum, commonly known as the Miteauanum slipper orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a trap for pollinators. The plant typically features long, leathery leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, violet or pink flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings.</p>
