<p>Pedicularis waldheimii, commonly known as the golden monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in meadows and forest edges at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in several European countries.</p>
