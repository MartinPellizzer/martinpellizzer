<p>Piptochaetium laeve, commonly known as the smooth chaetum grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
