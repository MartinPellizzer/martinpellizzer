<p>Pseudomammillaria kraehenbuehlii, commonly known as the Kraehenbuehli's pincushion cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators. Its root system is shallow and adapted to absorb water quickly after rare rainfall events.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat requirements, it is a popular specimen among succulent enthusiasts and conservationists.</p>
