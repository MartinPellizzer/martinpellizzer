                    <h1>Picrodendron</h1>
<p>Picrodendron, commonly known as the "devil's backbone," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spirally twisted stems that resemble a serpent's spine, giving it its common name. The leaves are typically opposite and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitats. Picrodendron species are predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in South America.</p>
<p>They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, and they are often cultivated for their ornamental value.</p>
