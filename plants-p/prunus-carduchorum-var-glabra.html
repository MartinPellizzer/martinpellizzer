                    <h1>Prunus carduchorum var. glabra</h1>
<p>Prunus carduchorum var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries. It is often found in rocky or arid environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>This variety is distinct from other Prunus species due to its lack of hairy texture on the stems and leaves.</p>
