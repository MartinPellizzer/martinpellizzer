                    <h1>Platanthera mandarinorum var. hachijoensis</h1>
<p>Platanthera mandarinorum var. hachijoensis, commonly known as the Hachijo Island lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and a dense, spiraled inflorescence of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and mountainous regions. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is essential for its survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
