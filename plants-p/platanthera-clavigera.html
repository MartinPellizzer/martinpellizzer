                    <h1>Platanthera clavigera</h1>
<p>Platanthera clavigera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh-orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption, which is a common trait among orchids. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern in many regions.</p>
