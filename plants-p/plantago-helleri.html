<p>Plantago helleri, commonly known as Heller's plantain, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to brownish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade.</p>
