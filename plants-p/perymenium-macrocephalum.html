<p>Perymenium macrocephalum, commonly known as the giant bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant's leaves are thin and ribbon-like, adapted for floating on the water's surface. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, typically appearing in clusters.</p>
<p>Perymenium macrocephalum plays a unique role in its ecosystem by controlling populations of tiny aquatic prey.</p>
