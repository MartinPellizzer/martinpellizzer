<p>Pseudorhipsalis amazonica subsp.</p>
<p>chocoensis, commonly known as the Chocoan star cactus, is a rare epiphytic cactus native to the tropical rainforests of western Colombia. It features short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps protect it from excessive sunlight and moisture loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season, adding a delicate floral display to its foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
