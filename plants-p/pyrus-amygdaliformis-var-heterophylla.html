<p>Pyrus amygdaliformis var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf pear, is a botanical variant of the pear tree characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of China and is known for its variation in leaf shape and size, which can range from ovate to lanceolate. The plant typically produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar to common pears. Its leaves are often pubescent and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its genetic diversity and potential for cultivation.</p>
