                    <h1>Parathesis calophylla</h1>
<p>Parathesis calophylla, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds by wind. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many areas.</p>
