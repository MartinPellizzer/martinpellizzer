                    <h1>Pyrus pyraster f. folimancensis</h1>
<p>Pyrus pyraster f. folimancensis, commonly known as the Man√ßanilla pear, is a rare and cultivated form of the European pear.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that are often more pronounced and broader than those of the typical Pyrus pyraster. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by ornamental, edible fruits that are typically small and sweet. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible yield, though it is less commonly found in cultivation compared to other pear varieties.</p>
