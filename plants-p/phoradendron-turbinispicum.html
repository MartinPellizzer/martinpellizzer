                    <h1>Phoradendron turbinispicum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron turbinispicum, commonly known as the turbinated dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to host plants, primarily those in the legume family, through specialized haustoria that extract nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves seed dispersal by wind. Its structure is highly simplified, with most of its biomass concentrated in its flowering structures.</p>
<p>This species is native to Central and South America and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
