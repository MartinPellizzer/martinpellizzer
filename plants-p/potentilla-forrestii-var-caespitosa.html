                    <h1>Potentilla forrestii var. caespitosa</h1>
<p>Potentilla forrestii var. caespitosa, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a compact, mat-forming shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green leaves that are arranged in a dense,丛生 (clumped) growth pattern, which helps it thrive in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late summer, adding a bright contrast to its foliage. It is well adapted to rocky soils and cold climates, making it a hardy choice for gardeners in cooler regions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its tidy growth habit and long blooming period.</p>
