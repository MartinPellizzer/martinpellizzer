<p>Polystichum papuanum, commonly known as the Papuan wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright fronds with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine by local communities.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
