<p>Pleopeltis coadunata, commonly known as the Ceylon rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant has wiry, dark green fronds with a leathery texture and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid environments. It produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
