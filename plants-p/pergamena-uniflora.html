<p>Pergamena uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower parchment plant, is a rare flowering species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, single flower that blooms at the top of a slender, woody stem. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or white, with a subtle, aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
