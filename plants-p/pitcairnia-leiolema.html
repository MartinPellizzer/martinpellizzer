<p>Pitcairnia leiolema, commonly known as the silver-leaf pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red flowers that bloom in the early morning. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
