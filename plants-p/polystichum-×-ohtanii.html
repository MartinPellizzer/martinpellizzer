                    <h1>Polystichum × ohtanii</h1>
<p>Polystichum × ohtanii, commonly known as the hybrid Japanese shield fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Polystichum setiferum and Polystichum hondoense.</p>
<p>It is a robust evergreen fern characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are deeply divided into lance-shaped pinnae. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories across Japan. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the pinnae and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Polystichum × ohtanii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
