<p>Pasania echinophora, commonly known as the spiny pasania, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, spiny foliage that provides protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptation to harsh conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
