                    <h1>Poa sinattenuata var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Poa sinattenuata var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences, and its leaves are narrow with a distinctive blue-green coloration. One of its notable features is the presence of vivipary, where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks.</p>
