<p>Piaropus azureus, commonly known as the blue-eyed tree frog, is a species of tree frog native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue and green coloration, which serves as camouflage in its natural habitat. The plant associated with this frog, though not a true plant, is often referenced in botanical discussions due to its habitat in tropical rainforests. Its vibrant colors are due to pigments in its skin, which are not related to plant pigments.</p>
<p>The frog's presence is often indicative of a healthy ecosystem, highlighting the interconnectedness of flora and fauna.</p>
