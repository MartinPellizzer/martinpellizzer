<p>Parodia aureicentra var. variicolor, commonly known as the Golden Crown cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a dense, spiny coat of pale yellow to orange spines, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers during the summer months, typically in clusters at the top of the stems. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for small spaces, and it thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
