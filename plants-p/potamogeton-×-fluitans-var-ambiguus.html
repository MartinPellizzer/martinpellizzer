                    <h1>Potamogeton × fluitans var. ambiguus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × fluitans var. ambiguus, commonly known as the ambiguous water milfoil, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, often floating at the water's surface. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain environments.</p>
