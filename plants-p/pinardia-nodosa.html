<p>Pinardia nodosa, commonly known as the nodular liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a prostrate stem that bears leaf-like structures called phyllids. It produces sporangia on specialized stalks, which release spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>Pinardia nodosa is often used as an indicator species for assessing the health of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
