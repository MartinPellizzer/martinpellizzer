<p>Poa poophagorum var. hunczilapensis, commonly known as the Hunczilapensis meadow grass, is a rare grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
