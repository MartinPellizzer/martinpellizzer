<p>Polypodium excavatum var. concolor, commonly known as the common shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>The varietal form concolor is distinguished by its uniform coloration across the fronds, lacking the variegation seen in other varieties.</p>
