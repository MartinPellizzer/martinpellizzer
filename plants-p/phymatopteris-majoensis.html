<p>Phymatopteris majoensis, commonly known as the Majo fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in Mexico and parts of the Caribbean. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
