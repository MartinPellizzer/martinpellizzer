<p>Panicum cruciatum, commonly known as cross-leaved panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive cross-shaped leaf sheaths, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. Its slender, grass-like blades are usually less than a meter in height, and it produces small, pale green or brownish spikelets during the summer months.</p>
<p>Panicum cruciatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms.</p>
