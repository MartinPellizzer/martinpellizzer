                    <h1>Persicaria natans f. hartwrightii</h1>
<p>Persicaria natans f. hartwrightii, commonly known as floating knotweed, is a variant of the water knotweed species.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant is characterized by its floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, pinkish-white flowers appear in clusters and bloom during the summer months.</p>
<p>This form is notable for its distinct morphological differences from the typical species, including more compact growth and reduced leaf size.</p>
