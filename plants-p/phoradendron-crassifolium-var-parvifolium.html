                    <h1>Phoradendron crassifolium var. parvifolium</h1>
<p>Phoradendron crassifolium var. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in length, and its flowers are white or pale green, often clustered in small groups. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically red or yellow when mature, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its adaptation to a parasitic lifestyle, relying on host trees for water and nutrients while photosynthesizing to some extent.</p>
