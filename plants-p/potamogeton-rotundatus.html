                    <h1>Potamogeton rotundatus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton rotundatus, commonly known as roundleaf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats across Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It has slender, branching stems that are often leafless except for the lower portions, which bear small, round, bright green leaves. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spike-like clusters, and it relies on water currents for pollination. Its rhizomes form dense underwater mats, which can help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Potamogeton rotundatus is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to water clarity and supporting biodiversity.</p>
