The plant produces white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are typically oval and dark green, with a leathery texture that helps it survive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Pyrola declinata thrives in acidic soils and is often found in forest understories where it can receive dappled sunlight.</p>
