<p>Panax davidii, commonly known as Chinese ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China, Korea, and Russia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive fleshy roots, which are the primary part used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“100 cm, featuring compound leaves with serrated edges and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its roots contain various bioactive compounds, including ginsenosides, which are believed to have adaptogenic and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Panax davidii is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
