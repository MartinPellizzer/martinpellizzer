<p>Pappostipa speciosa var. media, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to western North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open woodlands and meadows, reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features slender, grass-like blades with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to the presence of awns.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
