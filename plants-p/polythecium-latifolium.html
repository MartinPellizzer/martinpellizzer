                    <h1>Polythecium latifolium</h1>
<p>Polythecium latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf polypore, is a wood-decaying fungus with a distinctive, saddle-shaped cap.</p>
<p>It typically grows on dead or decaying hardwoods, often found in temperate forest ecosystems. The fruiting body is perennial, with a tough, leathery texture and a pale to brownish coloration. Its spore-producing surface, or hymenium, is located on the underside of the cap.</p>
<p>This fungus plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling by breaking down lignin in dead wood.</p>
