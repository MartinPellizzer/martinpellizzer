                    <h1>Persicaria lapathifolia var. incana</h1>
<p>Persicaria lapathifolia var. incana, commonly known as hoary knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright stems that are hairy, especially along the veins, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The leaves are lanceolate, with a rough, hairy texture on both surfaces, and they are typically arranged alternately along the stem. Small, greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters at the tips of the stems, and the plant produces small, three-lobed berries that are edible but have a bland flavor.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
