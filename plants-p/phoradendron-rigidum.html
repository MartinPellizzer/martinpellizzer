                    <h1>Phoradendron rigidum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron rigidum, commonly known as the rigid mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy coating.</p>
<p>Phoradendron rigidum plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for birds and insects while also influencing the growth of its host trees.</p>
