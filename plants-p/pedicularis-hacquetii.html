<p>Pedicularis hacquetii, commonly known as the Hacquet's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while performing photosynthesis. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
