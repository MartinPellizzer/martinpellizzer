                    <h1>Platanthera psycodes f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Platanthera psycodes f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species characterized by its distinctive, fragrant, white flowers arranged in a loose, spiraling spike.</p>
<p>It is native to specific regions of Europe and is often found in moist, calcareous grasslands and woodland edges. The plant has long, strap-like leaves and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as moths and bees.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
