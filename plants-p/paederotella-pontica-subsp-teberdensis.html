<p>Paederotella pontica subsp.</p>
<p>teberdensis, commonly known as the Turkish water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of Turkey. It belongs to the family Salviniaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense, green canopy on the water surface.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, stout rhizome that anchors it to submerged substrates, and its reproductive structures are borne on specialized, floating leaves. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with soft, acidic conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
