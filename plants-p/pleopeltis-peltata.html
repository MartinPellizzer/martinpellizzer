<p>Pleopeltis peltata, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are relatively short and often form dense clusters, contributing to its ability to anchor itself in its habitat.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically evergreen, providing a lush appearance throughout the year.</p>
