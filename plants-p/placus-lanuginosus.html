                    <h1>Placus lanuginosus</h1>
<p>Placus lanuginosus, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, inflated bladders that trap and digest aquatic invertebrates. The plant has thin, branched stems covered in fine, woolly hairs, which give it its common name. It thrives in still or slow-moving water, often found in ponds and ditches.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
