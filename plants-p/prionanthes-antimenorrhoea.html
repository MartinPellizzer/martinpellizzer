                    <h1>Prionanthes antimenorrhoea</h1>
<p>Prionanthes antimenorrhoea, commonly known as the "abortifacient bladdernut," is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when mature, turning red as they ripen.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its medicinal properties, historically used for its abortifacient effects, though its use is now largely restricted due to toxicity.</p>
