<p>Polygonum humifixum, commonly known as swamp knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist or aquatic habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, rhizomatous stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a reddish tinge, while the flowers are small and clustered in spikes.</p>
<p>Polygonum humifixum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
