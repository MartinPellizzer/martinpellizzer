<p>Primula subpyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features basal leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a hairy texture, and produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
