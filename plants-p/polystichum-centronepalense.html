<p>Polystichum centronepalense, commonly known as the Central Nepal fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Nepal.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and finely serrated. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest understories at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clusters that contribute to the forest floor's biodiversity.</p>
<p>Polystichum centronepalense plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
