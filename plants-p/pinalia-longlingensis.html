                    <h1>Pinalia longlingensis</h1>
<p>Pinalia longlingensis, commonly known as the Longling pinyon, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its needle-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Botanically, it belongs to the Pinaceae family, sharing some traits with true pines but exhibiting unique morphological features.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pinalia longlingensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
