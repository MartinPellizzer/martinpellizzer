                    <h1>Pinguicula vulgaris var. pratensis</h1>
<p>Pinguicula vulgaris var. pratensis, commonly known as the common butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, with four petals arranged in a cross shape.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to absorb nutrients from captured prey, supplementing its nutrient-poor habitat.</p>
