<p>Polygonum aviculare subsp.</p>
<p>depressum, commonly known as dwarf knotweed, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems. It typically features small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to moist environments, such as wet meadows and stream banks, and thrives in temperate climates. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it a common weed in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The plant is also noted for its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions, which contributes to its widespread distribution.</p>
