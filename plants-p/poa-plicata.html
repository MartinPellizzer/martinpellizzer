<p>Poa plicata, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often rolled in a tight spiral. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, two-rowed spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Poa plicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in some ecological restoration projects.</p>
