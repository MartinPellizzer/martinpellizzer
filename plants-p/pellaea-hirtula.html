<p>Pellaea hirtula, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in small groups.</p>
<p>Pellaea hirtula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
