<p>Pleione tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly pleione, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen pseudobulbs and large, showy flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has a unique ability to survive in cold, shaded environments, making it a hardy species for cultivation in temperate climates. Its foliage consists of broad, fleshy leaves that store moisture, aiding in its survival during dry periods.</p>
<p>The wooly covering on its stems and leaves gives it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance.</p>
