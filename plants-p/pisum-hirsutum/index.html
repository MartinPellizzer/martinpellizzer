                            <h1>Pisum Hirsutum</h1>
<p>Pisum hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive hairy stems that give it its common name. This plant is widely used as a cover crop and forage due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers make it easily identifiable. Despite its benefits, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
