                    <h1>Phleum pratense f. viviparum</h1>
<p>Phleum pratense f. viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous tall fescue, is a variant of tall fescue characterized by its ability to produce live young through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>This plant is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grasslands and disturbed sites. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flower heads. The viviparous form exhibits a unique trait of producing fertile shoots from the base of the plant, enhancing its reproductive success.</p>
<p>This characteristic makes it particularly resilient in various environmental conditions.</p>
