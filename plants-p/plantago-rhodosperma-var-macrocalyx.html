                    <h1>Plantago rhodosperma var. macrocalyx</h1>
<p>Plantago rhodosperma var. macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-calyx plantain, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces showy, spathaceous inflorescences with small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense spikes. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated, fleshy capsules, which aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its resilience and ornamental qualities in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
