                    <h1>Pyrus kaschkarovii</h1>
<p>Pyrus kaschkarovii, commonly known as the Karakorum pear, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, grey bark and broad, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that are adapted to the harsh alpine environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cold climate to complete its winter dormancy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
