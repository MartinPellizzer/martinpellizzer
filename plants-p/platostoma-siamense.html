                    <h1>Platostoma siamense</h1>
<p>Platostoma siamense, commonly known as the Siam flat lichen, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungal partner from the Ascomycota division. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks and rocks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its structure and chemical composition make it an important indicator species for assessing environmental conditions.</p>
