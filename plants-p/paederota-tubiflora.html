                    <h1>Paederota tubiflora</h1>
<p>Paederota tubiflora, commonly known as the tuberous flax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, tuberous roots that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Paederota tubiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens.</p>
