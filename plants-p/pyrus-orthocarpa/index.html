                            <h1>Pyrus Orthocarpa</h1>
<p>Common white pear, scientifically known as Pyrus orthocarpa, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of Asia and the Pacific Northwest of North America. This species is prized for its ornamental value, featuring elegant white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the pale blossoms. The fruit, though not typically consumed by humans, is edible for wildlife and adds to the ecological importance of the plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
