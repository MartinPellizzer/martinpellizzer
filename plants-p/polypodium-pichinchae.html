<p>Polypodium pichinchae, commonly known as the Pichincha fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that typically grow on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a feathery appearance, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium pichinchae is often found in cloud forests and is adapted to the humid, cool conditions of its native habitat.</p>
