<p>Polypodium ellipticum var. simplicifrons, commonly known as the simple-fruited cliff fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rugged texture.

It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal.</p>
