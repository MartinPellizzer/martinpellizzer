                    <h1>Poa lithophila</h1>
<p>Poa lithophila, commonly known as the rock grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing on crevices and slopes where soil is scarce. The plant has slender, tufted leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomes allow it to anchor itself firmly in crevices, making it well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Poa lithophila plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small alpine organisms.</p>
