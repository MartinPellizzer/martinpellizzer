<p>Polypodium lineare var. schraderi, commonly known as the Schrader's maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common holly fern.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are usually bipinnate, featuring a distinctive, delicate, and feathery appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery covering called a indusium.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
