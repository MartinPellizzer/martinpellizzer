                    <h1>Platanthera platycorys</h1>
<p>Platanthera platycorys, commonly known as the broad-lobed twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant has a distinctive appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, showy white or pale yellow flower. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened or endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
