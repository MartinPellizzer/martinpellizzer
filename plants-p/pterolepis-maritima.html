<p>Pterolepis maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in saline and sandy environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found growing along shores and dunes. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against salt spray.</p>
<p>Pterolepis maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils.</p>
