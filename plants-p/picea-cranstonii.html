                    <h1>Picea cranstonii</h1>
<p>Picea cranstonii, commonly known as the Cranston spruce, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a single row along the branches. The cones of Picea cranstonii are small and woody, with a distinctive shape and structure typical of the spruce genus. This species thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
