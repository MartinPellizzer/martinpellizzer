                    <h1>Pectis miser</h1>
<p>Pectis miser, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that resemble dandelion fluff. Pectis miser is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in disturbed soils or rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its resilience to drought and extreme temperatures.</p>
