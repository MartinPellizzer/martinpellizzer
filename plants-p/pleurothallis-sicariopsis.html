<p>Pleurothallis sicariopsis, commonly known as the "poison arrow orchid," is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and association with indigenous cultures have made it a subject of both botanical and cultural interest.</p>
<p>Despite its striking beauty, it is not commonly cultivated outside its native habitat due to its specific care requirements.</p>
