                    <h1>Pseudomertensia primuloides</h1>
<p>Pseudomertensia primuloides, commonly known as the fairy moss, is a low-growing, evergreen plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
