                    <h1>Pteranthera mangachapoi</h1>
<p>Pteranthera mangachapoi, commonly known as the mangachapoi cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its botanical features include a thick, fibrous root system and a slow growth rate, which contributes to its longevity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts for this rare species.</p>
