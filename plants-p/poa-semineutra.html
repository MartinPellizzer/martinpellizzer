                    <h1>Poa semineutra</h1>
<p>Poa semineutra, commonly known as the sterile bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is notable for its lack of viable seeds, as the flowers do not produce functional seed capsules. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies.</p>
