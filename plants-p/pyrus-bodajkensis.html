<p>Pyrus bodajkensis, commonly known as the Bodajk√≥ pear, is a rare and ancient species native to the Carpathian Basin.</p>
<p>It is a small deciduous tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils. The plant is characterized by its serrated leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. Its fruits are pomes, similar to common pears, but are less commonly cultivated.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
