                    <h1>Psythirhisma</h1>
<p>Psythirhisma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale green or white, leafless stems and its striking, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba, it thrives in swampy, shaded environments with high humidity. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, Psythirhisma is listed as endangered, making it a subject of conservation interest.</p>
