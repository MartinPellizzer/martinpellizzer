                    <h1>Pyrus neptunus</h1>
<p>Pyrus neptunus, commonly known as the Neptune's pear, is a rare and ancient species of pear native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped fruits that are typically green when mature, with a thin, smooth skin. The plant produces white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and historical significance, Pyrus neptunus is considered a botanical curiosity and is often studied for its genetic diversity and potential horticultural value.</p>
