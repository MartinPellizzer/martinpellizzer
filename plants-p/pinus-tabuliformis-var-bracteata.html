                    <h1>Pinus tabuliformis var. bracteata</h1>
<p>Pinus tabuliformis var. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate pine, is a variant of the Chinese pine, characterized by its unique foliage and cone structures.</p>
<p>It is native to northern China and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. The leaves are typically shorter and more clustered compared to the standard variety, giving it a distinct appearance. Its cones are woody and can persist on the tree for several years, contributing to its ecological role in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts due to its adaptability and resilience.</p>
