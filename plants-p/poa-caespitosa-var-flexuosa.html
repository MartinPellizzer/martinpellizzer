                    <h1>Poa caespitosa var. flexuosa</h1>
<p>Poa caespitosa var. flexuosa, commonly known as the bentgrass or creeping bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that often curl at the tips. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its fine texture and ability to form dense mats, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping.</p>
