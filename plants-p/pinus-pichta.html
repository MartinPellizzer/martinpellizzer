                    <h1>Pinus pichta</h1>
<p>Pinus pichta, commonly known as the white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are initially green but mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thin and flaky, becoming thicker and more fissured with age.</p>
<p>The white spruce is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in boreal forests and mountainous areas.</p>
