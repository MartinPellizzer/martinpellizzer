<p>Plantago asplundii, commonly known as the desert plantain, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has a basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes, which are often hidden among the foliage. It is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and can thrive in low-nutrient conditions.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system allows it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
