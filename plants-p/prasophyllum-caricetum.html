                    <h1>Prasophyllum caricetum</h1>
<p>Prasophyllum caricetum, commonly known as the dwarf leek orchid, is a rare and small terrestrial orchid native to the south-western region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in heathland and sandy soils, often in areas with low rainfall. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single spike of pale green to brownish flowers. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its specialized root system that forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
