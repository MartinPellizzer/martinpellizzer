<p>Paracaryopsis, commonly known as the "false millet," is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of a single species, Paracaryopsis gluma, which is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces tiny, spikelet-like flowers that are often encased in bracts.</p>
<p>Paracaryopsis is primarily of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
