                    <h1>Primula forbesii var. brevipes</h1>
<p>Primula forbesii var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed primrose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, which help it withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a waxy coating, typical of many primrose species.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
