                    <h1>Polypodium rufulum var. majus</h1>
<p>Polypodium rufulum var. majus, commonly known as the giant wall fern, is a variant of the polypody fern that is native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
