                    <h1>Poa subcompressa</h1>
<p>Poa subcompressa, commonly known as the compressed bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly compressed along the midrib. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences, typically with two to three flowering glumes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in shaded woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to form dense turf, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
