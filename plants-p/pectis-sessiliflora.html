<p>Pectis sessiliflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pectis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and ray flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
