<p>Potamogeton marinus var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to coastal and brackish water environments.</p>
<p>It has long, slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, adapted for life in shallow, freshwater or saltwater habitats. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which emerge from the water surface during the growing season. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality in its native habitats.</p>
