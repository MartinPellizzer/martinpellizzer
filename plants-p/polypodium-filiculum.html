                    <h1>Polypodium filiculum</h1>
<p>Polypodium filiculum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that grow close to the ground. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. Its rhizome is often covered in a dense layer of roots, which helps it anchor to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
