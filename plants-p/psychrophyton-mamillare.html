                    <h1>Psychrophyton mamillare</h1>
<p>Psychrophyton mamillare, commonly known as the snowflake orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that resemble snowflakes. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and requires specific conditions to bloom, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Psychrophyton mamillare is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
