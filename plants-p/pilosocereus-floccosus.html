                    <h1>Pilosocereus floccosus</h1>
<p>Pilosocereus floccosus, commonly known as the white cactus or woolly cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to desert environments.</p>
<p>Pilosocereus floccosus is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
