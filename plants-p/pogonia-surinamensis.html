<p>Pogonia surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale pink or white flowers, which resemble the shape of a ghostly face, giving it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, growing on tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
