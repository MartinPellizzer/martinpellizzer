<p>Phalacrodiscus cebennensis, commonly known as the Cebenna water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it to the lake or pond bottom while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and pollution, it is listed as endangered in several regions, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
