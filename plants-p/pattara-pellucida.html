<p>Pattara pellucida, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a delicate and rare species of fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and indirect light. Its fronds are typically small and intricate, with a unique structure that allows it to absorb nutrients efficiently from the forest floor.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Pattara pellucida is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
