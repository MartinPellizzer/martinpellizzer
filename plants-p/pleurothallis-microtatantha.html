<p>Pleurothallis microtatantha, commonly known as the tiny white pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which are often clustered in small inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted for efficient water absorption in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range.</p>
