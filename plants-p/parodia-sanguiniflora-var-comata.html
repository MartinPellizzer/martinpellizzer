                    <h1>Parodia sanguiniflora var. comata</h1>
<p>Parodia sanguiniflora var. comata, commonly known as the woolly red torch cactus, is a succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces bright red flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is well-suited for container gardening.</p>
