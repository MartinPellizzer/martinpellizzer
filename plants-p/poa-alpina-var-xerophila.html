                    <h1>Poa alpina var. xerophila</h1>
<p>Poa alpina var. xerophila, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a variant of the alpine bluegrass that thrives in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it withstand harsh climatic conditions. This plant is typically found in mountainous regions, where it grows in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its ability to survive in low-nutrient, cold climates makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>The species is also notable for its resilience to extreme weather and its role in preventing soil erosion in rocky habitats.</p>
