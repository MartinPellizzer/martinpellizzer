                    <h1>Pinalia fitzalanii</h1>
<p>Pinalia fitzalanii, commonly known as the Fitzalan's pinalia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to arid environments. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in spring, and the plant produces distinctive bracts that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pinalia fitzalanii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
