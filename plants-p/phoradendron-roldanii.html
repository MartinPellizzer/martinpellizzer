                    <h1>Phoradendron roldanii</h1>
<p>Phoradendron roldanii, commonly known as the red mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the neotropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of red, fleshy berries. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also deriving some photosynthetic ability from its own leaves. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the berries, facilitating its spread across different host species.</p>
<p>This plant plays a significant ecological role in its habitat, influencing host tree growth and supporting bird populations.</p>
