                    <h1>Psychotria leucophaea</h1>
<p>Psychotria leucophaea, commonly known as the white-leaved psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically white or pale green in color, which helps it reflect light in low-light environments. It produces small, clustered white or greenish-white flowers that bloom throughout the year.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids such as dimethyltryptamine (DMT).</p>
