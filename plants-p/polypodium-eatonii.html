<p>Polypodium eatonii, commonly known as the Eatonâ€™s hart's-tongue fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, leathery, strap-like fronds that resemble a tongue, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are evergreen, remaining green throughout the year, and produce sporangia on the underside of the leaves.</p>
