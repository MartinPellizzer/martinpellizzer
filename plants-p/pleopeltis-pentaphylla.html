<p>Pleopeltis pentaphylla, commonly known as the five-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds with five pairs of leaflets. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of root hairs, which helps in water absorption.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens.</p>
