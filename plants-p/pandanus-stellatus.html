                    <h1>Pandanus stellatus</h1>
<p>Pandanus stellatus, commonly known as the star pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in a spadix, which is surrounded by a leaf-like bract. Its fibrous roots and robust structure make it well adapted to coastal and wetland environments.</p>
<p>The star pandanus is also valued for its ornamental appearance and traditional uses in various island cultures.</p>
