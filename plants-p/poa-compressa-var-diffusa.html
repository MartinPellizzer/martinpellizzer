<p>Poa compressa var. diffusa, commonly known as the silvergrass or soft bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth with narrow, bluish-gray leaves that are slightly compressed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are clustered along the stems, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Its fine texture and ability to thrive in low-light conditions make it a popular choice for ornamental and ecological landscaping.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
