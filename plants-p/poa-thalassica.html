                    <h1>Poa thalassica</h1>
<p>Poa thalassica, commonly known as sea meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and coastal meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it a key component of tidal ecosystems.</p>
