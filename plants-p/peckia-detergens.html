<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is notable for its ability to produce a soapy foam when its leaves are disturbed, which is a natural defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The genus Peckia belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes other plants with similar morphological traits.</p>
