<p>Poa commutata, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a cool-season grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted blades with a fine texture and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a bluish-green color, which helps it thrive in shady or wet conditions.</p>
<p>Poa commutata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
