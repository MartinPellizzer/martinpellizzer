                    <h1>Pyrrhocactus glaucescens</h1>
<p>Pyrrhocactus glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-green cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in a waxy, bluish-green coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its muted foliage. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Pyrrhocactus glaucescens is often found growing in rocky soils and is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
