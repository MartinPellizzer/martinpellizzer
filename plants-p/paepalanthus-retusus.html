                    <h1>Paepalanthus retusus</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus retusus, commonly known as the hairy pincushion cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus characterized by its dense clusters of spiny, woolly stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, adapting to arid environments.</p>
<p>Paepalanthus retusus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance.</p>
