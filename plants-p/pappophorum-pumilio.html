                    <h1>Pappophorum pumilio</h1>
<p>Pappophorum pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf pappophore, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is characterized by its delicate, wind-dispersed seeds, which are enclosed in a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in seed distribution. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
