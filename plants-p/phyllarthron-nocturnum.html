<p>Phyllarthron nocturnum, commonly known as the nightshade ivy, is a perennial flowering plant native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids similar to those found in other nightshade family members. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its unique nocturnal blooming habit makes it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
