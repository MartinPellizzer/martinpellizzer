                    <h1>Platanus orientalis var. nepalensis</h1>
<p>Platanus orientalis var. nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces spherical, smooth-barked trunks and is often found in moist, shady environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, while its fruit is a three-winged samara that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to the common sycamore but exhibits distinct morphological features adapted to its mountainous habitat.</p>
