                    <h1>Pleuropteropyrum microcarpum</h1>
<p>Pleuropteropyrum microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited pleuropteropyrum, is a rare and little-studied member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rounded fruits and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small, greenish-yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
