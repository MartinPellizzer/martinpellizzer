                    <h1>Polypodium ruizianum</h1>
<p>Polypodium ruizianum, commonly known as the Ruiz's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, humid environments, often as an epiphyte. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
