                    <h1>Pyrus quinqueflora</h1>
<p>Pyrus quinqueflora, commonly known as the five-flowered pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers in early spring, which are often followed by small, edible fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or as a border plant.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, Pyrus quinqueflora is occasionally cultivated in horticulture.</p>
