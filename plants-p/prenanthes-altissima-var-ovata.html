                    <h1>Prenanthes altissima var. ovata</h1>
<p>Prenanthes altissima var. ovata, commonly known as the tall water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its root system helps stabilize soil and improve water quality in marshes and pond edges.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its ovate leaf shape, setting it apart from other varieties within the Prenanthes genus.</p>
