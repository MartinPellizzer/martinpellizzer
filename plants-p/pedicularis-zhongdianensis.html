<p>Pedicularis zhongdianensis, commonly known as the Zhongdian monkey orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family native to the high-altitude regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid red and yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its specialized roots. Its unique floral structure and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered.</p>
