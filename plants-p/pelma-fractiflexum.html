<p>Pelma fractiflexum, commonly known as the brittle flex vine, is a climbing plant native to the temperate rainforests of southern Patagonia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems that can bend and twist around supports, allowing it to climb efficiently. The leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy cuticle that helps retain moisture in its humid habitat. Its flowers are small, pale green, and clustered in loose inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant is noted for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in shaded, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
