<p>Polypodium vulgare subsp.</p>
<p>columbianum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided, lacy appearance.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices, where it can anchor itself to substrates. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns.</p>
<p>The subspecies columbianum is distinguished by its slightly larger fronds and more robust growth compared to the typical form of P. vulgare.</p>
