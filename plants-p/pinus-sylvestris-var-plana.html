                    <h1>Pinus sylvestris var. plana</h1>
<p>Pinus sylvestris var. plana, commonly known as the Scots pine, is a variant of the Scots pine species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, scale-like leaves that are typically 1–3 cm long, which distinguish it from the more common needle-like leaves of the standard Scots pine. The tree produces cones that are usually 5–10 cm long, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic conditions.</p>
<p>This evergreen conifer is often used in landscaping and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
