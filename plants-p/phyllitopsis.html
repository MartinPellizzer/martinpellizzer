                    <h1>Phyllitopsis</h1>
<p>Phyllitopsis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of small, delicate ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in rocky or shaded environments, often growing on soil or rock surfaces. Phyllitopsis species are characterized by their narrow, linear leaves that are often arranged in a compact rosette. They are generally epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they can grow on other plants or rocks without soil.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, each adapted to specific microhabitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
