                    <h1>Pleudia geminata</h1>
<p>Pleudia geminata, commonly known as the twin-leaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that often grow in pairs, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet-colored flowers during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Pleudia geminata is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
