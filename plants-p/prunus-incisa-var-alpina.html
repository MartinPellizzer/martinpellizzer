                    <h1>Prunus incisa var. alpina</h1>
<p>Prunus incisa var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically pubescent beneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-red drupes. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens in temperate climates.</p>
