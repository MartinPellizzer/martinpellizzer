                    <h1>Pabstiella alligatorifera</h1>
<p>Pabstiella alligatorifera, commonly known as the alligator fern, is a rare and delicate plant species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, feathery fronds that resemble the scales of an alligator, hence its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense tropical forests where it clings to tree trunks or grows on rocky surfaces. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small, spore-producing clusters along the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pabstiella alligatorifera is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
