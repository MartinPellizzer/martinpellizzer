                    <h1>Pellaea timorensis</h1>
<p>Pellaea timorensis, commonly known as the Timor spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to the island of Timor.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, typical of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
