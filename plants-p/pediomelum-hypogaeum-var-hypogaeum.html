                    <h1>Pediomelum hypogaeum var. hypogaeum</h1>
<p>Pediomelum hypogaeum var. hypogaeum, commonly known as the underground cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its subterranean growth habit, with fleshy, succulent roots and stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom above ground, often in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to that of watercress.</p>
