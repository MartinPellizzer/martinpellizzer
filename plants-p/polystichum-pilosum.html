<p>Polystichum pilosum, commonly known as the silky fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, silky-textured fronds that give it a soft, elegant appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Polystichum pilosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cool, humid conditions.</p>
