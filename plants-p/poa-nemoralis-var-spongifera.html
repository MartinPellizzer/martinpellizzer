                    <h1>Poa nemoralis var. spongifera</h1>
<p>Poa nemoralis var. spongifera, commonly known as the spongy wood sedge, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive spongy texture, which contributes to its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in association with other wetland vegetation and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates.</p>
