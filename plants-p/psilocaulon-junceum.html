                    <h1>Psilocaulon junceum</h1>
<p>Psilocaulon junceum, commonly known as the slender swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 10â€“30 centimeters, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Psilocaulon junceum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
