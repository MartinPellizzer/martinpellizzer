                    <h1>Phegopteris walkerae</h1>
<p>Phegopteris walkerae, commonly known as the walking fern, is a species of fern characterized by its unique upright growth habit and its ability to "walk" by extending its rhizomes along the ground.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous stem system that allows it to spread horizontally, forming dense colonies. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, grass-like appearance.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
