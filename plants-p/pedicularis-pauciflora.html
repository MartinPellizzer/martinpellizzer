                    <h1>Pedicularis pauciflora</h1>
<p>Pedicularis pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered lousewort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a unique spurred structure that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
