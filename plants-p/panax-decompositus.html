                    <h1>Panax decompositus</h1>
<p>Panax decompositus, commonly known as the decomposed ginseng, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the temperate regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, thick rhizome and a cluster of small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Due to its rarity and limited distribution, it is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>However, its ecological role and reproductive biology remain poorly understood, making it a subject of ongoing research.</p>
