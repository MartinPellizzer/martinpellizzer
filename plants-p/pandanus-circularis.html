                    <h1>Pandanus circularis</h1>
<p>Pandanus circularis, commonly known as the pandanus tree or screw pine, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that form a dense, umbrella-like canopy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into three-lobed fruits, each containing a single seed. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to coastal environments, allowing it to thrive in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Pandanus circularis plays an important role in traditional island cultures, often used for thatching and basket weaving.</p>
