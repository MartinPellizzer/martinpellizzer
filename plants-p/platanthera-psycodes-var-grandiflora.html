                    <h1>Platanthera psycodes var. grandiflora</h1>
<p>Platanthera psycodes var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine, hairy texture.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
