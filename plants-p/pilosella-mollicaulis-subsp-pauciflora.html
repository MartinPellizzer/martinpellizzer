<p>Pilosella mollicaulis subsp.</p>
<p>pauciflora, commonly known as the slenderleaf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its reduced number of flowers per inflorescence, which is a key feature of the subspecies pauciflora. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its hairy foliage and compact growth form help it retain moisture and withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
