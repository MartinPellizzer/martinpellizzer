                    <h1>Phyllanthus chiapensis</h1>
<p>Phyllanthus chiapensis, commonly known as Chiapas phyllanthus, is a shrub native to Central America, particularly found in the humid lowland forests of Chiapas, Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a capsule containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in understorey layers of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
