<p>Pimpinella caroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cow parsley, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its seeds are enclosed in a dry, hairy fruit called a schizocarp, which splits into two one-seeded parts when mature.</p>
<p>Pimpinella caroides is often found in woodland edges and meadows, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
