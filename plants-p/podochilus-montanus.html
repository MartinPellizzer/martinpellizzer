<p>Podochilus montanus, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features a slender, erect stem with several leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Podochilus montanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
