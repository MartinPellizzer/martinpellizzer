<p>Panicularia striata, commonly known as the striped panicled grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, panicle-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that are clustered in a branching pattern, giving it a feathery appearance. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue that helps it blend into its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Panicularia striata is often found in moist, open areas such as meadows and wetlands, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight.</p>
