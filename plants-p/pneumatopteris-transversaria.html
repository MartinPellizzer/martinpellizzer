                    <h1>Pneumatopteris transversaria</h1>
<p>Pneumatopteris transversaria, commonly known as the transverse water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately divided, with a distinctive transverse arrangement of the pinnae, which gives the plant its scientific name.</p>
