                    <h1>Pistacia × saportae var. oxycarpa</h1>
<p>Pistacia × saportae var. oxycarpa, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Pistacia vera and Pistacia lentiscus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that are highly aromatic. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, kidney-shaped nuts encased in a hard shell. It is native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia, thriving in arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a shade tree or for its medicinal and culinary uses.</p>
