<p>Pernettya phillyreifolia, commonly known as the dwarf cowberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of bright red berries. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its compact form and hardy nature make it an important component of cold-climate ecosystems.</p>
<p>Pernettya phillyreifolia plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds, through its fruit production.</p>
