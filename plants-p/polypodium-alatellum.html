<p>Polypodium alatellum, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often adorned with small, scale-like structures along the leaflets. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, thriving in humid climates. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread gradually over time.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a consistent green appearance throughout the year.</p>
