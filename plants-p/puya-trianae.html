                    <h1>Puya trianae</h1>
<p>Puya trianae, commonly known as the Queen of the Andes, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a towering plant that can grow up to 10 meters in height, featuring a rosette of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding structure at the center. The plant produces an inflorescence of bright red flowers that bloom only once in its lifetime, typically after several years of growth. Its unique structure and vibrant blooms make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture.</p>
<p>Puya trianae is also notable for its ability to survive in extreme environmental conditions, including high altitudes and cold temperatures.</p>
