<p>Papaver microcarpum subsp.</p>
<p>czekanowskii, commonly known as the Czekanowskii poppy, is a rare and diminutive member of the Papaveraceae family. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of red or orange, with a distinctive, saucer-shaped corolla.</p>
<p>The plant produces capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous regions, often in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
