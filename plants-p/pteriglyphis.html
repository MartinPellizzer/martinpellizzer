                    <h1>Pteriglyphis</h1>
<p>Pteriglyphis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's most distinctive feature is its pale, almost translucent flowers, which resemble ghostly apparitions. Pteriglyphis has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
