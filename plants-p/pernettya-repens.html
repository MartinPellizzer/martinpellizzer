<p>Pernettya repens, commonly known as trailing cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It produces small, red berries that are edible and often used in traditional foods. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves and a mat-forming growth habit, allowing it to thrive in harsh, cold climates. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can survive in rocky or sandy environments.</p>
<p>Pernettya repens plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native habitats.</p>
