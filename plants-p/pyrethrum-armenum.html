<p>Pyrethrum armenum, commonly known as Armenian pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers with white ray florets. The plant produces small, spherical seed heads that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Pyrethrum armenum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p>
