                    <h1>Platanthera bifolia var. microglossa</h1>
<p>Platanthera bifolia var. microglossa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to moist, shaded habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features a slender, erect stem with a basal rosette of linear leaves and produces a dense spike of pale green to white flowers. The plant is characterized by its reduced, narrow labellum, which distinguishes it from the typical variety. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
