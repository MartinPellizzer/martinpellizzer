                    <h1>Pneumatopteris pennigera</h1>
<p>Pneumatopteris pennigera, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has large, floating fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length, with a distinctive, lobed structure. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomes spread across the water surface, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The fronds are covered in tiny pores that aid in gas exchange, making it well adapted to its aquatic lifestyle.</p>
