                    <h1>Potentilla anserina var. grandis</h1>
<p>Potentilla anserina var. grandis, commonly known as the silverweed or silver saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
