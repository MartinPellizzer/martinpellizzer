                    <h1>Poa pekulnejensis</h1>
<p>Poa pekulnejensis, commonly known as the Pekulne grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, specifically in the departments of La Paz and Potos√≠ in Bolivia. This perennial grass is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats that help stabilize the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Poa pekulnejensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
