<p>Phaca plattensis, commonly known as the Plattens Island fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or partially emergent. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, producing spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Phaca plattensis is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
