<p>Paederotella pontica, commonly known as the Pontic marsh bug, is a species of aquatic insect found in freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hydrophilidae, which includes water beetles and their relatives. The plant is not a true plant but an insect, so it does not have botanical features in the traditional sense. However, it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, unpolluted water bodies.</p>
