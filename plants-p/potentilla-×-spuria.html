                    <h1>Potentilla × spuria</h1>
<p>Potentilla × spuria, commonly known as everlasting or Scotch heather, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant features herringbone-patterned leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, and the plant is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions.</p>
<p>Potentilla × spuria is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
