<p>Populus salicifolia, commonly known as the silky poplar or Canadian poplar, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. Its rapid growth rate makes it a common species in reforestation efforts.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5â€“10 centimeters in length and turn yellow in the fall.</p>
