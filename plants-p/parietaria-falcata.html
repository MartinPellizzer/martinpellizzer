<p>Parietaria falcata, commonly known as the narrowleaf wall-rue, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its hairy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Parietaria falcata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its leaves contain histamine, which can cause skin irritation upon contact, making it a common allergen in some regions.</p>
