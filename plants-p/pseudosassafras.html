                    <h1>Pseudosassafras</h1>
<p>Pseudosassafras, commonly known as false sassafras, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes other aromatic plants like cinnamon and avocado. The plant is characterized by its opposite, simple, elliptic leaves that are often glandular-dotted. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries.</p>
<p>The bark and leaves contain aromatic compounds, though they are not as potent as true sassafras.</p>
