<p>Phlegmariurus phylicifolius, commonly known as the sweet fern, is a species of clubmoss that thrives in moist, acidic soils.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, needle-like leaves that form dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain spores, typical of its vascular plant classification. It is often found in forest understories, particularly in temperate and boreal regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of certain ecosystems.</p>
