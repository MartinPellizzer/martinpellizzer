<p>Polypodium pectinatum var. brachypus, commonly known as the short-leaf wall fern, is a terrestrial fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit. The fronds are typically pinnately divided with a distinctive, leathery texture. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
