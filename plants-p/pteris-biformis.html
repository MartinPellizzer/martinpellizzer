                    <h1>Pteris biformis</h1>
<p>Pteris biformis, commonly known as the bipinnate water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are divided into two types of pinnaeâ€”some with a single segment and others with two. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of spore-bearing sorus.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Pteris biformis make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects.</p>
