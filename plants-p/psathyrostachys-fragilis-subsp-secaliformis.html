<p>Psathyrostachys fragilis subsp.</p>
<p>secaliformis, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish spikelets.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for forage and its genetic relationship to cultivated wheat species.</p>
