                    <h1>Pityrogramma</h1>
<p>Pityrogramma, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of small, aquatic or semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, floating fronds that are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The fronds are typically divided into small, finger-like segments, and the plants lack true roots, relying instead on rhizomes for anchorage. Pityrogramma species are often used in ornamental water gardens due to their aesthetic appeal and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>They play an important ecological role in maintaining water quality by absorbing excess nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
