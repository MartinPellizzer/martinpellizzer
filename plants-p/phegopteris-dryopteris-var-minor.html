                    <h1>Phegopteris dryopteris var. minor</h1>
<p>Phegopteris dryopteris var. minor, commonly known as the lesser cliff fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and woodland areas. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread and establish itself in suitable habitats. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a soft, feathery texture.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are typically covered by a protective indusium.</p>
