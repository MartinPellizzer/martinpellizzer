<p>Paronychia argentea var. mauritanica, commonly known as silverleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy and rocky soils. The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically silver-gray in color, covered in fine, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
