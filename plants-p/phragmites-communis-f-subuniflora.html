                    <h1>Phragmites communis f. subuniflora</h1>
<p>Phragmites communis f. subuniflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved common reed, is a variant of the common reed found in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, narrow leaves and reduced flowering structures compared to the typical form. This subspecies is often found in brackish or freshwater marshes, where it plays a key role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life. Its growth is influenced by water levels and salinity, making it adaptable to a range of wetland conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is also important for carbon sequestration and water filtration in wetland ecosystems.</p>
