                    <h1>Pedicularis thailandica</h1>
<p>Pedicularis thailandica, commonly known as the Thai monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to Thailand.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its specialized roots. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color, attracting specific pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
