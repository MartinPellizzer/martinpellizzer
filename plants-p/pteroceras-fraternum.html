                    <h1>Pteroceras fraternum</h1>
<p>Pteroceras fraternum, commonly known as the fraternum liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Pterobryaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thalloid structure with a green, flattened stem covered in tiny, leaf-like structures called phyllodes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its thallus.</p>
<p>Pteroceras fraternum is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem.</p>
