<p>Pilosella brachycoma subsp.</p>
<p>colluta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawk's-beard, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features basal and ascending stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat, disk-like head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its hairy foliage and compact growth habit make it well adapted to dry, rocky environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
