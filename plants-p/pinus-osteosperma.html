                    <h1>Pinus osteosperma</h1>
<p>Pinus osteosperma, commonly known as the desert bristlecone pine, is a resilient evergreen conifer native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slow growth rate and long lifespan, often living over 2,000 years. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Its cones are woody and contain small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The tree's bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and extreme temperatures.</p>
