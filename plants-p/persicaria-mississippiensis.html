<p>Persicaria mississippiensis, commonly known as the Mississippi polygon, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features upright stems that can grow up to 2 meters tall, covered with small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in late summer, which are borne on slender, branched inflorescences. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in swampy areas and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it an effective plant for erosion control in wetland environments.</p>
