                    <h1>Paspalum costatum</h1>
<p>Paspalum costatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf grass or coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in dunes, beaches, and coastal marshes.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize coastal soils, it plays an important ecological role in these environments.</p>
