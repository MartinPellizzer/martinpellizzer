<p>Pepinia pectinata, commonly known as the sticky peat moss, is a unique plant belonging to the family Ericaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spongy growth that forms mats on the forest floor, often in moist, acidic environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its roots are highly specialized, forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi to enhance nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Pepinia pectinata plays a vital role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats.</p>
