<p>Persica vulgaris var. sanguinea, commonly known as the blood-red peach.</p>
<p>This variant is characterized by its striking red-pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge.

Its foliage consists of alternate, ovate leaves with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The fruit, which ripens in late summer, is smaller and more intensely colored than typical peaches, with a sweet, aromatic flavor.</p>
