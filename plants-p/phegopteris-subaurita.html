<p>Phegopteris subaurita, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The fern's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important component of forest ecosystems.</p>
