                    <h1>Paepalanthus spiralis</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus spiralis, commonly known as the spiral cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spirally arranged, cylindrical stems that resemble twisted columns, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun.</p>
