<p>Pleopeltis griffithiana, commonly known as the Griffith's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
