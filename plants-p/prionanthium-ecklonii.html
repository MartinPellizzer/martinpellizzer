                    <h1>Prionanthium ecklonii</h1>
<p>Prionanthium ecklonii, commonly known as the Kauaʻi ʻohiʻa, is a rare endemic species native to the island of Kauaʻi in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant is adapted to the moist, shaded environments of rainforests and grows primarily in the wetter regions of the island. Due to habitat loss and competition from invasive species, it is considered critically endangered and is protected under conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of Hawaii's native flora and a symbol of the island's ecological diversity.</p>
