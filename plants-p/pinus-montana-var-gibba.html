                    <h1>Pinus montana var. gibba</h1>
<p>Pinus montana var. gibba, commonly known as the Alpine white pine, is a variant of the white pine species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its distinctive, elongated cones. The leaves are needle-like, typically measuring between 2 to 5 centimeters in length, and are arranged in spirals around the stem. This variety thrives in high-altitude environments, where it adapts to cold and harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Its cones are serotinous, meaning they remain closed until exposed to high temperatures, usually from forest fires, ensuring seed dispersal under favorable conditions.</p>
