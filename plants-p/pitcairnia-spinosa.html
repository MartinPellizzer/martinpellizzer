                    <h1>Pitcairnia spinosa</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia spinosa, commonly known as the spiny pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that can reach up to two meters in height. Its leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia spinosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and air-purifying properties.</p>
