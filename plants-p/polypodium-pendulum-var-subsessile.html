                    <h1>Polypodium pendulum var. subsessile</h1>
<p>Polypodium pendulum var. subsessile, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a variant of the common polypodium found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often pendulous, giving it a weeping appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, thriving in humid climates. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>The subsessile variant differs from the typical form by having shorter petioles, making it more compact in structure.</p>
