                    <h1>Pityrogramma xerophila</h1>
<p>Pityrogramma xerophila, commonly known as the desert water fern, is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive in drought conditions by entering a state of dormancy. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing moisture when available.</p>
<p>Pityrogramma xerophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing microhabitats for small organisms.</p>
