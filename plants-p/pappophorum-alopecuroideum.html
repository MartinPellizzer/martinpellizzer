                    <h1>Pappophorum alopecuroideum</h1>
<p>Pappophorum alopecuroideum, commonly known as the woolly grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, silky-haired leaves that give it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
