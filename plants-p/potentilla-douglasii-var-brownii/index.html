                            <h1>Potentilla Douglasii Var. Brownii</h1>
<p>Potentilla douglasii var. brownii is a rare and striking plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Known for its vibrant yellow flowers and compact growth habit, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and woodlands. This variety is a lesser-known cousin of the common Potentilla, often overlooked despite its ornamental value. Its unique coloration and resilience make it a favorite among native plant enthusiasts and gardeners. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
