                    <h1>Poa indigesta</h1>
<p>Poa indigesta, commonly known as the indigestible grass, is a species of grass native to the southern regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant is notable for its tough, fibrous leaves, which contribute to its name due to their difficulty in digestion by livestock. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
<p>However, its high silica content makes it less palatable and potentially harmful to grazing animals in large quantities.</p>
