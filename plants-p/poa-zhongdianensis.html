                    <h1>Poa zhongdianensis</h1>
<p>Poa zhongdianensis, commonly known as the Zhongdian bluegrass, is a species of grass native to the high-altitude regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences, which produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Poa zhongdianensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
