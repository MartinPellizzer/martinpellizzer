<p>Poa attenuata var. tshuensis, commonly known as the Tshuenski bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats that help stabilize soil. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is often hidden among the leaves, making it less conspicuous.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas with limited soil nutrients.</p>
