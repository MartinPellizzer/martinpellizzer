                    <h1>Picea asperata var. retroflexa</h1>
<p>Picea asperata var. retroflexa, commonly known as the retroflex spruce, is a variant of the asperata spruce, characterized by its unique cone and leaf morphology.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in parts of China and Nepal. The leaves are typically short, stiff, and covered with a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. Its cones are often pendulous and contain small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its distinctive appearance.</p>
