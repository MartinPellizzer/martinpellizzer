                    <h1>Polygonella lanceolata</h1>
<p>Polygonella lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf waterplantain, is a small, herbaceous plant native to moist environments in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants characterized by their distinctive leaf shapes and often smooth, succulent stems. The plant typically grows in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss, and it produces small, clustered flowers in late spring.</p>
<p>Polygonella lanceolata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
