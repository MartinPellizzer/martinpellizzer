<p>Pilosella bomanssonii, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant is distinguished by its dense, hairy foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Pilosella bomanssonii thrives in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms low-growing mats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology.</p>
