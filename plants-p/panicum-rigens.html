<p>Panicum rigens, commonly known as stiff panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has upright, slender stems that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered along the stem.</p>
<p>Panicum rigens is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
