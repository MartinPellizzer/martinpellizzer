<p>Panicum festucoides, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, slender flowering stalks that bear small, spike-like clusters of bracts. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
