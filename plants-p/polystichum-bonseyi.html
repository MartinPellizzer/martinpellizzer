<p>Polystichum bonseyi, commonly known as the Bonsey's sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a compact, upright structure.</p>
