<p>Paspalum pressum, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Paspalum pressum is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
