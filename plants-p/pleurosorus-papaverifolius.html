                    <h1>Pleurosorus papaverifolius</h1>
<p>Pleurosorus papaverifolius, commonly known as the papaver leaf fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the forests of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble the leaves of poppies, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on the trunks of trees or on rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
