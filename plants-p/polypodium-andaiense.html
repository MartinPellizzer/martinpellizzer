<p>Polypodium andaiense, commonly known as the Andean wall-r Fern, is a species of fern native to the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Polypodium andaiense plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for small organisms.</p>
