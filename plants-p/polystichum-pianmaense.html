<p>Polystichum pianmaense, commonly known as the Pianma fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
