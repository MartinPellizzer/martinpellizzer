                    <h1>Polystichum platypus</h1>
<p>Polystichum platypus, commonly known as the broad-leaf woodfern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a tall, upright rhizome with dark brown, fibrous roots and a dense crown of lance-shaped, leathery fronds. The fronds are typically divided into pinnate segments, with a distinctive, broad, and slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
