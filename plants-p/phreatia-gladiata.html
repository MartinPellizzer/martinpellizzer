<p>Phreatia gladiata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant lacks leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
