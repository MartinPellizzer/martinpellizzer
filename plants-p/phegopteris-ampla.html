<p>Phegopteris ampla, commonly known as the broad buckwheat fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that are often divided into smaller, lobed segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>The fronds are deciduous, turning a reddish-brown before falling in the autumn.</p>
