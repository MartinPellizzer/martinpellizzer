                    <h1>Pilopsis</h1>
<p>Pilopsis, commonly known as the hairy lichen, is a unique organism that belongs to the lichen group, which is a symbiotic association between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy or woolly appearance, which gives it its common name and helps in retaining moisture. Pilopsis thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks, tree trunks, or soil surfaces in temperate climates. The structure of Pilopsis consists of a thallus, which is the body of the lichen, covered in a layer of fungal hyphae and algal cells.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for environmental conditions and its ecological contribution to nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.</p>
