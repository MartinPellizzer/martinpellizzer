                    <h1>Poa adspersa</h1>
<p>Poa adspersa, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Poa adspersa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in low-light conditions makes it a common component of temperate grassland ecosystems.</p>
