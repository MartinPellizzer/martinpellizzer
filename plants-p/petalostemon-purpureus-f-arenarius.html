                    <h1>Petalostemon purpureus f. arenarius</h1>
<p>Petalostemon purpureus f. arenarius, commonly known as the sand petalostemon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, succulent-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are usually purple or violet, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of its stems. Its flowering period typically occurs during the cooler months, making it a valuable plant for ornamental and ecological purposes in xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The variety 'arenarius' is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preference compared to the typical form of Petalostemon purpureus.</p>
