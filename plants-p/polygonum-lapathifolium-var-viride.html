                    <h1>Polygonum lapathifolium var. viride</h1>
<p>Polygonum lapathifolium var. viride, commonly known as greenleaf smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright stems that are often reddish in color, with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green but can have a bluish or purplish tinge. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it both a weed and a valuable plant for erosion control.</p>
