                    <h1>Potentilla arenaria var. inhaerens</h1>
<p>Potentilla arenaria var. inhaerens, commonly known as the sand rose or coastal potentilla, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, salty environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, silvery-gray, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize sand dunes.</p>
