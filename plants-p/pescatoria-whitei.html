                    <h1>Pescatoria whitei</h1>
<p>Pescatoria whitei, commonly known as the white's pescatoria, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its delicate, white to pale yellow ray florets and compact, daisy-like flower heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions. Its flowering period occurs during the late summer to early autumn months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pescatoria whitei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
