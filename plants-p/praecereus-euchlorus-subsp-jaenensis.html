<p>Praecereus euchlorus subsp.</p>
<p>jaenensis, commonly known as the Jaenensis Cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Spain. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing transpiration.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and requires minimal water to survive.</p>
