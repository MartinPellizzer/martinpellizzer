<p>Polypodium leucosticton, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green fronds with a leathery texture and is characterized by its ability to form dense, low-growing mats. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium leucosticton is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a pioneer species in disturbed habitats.</p>
