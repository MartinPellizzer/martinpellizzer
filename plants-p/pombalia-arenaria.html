<p>Pombalia arenaria, commonly known as the sand pombalia, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent structure, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Pombalia arenaria is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to coastal dunes and rocky shores.</p>
