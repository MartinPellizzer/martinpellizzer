                    <h1>Polystichum × hakonense</h1>
<p>Polystichum × hakonense, commonly known as the Hakon's fern, is a hybrid evergreen fern native to Japan.</p>
<p>It features dark green, lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are dense and arching, giving it a lush, ornamental appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is well-suited for woodland gardens. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, typical of ferns, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>
