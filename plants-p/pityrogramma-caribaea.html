<p>Pityrogramma caribaea, commonly known as the Carib shield fern, is a member of the water fern family, Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a distinctive, shield-shaped frond with a thick, leathery texture. Its rhizome is short and produces a dense cluster of fertile and sterile fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
