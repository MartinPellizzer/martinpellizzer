                    <h1>Polystichum duthiei var. subbipinnatum</h1>
<p>Polystichum duthiei var. subbipinnatum, commonly known as the subbipinnate wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus Polystichum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnate fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually evergreen, with a dark green coloration and a leathery texture.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
