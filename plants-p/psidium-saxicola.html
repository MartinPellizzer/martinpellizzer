                    <h1>Psidium saxicola</h1>
<p>Psidium saxicola, commonly known as the rock guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or yellow when ripe, though they are often sour and not widely consumed. Psidium saxicola thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies in arid ecosystems.</p>
