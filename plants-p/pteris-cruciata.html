                    <h1>Pteris cruciata</h1>
<p>Pteris cruciata, commonly known as the cross fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into four parts, resembling a cross, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique feature makes Pteris cruciata not only visually striking but also ecologically significant.</p>
