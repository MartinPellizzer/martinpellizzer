                    <h1>Pachypodium enigmaticum</h1>
<p>Pachypodium enigmaticum, commonly known as the mysterious bottle tree, is a unique succulent native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, swollen stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant has small, sparsely distributed leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers during the dry season. Its distinctive appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of botanical interest.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
