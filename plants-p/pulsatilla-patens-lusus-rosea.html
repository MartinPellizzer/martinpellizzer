                    <h1>Pulsatilla patens lusus rosea</h1>
<p>Pulsatilla patens lusus rosea, commonly known as the roseate pasqueflower, is a rare and striking variant of the pasqueflower.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps. The plant features showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its foliage consists of basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, white down.</p>
<p>This botanical curiosity is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens.</p>
