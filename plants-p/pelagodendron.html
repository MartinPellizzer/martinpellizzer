                    <h1>Pelagodendron</h1>
<p>Pelagodendron, commonly known as the "sea pine," is a genus of ancient coniferous plants that thrived during the Late Cretaceous period.</p>
<p>These plants were characterized by their tall, tree-like structures and were likely adapted to coastal or swampy environments. Their fossils are often found in marine sediments, indicating they may have lived near the coast or in shallow seas. Pelagodendron had needle-like leaves and produced cones, similar to modern conifers.</p>
<p>The study of Pelagodendron provides valuable insights into the flora and ecosystems of the Mesozoic era.</p>
