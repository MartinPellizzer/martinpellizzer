<p>Polypodium subcapillare, commonly known as the small-hair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered with short, fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new fronds, allowing it to spread gradually over time.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
