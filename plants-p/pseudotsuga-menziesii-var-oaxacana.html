                    <h1>Pseudotsuga menziesii var. oaxacana</h1>
<p>Pseudotsuga menziesii var. oaxacana, commonly known as the Oaxacan hemlock, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the Sierra Madre del Sur in southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the pine family (Pinaceae) and is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high elevations, often in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
