                    <h1>Phleum arvense</h1>
<p>Phleum arvense, commonly known as field quackgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
