<p>Prosthechea papilio, commonly known as the papilio orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and the presence of aerial roots that help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive papilionaceous (butterfly-like) shape, often in shades of pink, purple, and white. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Prosthechea papilio is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in the understory of tropical rainforests.</p>
