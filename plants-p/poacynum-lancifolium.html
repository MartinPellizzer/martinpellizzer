                    <h1>Poacynum lancifolium</h1>
<p>Poacynum lancifolium, commonly known as the lancifoliate milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces toxic latex sap, which contains cardenolides similar to those found in other milkweeds. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in dry environments, making it an important species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Poacynum lancifolium is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
