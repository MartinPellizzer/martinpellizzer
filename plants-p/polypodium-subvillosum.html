<p>Polypodium subvillosum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Polypodium subvillosum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
