                    <h1>Phyllanthus mariannensis</h1>
<p>Phyllanthus mariannensis, commonly known as the Marian Islands spurge, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Ocean, particularly the Marshall Islands.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and disturbed soils, showing adaptability to saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, smooth, oval-shaped fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Phyllanthus mariannensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited geographic distribution.</p>
