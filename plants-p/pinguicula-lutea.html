<p>Pinguicula lutea, commonly known as the yellow butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Pinguicula lutea thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its unique ability to absorb nutrients through both photosynthesis and insect digestion makes it an intriguing subject in botanical studies.</p>
