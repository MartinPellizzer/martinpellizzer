                    <h1>Ptelea subvestita</h1>
<p>Ptelea subvestita, commonly known as the white-leafed hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale green bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some wildlife but generally unpalatable to humans. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Ptelea subvestita is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
