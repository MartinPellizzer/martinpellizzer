                    <h1>Pongamia dehiscens</h1>
<p>Pongamia dehiscens, commonly known as the Indian beech, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Leguminosae (Fabaceae) and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits that split open when mature. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood and its potential in phytoremediation due to its tolerance of heavy metals.</p>
