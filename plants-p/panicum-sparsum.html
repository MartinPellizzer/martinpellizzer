<p>Panicum sparsum, commonly known as scattered panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, sandy soils, and disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Panicum sparsum is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
