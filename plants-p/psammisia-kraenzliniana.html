                    <h1>Psammisia kraenzliniana</h1>
<p>Psammisia kraenzliniana, commonly known as the sand dune spurge, is a perennial herb native to sandy coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the warmer months, which are followed by bead-like, greenish fruits. It is well adapted to arid and saline environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Psammisia kraenzliniana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
