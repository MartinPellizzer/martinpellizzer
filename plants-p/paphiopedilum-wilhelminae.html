<p>Paphiopedilum wilhelminae, commonly known as the Wilhelmine's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>

Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its often humid and shaded environment.</p>
<p>The species is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and rarity, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
