                    <h1>Pyrus detergibilis</h1>
<p>Pyrus detergibilis, commonly known as the cleansing pear, is a rare species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its deciduous nature, producing small, green leaves and white flowers in early spring. The plant's fruit, which resembles a pear, is known for its mild detergent properties due to the presence of saponins. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cold climate to complete its annual growth cycle.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique chemical composition, it is of interest to botanists and researchers.</p>
