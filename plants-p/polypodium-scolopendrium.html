<p>Polypodium scolopendrium, commonly known as the hart's tongue fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow, leathery fronds that resemble the tongue of a hart, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in small, round structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The hart's tongue fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in shaded garden settings.</p>
