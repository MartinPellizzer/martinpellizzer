                    <h1>Pedicularis provotii</h1>
<p>Pedicularis provotii, commonly known as the Tibetan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually bright red or orange, with a distinctive two-lipped structure, and it blooms during the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
