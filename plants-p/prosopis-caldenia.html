<p>Prosopis caldenia, commonly known as the Jerusalem tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, deciduous leaves that are typically reduced to spines. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which attract various pollinators. Its seeds are encased in fibrous pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Prosopis caldenia is well adapted to harsh, saline soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert environments.</p>
