                    <h1>Pitcairnia angustifolia</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage, which forms a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, often in shades of red or orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is popular in horticulture but is also threatened by habitat loss.</p>
