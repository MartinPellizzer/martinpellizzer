                    <h1>Phegopteris montbrisoniana</h1>
<p>Phegopteris montbrisoniana, commonly known as the Montbrison fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other members of the genus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its rhizomes are relatively short and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it in its habitat.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile fronds in the second.</p>
