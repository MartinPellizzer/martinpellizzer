                    <h1>Posidonia australis</h1>
<p>Posidonia australis, commonly known as Australian seagrass, is a marine flowering plant found in shallow coastal waters of the southern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It forms dense underwater meadows that stabilize sediments and improve water clarity. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. It reproduces both sexually through seeds and asexually via rhizomes, which allow it to spread across the seafloor.</p>
<p>Posidonia australis plays a vital role in supporting marine biodiversity and carbon sequestration.</p>
