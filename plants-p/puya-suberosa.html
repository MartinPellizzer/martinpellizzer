<p>Puya suberosa, commonly known as the Chilean torchflower, is a striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of Chile.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that resembles a torch. The plant produces vibrant red and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
