<p>Pseudostenosiphonium jogense, commonly known as the Jogese swamp fern, is a rare aquatic fern found in specific wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It possesses delicate, ribbon-like fronds that float on the water's surface, adapted to its aquatic environment. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater systems with high humidity and nutrient-rich substrates. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, relying on spore dispersal for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat degradation, it is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
