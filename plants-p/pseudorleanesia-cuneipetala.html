<p>Pseudorleanesia cuneipetala, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pseudorleanesia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under forest canopies, and has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its botanical features include a woody stem, alternate leaves, and small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research.</p>
