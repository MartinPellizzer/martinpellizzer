<p>Pandanus decus-montium, commonly known as the mountain pandanus, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a tall, slender palm-like plant with long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by fibrous, spiky fruits. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and for thatching, while the plant itself thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight.</p>
<p>Pandanus decus-montium is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
