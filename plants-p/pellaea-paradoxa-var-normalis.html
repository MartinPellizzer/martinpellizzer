                    <h1>Pellaea paradoxa var. normalis</h1>
<p>Pellaea paradoxa var. normalis, commonly known as the paradox fern, is a rare and unique species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, evergreen fronds that remain green throughout the year, unlike most ferns. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with tightly clustered, fan-shaped leaves that are typically bright green. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common trait among ferns.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments, making it a sought-after plant in botanical gardens.</p>
