<p>Paspalum macrophyllum var. piliferum, commonly known as the hairy paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland habitats, including marshes and swampy areas, and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil in moist environments.</p>
