<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are usually red or yellow, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Botanically, Paramochloa effusa is notable for its ability to derive some of its nutrients from its host while also performing photosynthesis.</p>
