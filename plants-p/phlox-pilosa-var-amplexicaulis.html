                    <h1>Phlox pilosa var. amplexicaulis</h1>
<p>Phlox pilosa var. amplexicaulis, commonly known as the woolly phlox or creeping phlox, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, soft, gray-green foliage covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in partial shade make it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover.</p>
<p>The varietal form *amplexicaulis* is distinguished by its leaves that partially encircle the stems, giving it a unique, creeping appearance.</p>
