<p>Poa supina f. alpigena, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, mat-forming structure, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly curled, adapting to cold and windy conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance in alpine ecosystems.</p>
