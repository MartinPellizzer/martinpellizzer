                    <h1>Polystichum ocellatum</h1>
<p>Polystichum ocellatum, commonly known as the spotted wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, bipinnate fronds that are adorned with distinctive white or yellow spots, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland ecosystems.</p>
