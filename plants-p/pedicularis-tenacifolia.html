                    <h1>Pedicularis tenacifolia</h1>
<p>Pedicularis tenacifolia, commonly known as the sticky-petaled lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly referred to as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. Its leaves are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps in trapping small insects.</p>
<p>The flowers, typically red or orange, bloom in late spring to early summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
