                    <h1>Phoradendron calvinii</h1>
<p>Phoradendron calvinii, commonly known as the Calvin's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it produces its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>The species is also notable for its ability to form dense clusters on its host, contributing to the ecological dynamics of forest ecosystems.</p>
