                    <h1>Prasophyllum intricatum</h1>
<p>Prasophyllum intricatum, commonly known as the intricate leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the southern regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils, often in heathland or woodland habitats. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and bears a single, slender flower spike with small, pale green to white flowers. It is a perennial species that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is common among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and land clearing.</p>
