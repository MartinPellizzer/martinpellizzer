<p>Pinus tetragona, commonly known as the quadrifida pine, is a species of conifer native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, stout needles that are arranged in four rows around the stem, giving it its scientific name. The tree typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as mountainous regions, where it forms dense, wind-resistant stands. Its cones are relatively small and often remain closed for many years before opening to release seeds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
