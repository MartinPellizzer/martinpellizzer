<p>Phaeanthus andamancnsis, commonly known as the Andaman star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the Andaman Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its strikingly beautiful, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the tropical rainforest canopy. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
