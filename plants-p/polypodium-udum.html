<p>Polypodium udum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that give it its common name, and it typically grows on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant has a compact growth habit with small, ovate leaves that are densely packed along the rhizome.
