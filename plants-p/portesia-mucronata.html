                    <h1>Portesia mucronata</h1>
<p>Portesia mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hard, dense wood and lanceolate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but threatened species in its native habitat.</p>
