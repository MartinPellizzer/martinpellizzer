                    <h1>Pellaea limitanea var. mexicana</h1>
<p>Pellaea limitanea var. mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican cliff fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, limestone-rich environments, often growing on cliff faces or in crevices where moisture is retained. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
