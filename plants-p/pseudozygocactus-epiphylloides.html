<p>Pseudozygocactus epiphylloides, commonly known as the leaf cactus, is a unique epiphytic cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, leaf-like stems that are green and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding ornamental value. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is a popular choice for experienced cactus enthusiasts.</p>
