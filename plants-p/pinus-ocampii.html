                    <h1>Pinus ocampii</h1>
<p>Pinus ocampii, commonly known as Ocampo's pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, straight trunk and long, needle-like leaves arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain seeds enclosed in winged structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
