                    <h1>Palma cocos</h1>
<p>Palma cocos, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces an oval-shaped fruit, known as a coconut, which contains both water and a white, fleshy pulp. The coconut palm is highly valued for its economic and nutritional contributions, including coconut milk, oil, and copra.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in coastal and tropical climates makes it a significant part of many island ecosystems.</p>
