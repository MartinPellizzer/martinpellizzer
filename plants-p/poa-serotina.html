                    <h1>Poa serotina</h1>
<p>Poa serotina, commonly known as late blackgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces slender, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can become a weed in agricultural settings, though it also plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting biodiversity.</p>
