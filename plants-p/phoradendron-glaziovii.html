                    <h1>Phoradendron glaziovii</h1>
<p>Phoradendron glaziovii, commonly known as the Glaziov's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It attaches to the branches of host trees, such as ceiba and mahogany, using a specialized root system called a haustellum to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
