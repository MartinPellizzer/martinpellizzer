<p>Polystichum guangxiense, commonly known as Guangxi shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to southern China, particularly Guangxi Province.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its densely packed, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically upright and shield-shaped. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in lines along the veins.</p>
<p>Polystichum guangxiense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage.</p>
