<p>Phaenixopus, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features upright, branching stems covered in soft, hairy foliage that turns a striking golden hue in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Phaenixopus is well-suited for moist, partially shaded environments and is often used in native plant gardens.</p>
