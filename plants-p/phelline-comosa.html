<p>Phelline comosa, commonly known as the woolly phelline, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which helps to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple branches forming a compact shape.</p>
<p>Phelline comosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in regions with low rainfall.</p>
