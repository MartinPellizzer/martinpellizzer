<p>Paepalanthus niveus, commonly known as the white-veined cactoid, is a unique plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure. The plant produces striking white or pale blue flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Paepalanthus niveus is adapted to high-altitude conditions and thrives in cool, shaded environments.</p>
