                    <h1>Pteris taiwanensis</h1>
<p>Pteris taiwanensis, commonly known as the Taiwan water fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, particularly Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sori and indusia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Pteris taiwanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
