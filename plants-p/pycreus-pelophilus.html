                    <h1>Pycreus pelophilus</h1>
<p>Pycreus pelophilus, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and clusters of yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance, aiding in their dispersal by birds. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing some photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Pycreus pelophilus is often found in temperate and subtropical regions, where it thrives in sunny, open habitats.</p>
