                    <h1>Puffia</h1>
<p>Puffia, commonly known as the "puffball mushroom," is a type of fungi, not a plant, and therefore does not have botanical aspects in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Agaricaceae and is characterized by its round, dense, spore-filled fruiting body. Unlike plants, puffia lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It reproduces through spores released from the surface of its mature fruiting body.</p>
<p>Puffia is often found in grassy areas and can be mistaken for edible mushrooms, though some species are toxic.</p>
