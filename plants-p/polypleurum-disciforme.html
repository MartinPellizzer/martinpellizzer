<p>Polypleurum disciforme, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, and often leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help anchor it to its substrate and absorb nutrients.</p>
