<p>Pyrethrum myriophyllum var. subvirescens, commonly known as water chervil, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow waters and damp soils, featuring slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, helping to stabilize aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to improve water quality and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
