                    <h1>Pleopeltis rupestris var. nigricans</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis rupestris var. nigricans, commonly known as the black-stemmed rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that often have a distinctly serrated or toothed margin. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to anchor firmly in crevices.</p>
<p>The varietal name "nigricans" refers to its dark-colored stems, which contrast with the lighter color of its fronds.</p>
