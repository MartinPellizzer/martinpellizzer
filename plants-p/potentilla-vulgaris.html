                    <h1>Potentilla vulgaris</h1>
<p>Potentilla vulgaris, commonly known as common cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring wiry stems and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and can spread aggressively, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed.</p>
<p>Potentilla vulgaris is often found in dry soils, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas, thriving in full sun.</p>
