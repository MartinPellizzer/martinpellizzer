                    <h1>Polystemma mirandae</h1>
<p>Polystemma mirandae, commonly known as the Miranda's polystemma, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polystichaceae family and is characterized by its fern-like appearance with delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polystemma mirandae is considered a botanically significant and ecologically vulnerable species.</p>
