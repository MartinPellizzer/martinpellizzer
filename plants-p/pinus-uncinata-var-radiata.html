                    <h1>Pinus uncinata var. radiata</h1>
<p>Pinus uncinata var. radiata, commonly known as the radiata pine, is a variant of the serotinous pine native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically arranged in bundles of two, and its distinctive cone structure. The tree produces cones that remain closed until triggered by fire or extreme heat, a trait known as serotiny. Radiata pine is valued for its rapid growth and strong, durable wood, making it an important species in forestry.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to dry, rocky environments where it thrives.</p>
