                    <h1>Polycarena gracilipes</h1>
<p>Polycarena gracilipes, commonly known as the slender spiral liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped thallus that often forms dense mats on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead consists of a single, undifferentiated body called a thallus. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Polycarena gracilipes is typically found in humid environments such as forests, rock crevices, and wetlands, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
