<p>Polypodium macrorhynchum, commonly known as the large-fruit fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
