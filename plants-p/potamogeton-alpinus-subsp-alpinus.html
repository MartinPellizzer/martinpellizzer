<p>Potamogeton alpinus subsp.</p>
<p>alpinus, commonly known as alpine pondweed, is a perennial aquatic plant native to cold, freshwater environments. It typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found in mountain lakes and streams. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in cold climates makes it a key indicator species for alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
