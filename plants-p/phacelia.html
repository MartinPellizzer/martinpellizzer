                    <h1>Phacelia</h1>
<p>Phacelia, commonly known as blueweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their showy, often blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Phacelia species are typically annual or biennial herbs with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. They are native to North America and parts of the Mediterranean, and many species are used in ecological restoration due to their rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen.</p>
<p>The genus includes over 100 species, many of which are cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
