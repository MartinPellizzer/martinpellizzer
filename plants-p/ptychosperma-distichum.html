<p>Ptychosperma distichum, commonly known as the double-leaf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive two-ranked leaves, which give it its common name, and its stout, unbranched trunk. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts.</p>
