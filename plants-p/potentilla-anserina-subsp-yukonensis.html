<p>Potentilla anserina subsp.</p>
<p>yukonensis, commonly known as Yukon silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arctic and alpine regions of North America. It features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Yukon silverweed is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging conditions.</p>
