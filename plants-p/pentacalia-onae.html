<p>Pentacalia onae, commonly known as the Hawaiian pentacalia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Oahu in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers arranged in compact inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pentacalia onae is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
