<p>Poa uruguayensis, commonly known as the Uruguay grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, spikelet-bearing flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a bluish-green hue, which helps it to retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Poa uruguayensis is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
