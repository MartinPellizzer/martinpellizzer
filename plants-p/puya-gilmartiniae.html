                    <h1>Puya gilmartiniae</h1>
<p>Puya gilmartiniae, commonly known as the Gilmartin's torch, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean highlands of South America.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height, adorned with vibrant red and orange bracts. The leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette formation, forming a water-holding structure typical of bromeliads. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Puya gilmartiniae is notable for its longevity, often living for several decades before flowering and dying.</p>
