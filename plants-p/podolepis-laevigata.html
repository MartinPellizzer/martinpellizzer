<p>Podolepis laevigata, commonly known as the smoothleaf podolepis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Proteaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in fynbos vegetation. The plant is characterized by its smooth, narrow leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink.
