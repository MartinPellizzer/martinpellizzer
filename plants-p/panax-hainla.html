                    <h1>Panax hainla</h1>
<p>Panax hainla, commonly known as the Hainan ginseng, is a rare and valuable plant native to the Hainan Island in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy roots that are highly prized in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it thrives in the understory of dense vegetation. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a smooth texture and a deep green color, while its flowers are small and greenish-white in color.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Panax hainla is now considered an endangered species.</p>
