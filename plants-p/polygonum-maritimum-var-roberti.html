                    <h1>Polygonum maritimum var. roberti</h1>
<p>Polygonum maritimum var. roberti, commonly known as the coastal knotweed, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense colonies. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on elongated peduncles. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in saline environments.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to sandy or muddy shores, demonstrating resilience to salt spray and tidal fluctuations.</p>
