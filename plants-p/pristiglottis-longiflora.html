                    <h1>Pristiglottis longiflora</h1>
<p>Pristiglottis longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria that attach to the host. It is native to New Zealand and is often found in forested areas where its host trees thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
