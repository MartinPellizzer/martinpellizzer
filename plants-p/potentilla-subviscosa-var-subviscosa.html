<p>Potentilla subviscosa var. subviscosa, commonly known as sticky cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture.

It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other damp habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
