<p>Platanthera arcuata, commonly known as the curved-leaf twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and swamps.</p>
<p>Platanthera arcuata is also a rare and endangered species, requiring specific environmental conditions for successful growth.</p>
