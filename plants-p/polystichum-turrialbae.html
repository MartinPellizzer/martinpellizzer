                    <h1>Polystichum turrialbae</h1>
<p>Polystichum turrialbae, commonly known as the Turrialba holly fern, is a species of fern native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded gardens.</p>
