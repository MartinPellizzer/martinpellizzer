                    <h1>Poa todarii</h1>
<p>Poa todarii, commonly known as the Todarai grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, Poa todarii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
