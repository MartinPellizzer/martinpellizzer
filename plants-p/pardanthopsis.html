                    <h1>Pardanthopsis</h1>
<p>Pardanthopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale greenish-white flowers and lacks leaves, relying entirely on its roots for survival. Native to the wetlands and swamps of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
