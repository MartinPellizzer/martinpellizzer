<p>Pinus massoniana subsp.</p>
<p>wulingensis, commonly known as the Wuling fir, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to central China. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically longer than those of other pine species.</p>
<p>The cones of this subspecies are small and usually hang downward, containing two to three seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions, often at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for both ecological and conservation studies.</p>
