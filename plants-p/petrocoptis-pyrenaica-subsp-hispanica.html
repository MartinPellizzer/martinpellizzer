<p>Petrocoptis pyrenaica subsp.</p>
<p>hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish rockfoil, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, orbicular leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, limestone-rich soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
