<p>Psilocarphus caulescens, commonly known as the slender-stemmed psilocarphus, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Violaceae, which includes violets and related genera. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>While not psychoactive like some other members of the Psilocybe genus, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche.</p>
