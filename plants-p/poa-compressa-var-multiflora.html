<p>Poa compressa var. multiflora, commonly known as the multiflora bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its fine texture and adaptability, it is sometimes used in turfgrass mixes for its aesthetic and functional qualities.</p>
