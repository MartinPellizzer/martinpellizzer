                    <h1>Psammotropha androsacea var. enervis</h1>
<p>Psammotropha androsacea var. enervis, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its reduced leaf structure compared to the typical form, giving it a more delicate appearance.</p>
