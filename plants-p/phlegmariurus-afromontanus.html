                    <h1>Phlegmariurus afromontanus</h1>
<p>Phlegmariurus afromontanus, commonly known as the African mountain moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a cryptogamic plant characterized by its thalloid structure, which consists of a flat, leaf-like body that lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions of Africa. It plays a vital role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed forest ecosystems.</p>
