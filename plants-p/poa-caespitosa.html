<p>Poa caespitosa, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It forms dense, tussock-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Poa caespitosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone regions.</p>
