<p>Polybotrya flabellata, commonly known as the fan-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fan-shaped fronds that are often adorned with fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
