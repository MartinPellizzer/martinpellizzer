                    <h1>Pisum</h1>
<p>Pisum, commonly known as the pea, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that help it attach to supports. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often consumed as food. Pisum species are known for their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in their root nodules.</p>
<p>This makes them valuable in crop rotation and soil enrichment.</p>
