                    <h1>Polypleurum insulare</h1>
<p>Polypleurum insulare, commonly known as the island polypody, is a small evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the substrate.</p>
<p>The leaves are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, glossy appearance that helps it thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
