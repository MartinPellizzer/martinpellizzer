                    <h1>Pteracanthus inflatus</h1>
<p>Pteracanthus inflatus, commonly known as the inflated bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the order Santales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, sac-like structures that float on the water's surface, aiding in buoyancy and gas exchange. These structures are specialized for trapping small aquatic organisms, which the plant then absorbs for nutrients. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studying aquatic plant adaptations and ecological interactions.</p>
