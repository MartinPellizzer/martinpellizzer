                    <h1>Plectronia medusula</h1>
<p>Plectronia medusula, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a short, slender stem and lacks true leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its low reproductive rate, Plectronia medusula is critically endangered and highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
