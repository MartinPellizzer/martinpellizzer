                    <h1>Puya dichroa</h1>
<p>Puya dichroa, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking member of the bromeliad family native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 6 meters in height, adorned with vibrant red and orange bracts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects and birds. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and form a rosette at the base, which helps collect water in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Puya dichroa is known for its slow growth and long flowering period, making it a unique and dramatic addition to botanical gardens.</p>
