                    <h1>Polysphaeria lanceolata var. pedata</h1>
<p>Polysphaeria lanceolata var. pedata, commonly known as the creeping marsh fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist soils. The plant has feather-like, pinnately compound leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are borne in spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and its ability to thrive in water-saturated environments.</p>
