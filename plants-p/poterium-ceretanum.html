                    <h1>Poterium ceretanum</h1>
<p>Poterium ceretanum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Poterium ceretanum is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been traditionally used in carving and furniture making.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as a vulnerable species.</p>
