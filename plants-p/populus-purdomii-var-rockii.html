                    <h1>Populus purdomii var. rockii</h1>
<p>Populus purdomii var. rockii, commonly known as the Rockii poplar, is a rare and specialized variant of the Populus genus native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. This species thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils and alpine meadows. Its floral structure includes small, catkin-like flowers that are wind-pollinated, a common trait among poplar species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
