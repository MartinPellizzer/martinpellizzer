                    <h1>Pentapogon parvus</h1>
<p>Pentapogon parvus, commonly known as the small-headed grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of fine, grass-like leaves that are often less than 10 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat.</p>
