                    <h1>Plectronia dubiosa</h1>
<p>Plectronia dubiosa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom infrequently, making it a sought-after species among botanists and horticulturists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and its elusive nature, Plectronia dubiosa is considered critically endangered in the wild.</p>
