<p>Pasania kuarunensis, commonly known as the Kuarun sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a dense mat of silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers during the cooler months, typically from spring to autumn. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists in the region.</p>
