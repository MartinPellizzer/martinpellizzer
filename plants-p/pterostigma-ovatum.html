<p>Pterostigma ovatum, commonly known as the white-veined fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often light green with a distinct white midrib. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, creating a lacy appearance.</p>
<p>Pterostigma ovatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
