                    <h1>Poa teretifolia</h1>
<p>Poa teretifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly rolled. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens or used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
