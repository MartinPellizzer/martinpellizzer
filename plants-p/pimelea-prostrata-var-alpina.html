                    <h1>Pimelea prostrata var. alpina</h1>
<p>Pimelea prostrata var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine mistflower, is a low-growing shrub native to the alpine regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to rocky or sandy soils. The plant has wiry, prostrate stems that form a mat-like structure, helping it withstand harsh alpine conditions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss in cold, windy environments.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to high altitudes and is often found in open heathlands or on rocky outcrops.</p>
