                    <h1>Poa minuta</h1>
<p>Poa minuta, commonly known as dwarf mountain grass, is a small, perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Poa minuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens.</p>
