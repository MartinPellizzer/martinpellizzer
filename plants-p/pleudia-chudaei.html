<p>Pleudia chudaei, commonly known as the Chudaei pleudia, is a rare and elusive plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pleuridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it has a short growth cycle, flowering and setting seed within a few weeks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pleudia chudaei is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
