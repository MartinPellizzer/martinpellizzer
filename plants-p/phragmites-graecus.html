<p>Phragmites graecus, commonly known as the Greek reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the genus Phragmites. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, which can impact local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes are robust and allow it to spread aggressively through vegetative propagation.</p>
