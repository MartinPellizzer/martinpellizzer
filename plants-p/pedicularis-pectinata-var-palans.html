                    <h1>Pedicularis pectinata var. palans</h1>
<p>Pedicularis pectinata var. palans, commonly known as the Palan's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy structures, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its specific morphological traits and geographic distribution within the broader Pedicularis species.</p>
