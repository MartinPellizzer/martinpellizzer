                    <h1>Pleioceras orientale</h1>
<p>Pleioceras orientale, commonly known as the oriental pleioceras, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a compact, herbaceous growth habit. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pleioceras orientale is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
