<p>Psammogeton canescens subsp.</p>
<p>buschirensis, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and grayish-green foliage with a rough texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often found in desert margins and is used in some regions for forage or soil stabilization.</p>
