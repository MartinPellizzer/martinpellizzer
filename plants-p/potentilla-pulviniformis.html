                    <h1>Potentilla pulviniformis</h1>
<p>Potentilla pulviniformis, commonly known as the cushion potentilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with rocky or gravelly conditions.</p>
