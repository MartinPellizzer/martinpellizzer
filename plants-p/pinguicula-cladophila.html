                    <h1>Pinguicula cladophila</h1>
<p>Pinguicula cladophila, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rosette-like leaves that form a dense cluster, which helps in trapping prey. The plant produces delicate, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as wetlands and bogs.</p>
<p>Its botanical features are adapted for both photosynthesis and insect capture, making it a unique example of carnivorous plant evolution.</p>
