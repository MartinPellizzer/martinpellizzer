<p>Ptilotus rotundifolius, commonly known as the "desert lily," is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces striking pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in hard, spiky capsules that open explosively when mature, dispersing seeds over a short distance.</p>
<p>Ptilotus rotundifolius is adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in harsh climates.</p>
