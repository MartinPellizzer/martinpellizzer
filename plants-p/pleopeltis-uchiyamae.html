<p>Pleopeltis uchiyamae, commonly known as the Uchiyama's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that often grow on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with numerous roots that anchor it to its substrate. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
