<p>Peucedanum oreoselinum subsp.</p>
<p>bourgaei, commonly known as the Corsican angelica, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica, and thrives in moist, calcareous soils.</p>
<p>The plant features large, pinnately compound leaves with a strong, licorice-like scent, and its flowers are typically white or pale green. It is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
