<p>Poa paiktusanii, commonly known as the Tien Shan bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Poa paiktusanii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
