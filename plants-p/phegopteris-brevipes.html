<p>Phegopteris brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions near streams or in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.</p>
