                    <h1>Pinguicula pilosa</h1>
<p>Pinguicula pilosa, commonly known as the hairy butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves that trap small insects for nourishment. The plant typically grows in moist, boggy habitats where it can thrive on nutrient-poor soil. Its hairy texture helps to reduce water loss and provides a tactile feature for identification.</p>
<p>Pinguicula pilosa is often cultivated for its unique appearance and ecological interest.</p>
