<p>Picris macrantha, commonly known as the tall yellow gentian, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a nectar source for pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
