                    <h1>Platanthera gigantea var. doctersii</h1>
<p>Platanthera gigantea var. doctersii, commonly known as the Docters' ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and striking, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and filtered sunlight, to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and other threats, it is critically endangered and protected in many areas.</p>
