                    <h1>Physalis viscida</h1>
<p>Physalis viscida, commonly known as the sticky physalis, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its sticky texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into inflated, orange-red capsules, which encase the seeds. Its foliage is often covered in fine, sticky hairs that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Physalis viscida is often found in disturbed habitats and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny environments.</p>
