<p>Ptilotrichum, commonly known as the silky grass or silky sedge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. They typically grow in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Ptilotrichum species often have a dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps them thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>The genus is found primarily in the Americas, with some species extending into parts of Asia.</p>
