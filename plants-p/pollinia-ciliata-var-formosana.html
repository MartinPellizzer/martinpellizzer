                    <h1>Pollinia ciliata var. formosana</h1>
<p>Pollinia ciliata var. formosana, commonly known as the Formosan silky pollinia, is a rare variant of the silky pollinia species native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated pollinia that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which aid in pollen adhesion to insect vectors. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it thrives in the understory of subtropical and temperate forests. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
