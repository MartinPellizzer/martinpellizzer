                    <h1>Populus × plantierensis</h1>
<p>Populus × plantierensis, commonly known as the hybrid poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between *Populus deltoides* and *Populus balsamifera*. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and its ability to grow rapidly, making it a common choice for reforestation and ornamental purposes. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Populus × plantierensis is also notable for its role in phytoremediation, as it can absorb pollutants from the soil.</p>
