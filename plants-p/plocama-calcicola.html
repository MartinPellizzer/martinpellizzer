<p>Plocama calcicola, commonly known as the limestone plocama, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, limestone-rich soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It is often found in open habitats such as cliffs, slopes, and gravelly areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Plocama calcicola is considered a sensitive species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
