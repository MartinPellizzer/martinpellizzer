<p>Pinguicula campanulata, commonly known as the bell-shaped butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces a single, bell-shaped flower that is typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous habits make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
