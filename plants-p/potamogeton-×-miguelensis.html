                    <h1>Potamogeton × miguelensis</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × miguelensis, commonly known as the hybrid water milfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Potamogeton crispus and Potamogeton natans, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it can impact water quality and aquatic biodiversity.</p>
