                    <h1>Poa alpigena var. iantha</h1>
<p>Poa alpigena var. iantha, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant in gardens with similar environmental conditions.</p>
