<p>Platanthera glossophora, commonly known as the glossy lips orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a slender, erect stem with a single, showy flower that has a distinctive, lip-like structure. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It blooms in late summer, producing a pale yellow to greenish-white flower with a darkened lip.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
