<p>Cape honeysuckle, scientifically known as Paraspalathus capitata, is a vibrant flowering plant native to South Africa. It is prized for its striking orange-red blooms that appear in clusters during the summer months. This evergreen shrub is commonly used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and long-lasting flowers. Its ability to thrive in full sun makes it a popular choice for coastal and tropical landscapes. Despite its beauty, it requires well-drained soil and regular watering to flourish.</p>
