<p>Polygonum amphibium f. simile, commonly known as the marsh knotweed, is a variant of the common knotgrass.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its upright stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that appear in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots and rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in wetland habitats.</p>
