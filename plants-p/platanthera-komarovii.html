                    <h1>Platanthera komarovii</h1>
<p>Platanthera komarovii, commonly known as the Komarov's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense spike of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. It has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
