                    <h1>Platanthera saprophytica</h1>
<p>Platanthera saprophytica, commonly known as the saprophytic lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species that lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>It is found in moist, shaded forest habitats, typically in areas with rich organic soil. The plant produces a dense, dark green to brownish inflorescence composed of numerous small, white or pale green flowers. Its reproductive strategy involves pollination by specific insects, such as flies and beetles.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
