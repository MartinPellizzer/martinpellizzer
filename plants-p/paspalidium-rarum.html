<p>Paspalidium rarum, commonly known as the rare grass or slender paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, exhibiting a clump-forming growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
