                            <h1>Populus Alba Subsp. Canescens</h1>
<p>White poplar, scientifically known as Populus alba subsp. canescens, is a hardy and versatile tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its white, fuzzy undersides on its leaves and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This species is often found along riverbanks and in disturbed areas due to its strong root system and rapid growth. Its bark is smooth and gray, with flaky patches that peel away easily. The white poplar plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and improving soil stability in its natural habitat.</p>
