                    <h1>Polybotrya filiculifolia</h1>
<p>Polybotrya filiculifolia, commonly known as the feather-leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a richly branched thallus with a distinctive, leaf-like structure that resembles fern fronds. The plant's vegetative body is composed of a symbiotic association between algae and fungi, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the substrate. It is typically found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forest regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and unique morphology make it an important indicator species for environmental health.</p>
