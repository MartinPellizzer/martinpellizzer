<p>Polypodium tweedieanum, commonly known as the Tweedie's cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rock faces or in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to tolerate poor soil conditions makes it an important component of certain ecosystems.</p>
