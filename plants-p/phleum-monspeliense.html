                    <h1>Phleum monspeliense</h1>
<p>Phleum monspeliense, commonly known as mountain fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to bluish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray coloration that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Phleum monspeliense is often found in rocky or mountainous areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
