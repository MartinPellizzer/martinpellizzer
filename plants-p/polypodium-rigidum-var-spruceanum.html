<p>Polypodium rigidum var. spruceanum, commonly known as the hard fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rigid, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a serrated or toothed margin. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
