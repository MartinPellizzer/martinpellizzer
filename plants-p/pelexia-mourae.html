                    <h1>Pelexia mourae</h1>
<p>Pelexia mourae, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a striking aquatic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves that radiate from a central stem. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental water gardens.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in non-native environments if not properly managed.</p>
