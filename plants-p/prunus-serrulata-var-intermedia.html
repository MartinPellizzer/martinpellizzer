                    <h1>Prunus serrulata var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Prunus serrulata var. intermedia, commonly known as the Japanese cherry blossom, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, making it a symbol of transience and renewal in Japanese culture. The plant has ovate to elliptical leaves with serrated edges, which give it its scientific name. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, often growing in woodland or along streambanks.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the more famous Prunus serrulata, but it has a more compact growth habit and earlier blooming period.</p>
