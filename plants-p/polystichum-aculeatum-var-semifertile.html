                    <h1>Polystichum aculeatum var. semifertile</h1>
<p>Polystichum aculeatum var. semifertile, commonly known as the semi-fertile shield fern, is a variant of the common holly fern.</p>
<p>It is a perennial evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant features dark green, leathery, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive holly-like appearance. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with closely spaced, toothed pinnae.</p>
<p>While it can produce sporangia, the variant is named "semifertile" due to its reduced sporulation compared to the typical variety.</p>
