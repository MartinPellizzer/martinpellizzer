<p>Potentilla × subargentea, commonly known as silver potentilla, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in early summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
