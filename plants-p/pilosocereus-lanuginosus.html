                    <h1>Pilosocereus lanuginosus</h1>
<p>Pilosocereus lanuginosus, commonly known as the woolly night bloomer, is a cacti species native to the deserts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant typically grows as a solitary stem with a spherical or columnar shape, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. It produces large, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens.</p>
