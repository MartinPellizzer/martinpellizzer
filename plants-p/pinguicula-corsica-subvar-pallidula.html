                    <h1>Pinguicula corsica subvar. pallidula</h1>
<p>Pinguicula corsica subvar. pallidula, commonly known as the Corsican butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor habitats such as bogs and rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, arranged in a single stem, and bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>The subvariety pallidula is distinguished by its pale green leaves and reduced floral structures compared to the typical form.</p>
