                    <h1>Pachidendron</h1>
<p>Pachidendron, commonly known as the "bottle tree," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant is native to Australia and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Pachidendron species typically have narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produce small, showy flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and ornamental gardening.</p>
