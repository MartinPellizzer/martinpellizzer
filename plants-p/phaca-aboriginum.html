                    <h1>Phaca aboriginum</h1>
<p>Phaca aboriginum, commonly known as the Aboriginal fig, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for native animals. Phaca aboriginum is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its ecological significance is further highlighted by its role in traditional Aboriginal cultural practices.</p>
