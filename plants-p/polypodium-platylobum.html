<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial or epiphytic species, often found on rocks or tree trunks in shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
