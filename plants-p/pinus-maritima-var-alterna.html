                    <h1>Pinus maritima var. alterna</h1>
<p>Pinus maritima var. alterna, commonly known as the coastal pine, is a variant of the maritime pine native to the coastal regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>This evergreen conifer is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of the standard species. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the coastline, where it is adapted to salty sea air and strong coastal winds. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation along the shore.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various coastal wildlife and stabilizing dunes against erosion.</p>
