<p>Patagonium obscurum var. graveolens, commonly known as the Patagonian bittercress, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves and stems are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>The plant is noted for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is characteristic of the Brassicaceae family.</p>
