                    <h1>Pelazoneuron depilatum</h1>
<p>Pelazoneuron depilatum, commonly known as the naked leaf fern, is a unique plant characterized by its distinctive botanical features.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. The plant is notable for its reduced foliage, with leaves that are often sparse and lacking in the typical frond structure seen in many ferns. Its reproductive structures are well-developed, featuring sporangia that produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized morphology, Pelazoneuron depilatum is of interest to botanists studying evolutionary adaptations in ferns.</p>
