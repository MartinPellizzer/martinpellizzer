                    <h1>Pitcairnia mituensis</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia mituensis, commonly known as the Crimson Pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Amazon rainforest of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround its inflorescence, which can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, a common adaptation in its humid, tropical habitat. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on trees or rocky surfaces.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
