                    <h1>Pteris dichotoma var. elongata</h1>
<p>Pteris dichotoma var. elongata, commonly known as the long-leaf water fern, is a variant of the common water fern.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its elongated, narrow fronds that often grow in a rosette pattern. The fronds are typically divided into pinnae, which are further subdivided into smaller pinnules. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
