                    <h1>Pinus contorta</h1>
<p>Pinus contorta, commonly known as lodgepole pine, is a coniferous tree native to the western regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that grow in clusters of five. The tree produces cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across mountainous and boreal habitats. Its wood is strong and durable, historically used by Indigenous peoples and early settlers for construction and fuel.</p>
<p>Pinus contorta is also notable for its ability to regenerate after wildfires, making it a resilient species in fire-prone ecosystems.</p>
