                    <h1>Paspalum depressum</h1>
<p>Paspalum depressum, commonly known as flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of wetland vegetation.</p>
<p>Paspalum depressum is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils and is often found in regions with high humidity and rainfall.</p>
