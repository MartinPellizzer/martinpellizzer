<p>Phrygilanthus tumbecensis, commonly known as the Tumbecan sandveld star, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has adapted to its harsh environment with deep roots and waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
