<p>Potentilla bifurca subsp.</p>
<p>moorcroftii, commonly known as the Moorcroft's cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically features slender, branched stems covered in small, yellowish-green leaves that are alternate and oval in shape.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically five-petaled and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
