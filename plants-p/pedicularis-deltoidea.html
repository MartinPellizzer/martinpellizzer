                    <h1>Pedicularis deltoidea</h1>
<p>Pedicularis deltoidea, commonly known as the delta monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in alpine environments, often growing at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
