<p>Poa annua var. stricta, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, dark green leaves that are often rolled at the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, golf courses, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is both a desirable turfgrass and a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
