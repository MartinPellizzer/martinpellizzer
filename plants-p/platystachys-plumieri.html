<p>Platystachys plumieri, commonly known as the Chinese cliffbrake, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are clustered at the base of the fronds.</p>
<p>Platystachys plumieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage.</p>
