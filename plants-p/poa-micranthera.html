                    <h1>Poa micranthera</h1>
<p>Poa micranthera, commonly known as the dwarf mountain grass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many grass species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, Poa micranthera is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
