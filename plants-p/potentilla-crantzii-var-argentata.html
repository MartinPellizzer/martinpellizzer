                    <h1>Potentilla crantzii var. argentata</h1>
<p>Potentilla crantzii var. argentata, commonly known as silver potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and drought tolerance.</p>
