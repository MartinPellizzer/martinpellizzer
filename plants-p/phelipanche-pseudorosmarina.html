                    <h1>Phelipanche pseudorosmarina</h1>
<p>Phelipanche pseudorosmarina, commonly known as the false rosemary dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and thread-like stems. This species typically attaches itself to the roots of other plants, such as those in the Brassicaceae family. It is native to regions of southern Europe and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
