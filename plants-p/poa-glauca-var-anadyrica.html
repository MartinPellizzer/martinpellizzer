                    <h1>Poa glauca var. anadyrica</h1>
<p>Poa glauca var. anadyrica, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a variant of the bluegrass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it thrive in cold, harsh environments. The plant typically forms dense mats or cushions, which provide insulation and aid in moisture retention. It prefers well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
