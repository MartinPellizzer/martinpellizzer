                    <h1>Panoxis cataractae</h1>
<p>Panoxis cataractae, commonly known as the waterfall plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty regions of mountainous areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found near waterfalls or along stream banks. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, emitting a subtle fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
