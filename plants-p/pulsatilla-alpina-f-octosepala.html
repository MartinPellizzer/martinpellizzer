                    <h1>Pulsatilla alpina f. octosepala</h1>
<p>Pulsatilla alpina f. octosepala, commonly known as the alpine pasqueflower, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers with eight sepals, a distinctive feature of this particular form. Native to alpine regions of Europe, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. The plant produces a single, erect stem bearing a cluster of flowers, which bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
