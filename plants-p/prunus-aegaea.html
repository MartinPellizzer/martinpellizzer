                    <h1>Prunus aegaea</h1>
<p>Prunus aegaea, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and southwestern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, grey-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible drupes that are typically red or purple in color. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is resistant to decay and used in traditional craftsmanship.</p>
<p>Prunus aegaea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
