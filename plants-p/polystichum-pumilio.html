                    <h1>Polystichum pumilio</h1>
<p>Polystichum pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf fern or the alpine button fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and its ability to thrive in cool, moist environments. The fronds are typically short and curled, with a dark green coloration that becomes more pronounced in maturity. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in rocky or shaded habitats, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of alpine ecosystems.</p>
