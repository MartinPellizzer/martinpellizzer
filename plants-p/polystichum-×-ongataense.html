                    <h1>Polystichum × ongataense</h1>
<p>Polystichum × ongataense, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Polystichum setiferum and Polystichum acutiusculum.</p>
<p>It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its dense, upright fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing fiddleheads in early spring, which unfurl into mature fronds throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its lush foliage and ability to form compact, tidy clumps.</p>
