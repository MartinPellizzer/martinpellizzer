<p>Persica vulgaris var. autumnalis, commonly known as the autumn peach.</p>
<p>This variety is a cultivar of the peach tree that exhibits unique characteristics in its flowering and fruiting patterns. It typically blooms later in the growing season, often in late summer or early autumn, which is why it is named for its timing. The fruit is generally smaller than typical peaches and has a more intense flavor.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, as well as its distinctive fruit coloration.</p>
