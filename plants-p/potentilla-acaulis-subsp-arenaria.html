<p>Potentilla acaulis subsp.</p>
<p>arenaria, commonly known as sand potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
