                    <h1>Psidium harrisianum</h1>
<p>Psidium harrisianum, commonly known as the Harris's guava, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its fruit, although similar in appearance to the common guava, is less commonly consumed due to its smaller size and more acidic taste.</p>
<p>The plant is often grown for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and floral display.</p>
