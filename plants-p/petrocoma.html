                    <h1>Petrocoma</h1>
<p>Petrocoma, commonly known as the rockrose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Capparaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their woody stems and often spiny leaves. They are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Petrocoma species produce small, yellow or white flowers that are often clustered in racemes.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
