<p>Ptilotus yapukaratja, commonly known as the Yapa Karatja or the "flower of the desert," is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Goodeniaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, yellow or orange flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can endure extreme temperatures and drought conditions.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing nectar for native pollinators.</p>
