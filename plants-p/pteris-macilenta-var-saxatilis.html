                    <h1>Pteris macilenta var. saxatilis</h1>
<p>Pteris macilenta var. saxatilis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a compact, evergreen fern that thrives in rocky or shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a pale green coloration and a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, typical of fern reproductive systems. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland displays.</p>
