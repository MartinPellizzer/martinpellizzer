<p>Primula intricata subsp.</p>
<p>impigrorum, commonly known as the slow-growing primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, woolly foliage that is often covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated by gardeners interested in rare and hardy plants.</p>
