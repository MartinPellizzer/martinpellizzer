                    <h1>Pimpinella stewartii</h1>
<p>Pimpinella stewartii, commonly known as Stewart's cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It is native to western North America, particularly found in California and Oregon, where it thrives in dry, open habitats. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with slender, branching stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its small white or pale yellow flowers appear in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a small, hairy fruit called a schizocarp, which splits into two one-seeded parts when mature.</p>
