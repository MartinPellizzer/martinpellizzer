                    <h1>Pelatantheria rivesii</h1>
<p>Pelatantheria rivesii, commonly known as the Rives' ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white to pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pelatantheria rivesii is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of conservation interest.</p>
