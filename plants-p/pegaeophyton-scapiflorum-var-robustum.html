<p>Pegaeophyton scapiflorum var. robustum, commonly known as the robust pegaeophyton, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the early spring. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in temperate forests or on rocky outcrops. Its leaves are usually thin and translucent, adapted to low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
