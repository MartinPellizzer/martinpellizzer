                    <h1>Phaeocephalum knieskernii</h1>
<p>Phaeocephalum knieskernii, commonly known as the silverleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive silvery-gray to pale greenish appearance due to its dense covering of minute, white to pale yellowish vegetative layers.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on bark, stone, or soil in temperate regions. The thallus is typically leathery and flat, with a complex structure that includes a medulla, cortex, and algal layers. This lichen is known for its slow growth and is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and its contribution to the study of lichen symbiosis.</p>
