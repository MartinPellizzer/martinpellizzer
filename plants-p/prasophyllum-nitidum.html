                    <h1>Prasophyllum nitidum</h1>
<p>Prasophyllum nitidum, commonly known as the glossy leek orchid, is an Australian native orchid species characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, grass-like foliage.</p>
<p>It produces striking, upright spikes of pale green to yellowish flowers, which are often adorned with a reddish or purple tint. The plant is adapted to grow in sandy or loamy soils in open habitats, such as heathlands and woodlands. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, typical of many orchid species.</p>
<p>Prasophyllum nitidum is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and land clearing, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
