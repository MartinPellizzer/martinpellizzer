                    <h1>Phalaris aquatica var. minor</h1>
<p>Phalaris aquatica var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are generally narrower than those of the typical *Phalaris aquatica*. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in spikes during the summer months.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
