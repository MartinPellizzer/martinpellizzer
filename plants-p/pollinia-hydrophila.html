                    <h1>Pollinia hydrophila</h1>
<p>Pollinia hydrophila, commonly known as the water pollinia, is a rare aquatic plant native to certain freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique structure, featuring dense, sticky pollinia that adhere to the bodies of pollinators. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters, where it forms dense underwater mats. Its reproductive strategy relies heavily on waterborne pollination, making it highly adapted to its wetland environment.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
