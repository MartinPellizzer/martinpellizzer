                    <h1>Pitcairnia peruana</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia peruana, commonly known as the Peruvian air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water absorption. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts.</p>
