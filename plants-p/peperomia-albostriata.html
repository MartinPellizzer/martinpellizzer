                    <h1>Peperomia albostriata</h1>
<p>Peperomia albostriata, commonly known as the white-striped peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It features glossy, ovate leaves with striking white veins that contrast beautifully against its deep green foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of pink or red, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Peperomia albostriata is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
