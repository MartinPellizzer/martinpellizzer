<p>Polygala extraaxillaris f. humilis, commonly known as the low-growing polygala, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Polygalaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically display a range of colors, from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in specific, often nutrient-poor, sandy or rocky soils and is found in particular regions of South Africa. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically unique species.</p>
