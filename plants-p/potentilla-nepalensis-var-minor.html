                    <h1>Potentilla nepalensis var. minor</h1>
<p>Potentilla nepalensis var. minor, commonly known as the Himalayan cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Nepal and northern India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has finely divided, serrated leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
