                    <h1>Paspalum acutissimum</h1>
<p>Paspalum acutissimum, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, erect stems that often grow in dense mats. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Paspalum acutissimum is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
