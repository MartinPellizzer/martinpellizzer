<p>Peranema aspidioides, commonly known as the broad-leafed liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thallus that is often divided into leaf-like structures, which are arranged in a rosette pattern. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead relies on its thallus for absorption and photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Peranema aspidioides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates.</p>
