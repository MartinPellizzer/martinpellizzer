                    <h1>Postia lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Postia lanuginosa, commonly known as the silky polypore, is a species of fungus that belongs to the family Polyporaceae.</p>
<p>It is a wood-decaying basidiomycete that typically grows on dead or decaying hardwoods, especially in temperate forests. The fruiting bodies of Postia lanuginosa are small, sponge-like, and often have a velvety or fuzzy surface, which gives the species its common name. It is characterized by its white to pale yellow pores and a generally soft, spongy texture.</p>
<p>This fungus plays an important ecological role in breaking down dead wood and recycling nutrients in forest ecosystems.</p>
