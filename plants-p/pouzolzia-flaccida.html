                    <h1>Pouzolzia flaccida</h1>
<p>Pouzolzia flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid pouzolzia, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes.</p>
