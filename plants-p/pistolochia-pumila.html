                    <h1>Pistolochia pumila</h1>
<p>Pistolochia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf pistol plant, is a small, herbaceous shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry environment. Its roots are shallow but extensive, allowing it to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil.</p>
<p>Pistolochia pumila is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in harsh desert conditions.</p>
