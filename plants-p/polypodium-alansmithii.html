                    <h1>Polypodium alansmithii</h1>
<p>Polypodium alansmithii, commonly known as the Alansmith's holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 10 inches in length. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry roots that help anchor it to rocky or shaded habitats. Its spore-bearing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species.</p>
