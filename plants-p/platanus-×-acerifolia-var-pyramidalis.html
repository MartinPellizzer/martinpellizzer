                    <h1>Platanus × acerifolia var. pyramidalis</h1>
<p>Platanus × acerifolia var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the London plane tree, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the American sycamore and the Oriental plane.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive mottled bark that peels in a papery texture, revealing a lighter inner layer. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, spherical fruits that split open to release tufted seeds.</p>
<p>This tree is highly adaptable, thriving in urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compacted soils.</p>
