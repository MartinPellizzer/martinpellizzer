<p>Panicum lutzii, commonly known as Lutz's panicgrass, is a species of grass native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland and marshy habitats, often found in areas with high humidity and poor soil drainage.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range.</p>
