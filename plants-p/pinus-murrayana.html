                    <h1>Pinus murrayana</h1>
<p>Pinus murrayana, commonly known as Murray's pine, is a species of conifer native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect trunk and dense, needle-like foliage that forms a conical shape. The plant produces both male and female cones, with the female cones developing into woody seed cones that release seeds in the autumn. Its needles are typically dark green and retain their color year-round, contributing to its evergreen nature.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to cold, mountainous climates and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>
