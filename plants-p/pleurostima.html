                    <h1>Pleurostima</h1>
<p>Pleurostima, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its unique, often ephemeral blooms that appear after rainfall. The plant typically has hairy, succulent leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, purple, or red. Pleurostima species are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in their thick stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, they are often considered endangered or threatened in many areas.</p>
