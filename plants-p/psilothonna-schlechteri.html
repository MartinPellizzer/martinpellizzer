                    <h1>Psilothonna schlechteri</h1>
<p>Psilothonna schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence and striking, pale blue or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, growing on tree branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it requires a humid, shaded environment to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Psilothonna schlechteri is considered critically endangered.</p>
