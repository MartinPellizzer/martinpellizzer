                    <h1>Pellaea hirsuta</h1>
<p>Pellaea hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pellaeaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and hairy, leathery fronds that give it its common name. Native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found on cliffs or in dry, sunny habitats. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptation to arid environments make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
