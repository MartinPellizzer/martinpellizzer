<p>[WRONG START] Pleurotholis autraniana, commonly known as the Autran's orchid, is a species native to the rainforests of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often clustered in racemose inflorescences. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-shaped, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and less commonly cultivated orchid.</p>
