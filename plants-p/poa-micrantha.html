<p>Poa micrantha, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and has slender, wiry stems with small, narrow leaves. The plant produces compact spikelets that contain tiny, spike-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping and as a ground cover.</p>
