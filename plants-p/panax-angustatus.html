                    <h1>Panax angustatus</h1>
<p>Panax angustatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries, which contain the seeds. Its roots, which are the primary part used in traditional medicine, are valued for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Panax angustatus is now considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
