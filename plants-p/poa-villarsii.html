<p>Poa villarsii, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a species of grass native to the high altitudes of the Alps and other mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, perennial grass with fine, wiry leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, Poa villarsii is an important component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
