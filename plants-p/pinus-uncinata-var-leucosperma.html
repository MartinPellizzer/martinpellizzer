<p>Pinus uncinata var. leucosperma, commonly known as the whitecone pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive white to pale yellow cones, which contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Its needle-like leaves are short and twisted, and it produces both male and female cones on the same tree.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its unique coloration and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
