                    <h1>Panicum repens var. arenarium</h1>
<p>Panicum repens var. arenarium, commonly known as sand panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and fine, thread-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, facilitating its spread across sandy or disturbed soils. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes, grasslands, and sandy wastelands.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
