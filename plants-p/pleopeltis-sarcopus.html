<p>Pleopeltis sarcopus, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocky surfaces or tree trunks in humid, tropical environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with closely spaced, lance-shaped leaves. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves.</p>
