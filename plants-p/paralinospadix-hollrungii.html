The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on the forest floor or in rocky crevices. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, highlighting its ecological niche within the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it faces significant conservation challenges.</p>
