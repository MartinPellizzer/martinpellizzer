<p>Ptilagrostis semenowii, commonly known as the Semenow's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that are typically pale green to golden in color. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppe and rocky areas, where it forms low, spreading mats. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native ecosystem.</p>
