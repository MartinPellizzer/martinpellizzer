                    <h1>Pteroceras minutiflorum</h1>
<p>Pteroceras minutiflorum, commonly known as the dwarf coralroot, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph that relies on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are clustered in a raceme, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth requirements, it is considered a rare and elusive species in its native range.</p>
