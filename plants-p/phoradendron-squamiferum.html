                    <h1>Phoradendron squamiferum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron squamiferum, commonly known as the velvetleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's tissue. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature and unique growth form make it an interesting subject in ecological studies.</p>
