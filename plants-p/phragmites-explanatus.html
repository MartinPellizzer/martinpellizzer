<p>It has long, flat, blade-like leaves that are often broader than those of other reed species. The plant produces dense clusters of small, fluffy flowers that are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes spread aggressively, forming large colonies that can dominate wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Phragmites explanatus plays a significant role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
