                    <h1>Pitcairnia minicorallina</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia minicorallina, commonly known as the miniature coral pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces striking, orchid-like flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
