                    <h1>Poa scabrella</h1>
<p>Poa scabrella, commonly known as the scaly bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, scaly texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization and ecological diversity.</p>
