                    <h1>Poa alpina var. djurdjurae</h1>
<p>Poa alpina var. djurdjurae, commonly known as the Djurdjura alpine grass, is a variant of the alpine bentgrass native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in mountainous areas, meadows, and tundra environments. Its flowering stems produce small, spikelet-like inflorescences, and it blooms during the short growing season of its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
