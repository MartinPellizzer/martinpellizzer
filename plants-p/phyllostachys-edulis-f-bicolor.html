<p>Phyllostachys edulis f. bicolor, commonly known as the variegated bamboo, is a unique variant of the common bamboo species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking bicolor leaves, which display a mix of green and white or yellow patterns. This plant is a clumping bamboo, forming dense stands rather than spreading aggressively. The variegation is due to genetic mutations that affect chlorophyll distribution.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and landscapes.</p>
