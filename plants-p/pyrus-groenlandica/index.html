                            <h1>Pyrus Groenlandica</h1>
<p>Pyrus groenlandica, also known as the Greenland whitebeam, is a rare and hardy species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. This small tree or shrub thrives in harsh environments where few plants can survive. It is characterized by its dense, white-woolly leaves and small, edible berries. The plant plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing food for wildlife and stabilizing fragile soils. Due to its limited range and vulnerability to climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
