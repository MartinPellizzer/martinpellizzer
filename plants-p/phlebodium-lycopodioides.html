                    <h1>Phlebodium lycopodioides</h1>
<p>Phlebodium lycopodioides, commonly known as the common staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, rounded clusters on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
