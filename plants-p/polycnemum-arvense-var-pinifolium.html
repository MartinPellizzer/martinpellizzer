                    <h1>Polycnemum arvense var. pinifolium</h1>
<p>Polycnemum arvense var. pinifolium, commonly known as the pineleaf field sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common weed in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>The variety pinifolium is distinguished by its needle-like leaves, resembling those of conifers, which give it its common name.</p>
