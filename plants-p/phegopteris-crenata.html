                    <h1>Phegopteris crenata</h1>
<p>Phegopteris crenata, commonly known as the serrated water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has a delicate, feathery appearance with fronds that are divided into small, serrated segments. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant in the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>The serrated water fern plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
