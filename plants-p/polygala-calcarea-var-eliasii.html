<p>Polygala calcarea var. eliasii, commonly known as Elias's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to low moisture conditions. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in open plains, disturbed sites, and along roadsides.</p>
