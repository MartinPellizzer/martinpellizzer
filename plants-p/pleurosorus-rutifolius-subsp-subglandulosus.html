<p>Pleurosorus rutifolius subsp.</p>
<p>subglandulosus, commonly known as the glandular shield fern, is a member of the Pteridaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered with small, glandular dots.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds, which are divided into segments called pinnae.</p>
<p>This subspecies is distinguished by its unique glandular structures, which contribute to its ecological interactions and survival in its habitat.</p>
