<p>Ponthieva paranaensis, commonly known as the Parana river fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as rivers and lakes, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
