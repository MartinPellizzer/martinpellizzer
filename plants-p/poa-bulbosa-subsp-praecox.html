<p>Poa bulbosa subsp.</p>
<p>praecox, commonly known as early bulbous bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and tufted clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. Its rhizomes and bulbous stems allow it to survive harsh conditions and regenerate quickly after disturbances.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine and rocky habitats.</p>
