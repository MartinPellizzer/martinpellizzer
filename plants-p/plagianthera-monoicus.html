<p>Plagianthera monoicus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a small flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland desert environments. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Plagianthera monoicus is known for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
