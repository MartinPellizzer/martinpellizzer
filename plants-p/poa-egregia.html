                    <h1>Poa egregia</h1>
<p>Poa egregia, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, dark green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are typically blue-green in color, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Poa egregia is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy choice for alpine gardens.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna.</p>
