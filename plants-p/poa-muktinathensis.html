                    <h1>Poa muktinathensis</h1>
<p>Poa muktinathensis, commonly known as the Muktinath grass, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of Nepal.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its slender, grass-like structure and tufted growth habit. This plant thrives in cold, alpine environments, typically at elevations above 4,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps protect it from harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Poa muktinathensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
