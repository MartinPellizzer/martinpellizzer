                    <h1>Polystichum lentum var. bifurcatum</h1>
<p>Polystichum lentum var. bifurcatum, commonly known as the forked wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds that often split into two distinct branches, giving it the "bifurcatum" designation. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clusters.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
