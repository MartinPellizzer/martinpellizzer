                    <h1>Paspalum devincenzii</h1>
<p>Paspalum devincenzii, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. This plant is highly adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common species in coastal dunes and beach environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ability to stabilize coastal soils, it plays an important ecological role in preventing erosion along shorelines.</p>
