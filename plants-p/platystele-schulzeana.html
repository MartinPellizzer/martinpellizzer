                    <h1>Platystele schulzeana</h1>
<p>Platystele schulzeana, commonly known as the Schultze's ghost plant, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central water-holding cup. Native to the cloud forests of Central America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale pink, emerge from the leaf axils and are adapted for pollination by small insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Platystele schulzeana is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
