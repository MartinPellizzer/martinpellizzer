                    <h1>Placus subcapitatus</h1>
<p>Placus subcapitatus, commonly known as the narrow-headed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, inflated bladders that trap aquatic invertebrates, which it then digests for nutrients. This species typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, where it plays a role in controlling microfauna populations. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to temperate climates and is often found in ponds and wetlands across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
