                    <h1>Polypodium subevenosum</h1>
<p>Polypodium subevenosum, commonly known as the narrow-veined water fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds with closely spaced, narrow veins. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
