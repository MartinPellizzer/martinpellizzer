                    <h1>Pachygenium orobanchoides</h1>
<p>Pachygenium orobanchoides, commonly known as the giant broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the Mediterranean region. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to its lack of leaves and stems. It is known for its ability to parasitize a variety of host plants, including grasses and legumes.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in certain ecosystems by influencing host plant populations.</p>
