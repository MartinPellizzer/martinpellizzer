<p>Phymatosorus cuspidatus subsp.</p>
<p>cuspidatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and leathery in texture.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually unifacial, meaning they have a single surface with spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>The plant's reproductive structures are clustered along the margins of the fronds, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
