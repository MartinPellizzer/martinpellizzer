<p>Phelypaea lusitanica, commonly known as the Iberian water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its roots are adapted for anchoring in soft substrates, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged.</p>
<p>Phelypaea lusitanica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
