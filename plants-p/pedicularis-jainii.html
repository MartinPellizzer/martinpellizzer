                <h1>Pedicularis jainii</h1>
<p>Pedicularis jainii, commonly known as the Jain's lousewort, is a flowering plant belonging to the genus Pedicularis in the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. Native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas, it thrives in cool, moist environments at high elevations. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
