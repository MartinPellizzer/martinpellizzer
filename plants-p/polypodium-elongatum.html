<p>Polypodium elongatum, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, creeping rhizomes that allow it to climb and spread across various surfaces. The plant produces fertile fronds with spore-producing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in a single row along the underside of the leaves. Its leaves are usually bipinnately compound, with a distinct, elongated shape.</p>
<p>Polypodium elongatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
