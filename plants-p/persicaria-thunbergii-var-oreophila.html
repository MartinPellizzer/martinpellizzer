<p>Persicaria thunbergii var. oreophila, commonly known as the alpine knotweed, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright stems that are often hairy, with lance-shaped leaves that are serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cooler, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates.</p>
