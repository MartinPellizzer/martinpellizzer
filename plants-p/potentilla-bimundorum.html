<p>Potentilla bimundorum, commonly known as the two-world potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It is adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Potentilla genus.</p>
