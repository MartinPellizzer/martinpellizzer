                    <h1>Pronephrium clemensiae</h1>
<p>Pronephrium clemensiae, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are slender and often root in the substrate, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually submerged, with only the tips occasionally emerging above the water surface.</p>
