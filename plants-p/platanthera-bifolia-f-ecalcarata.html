                    <h1>Platanthera bifolia f. ecalcarata</h1>
<p>Platanthera bifolia f. ecalcarata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires specific conditions to thrive. It is often found in bogs, fens, and other moist environments across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered threatened in many regions.</p>
