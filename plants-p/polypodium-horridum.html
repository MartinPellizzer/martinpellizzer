<p>Polypodium horridum, commonly known as the humped fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, hump-backed fronds that are typically dark green and covered with small, backward-pointing teeth. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Polypodium horridum reproduces via spores, which are released from the sorus located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
