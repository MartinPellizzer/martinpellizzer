<p>Pogonotium, commonly known as the beard grass, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive tufts of stiff, bristle-like hairs at the base of the inflorescence, which give it its common name. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Pogonotium species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
