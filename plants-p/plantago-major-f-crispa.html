                    <h1>Plantago major f. crispa</h1>
<p>Plantago major f. crispa, commonly known as the curled plantain, is a variant of the common plantain characterized by its distinctive curled leaves.</p>
<p>This perennial herb belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The leaves are typically shorter and more compact compared to the standard Plantago major, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, roadsides, and other urban environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
