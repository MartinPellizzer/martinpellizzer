                    <h1>Pityrogramma williamsii</h1>
<p>Pityrogramma williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
