<p>Protea montana, commonly known as the mountain protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that resemble a cluster of flowers, though they are actually a single complex flower structure. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, often found in mountainous regions. Its flowers come in shades of white, pink, and red, and it blooms during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>Protea montana is also valued for its ornamental use in horticulture and is a symbol of the biodiversity of South Africa's fynbos vegetation.</p>
