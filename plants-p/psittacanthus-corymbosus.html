                    <h1>Psittacanthus corymbosus</h1>
<p>Psittacanthus corymbosus, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, scale-like leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides nectar to attract pollinators such as insects and birds.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries, making it an important component of forest ecosystems.</p>
