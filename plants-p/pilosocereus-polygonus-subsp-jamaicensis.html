<p>Pilosocereus polygonus subsp.</p>
<p>jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica. It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible fruits resembling small, green figs. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local cultures.</p>
