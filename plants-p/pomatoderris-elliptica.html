                    <h1>Pomatoderris elliptica</h1>
<p>Pomatoderris elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leafed acacia, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in pairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are borne in the axils of the leaves. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Pomatoderris elliptica is often used in rehabilitation projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>
