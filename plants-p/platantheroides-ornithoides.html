                    <h1>Platantheroides ornithoides</h1>
<p>Platantheroides ornithoides, commonly known as the bird's nest orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique inflorescence that resembles a bird's nest, with pale green to yellowish flowers clustered together. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and damp meadows. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
