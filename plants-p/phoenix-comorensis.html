                    <h1>Phoenix comorensis</h1>
<p>Phoenix comorensis, commonly known as the Comorian date palm, is a species native to the Comoros archipelago in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is a tall, slender palm with a single trunk and gracefully arching fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible dates, although its fruit is not as widely cultivated as other date palms. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires ample sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
