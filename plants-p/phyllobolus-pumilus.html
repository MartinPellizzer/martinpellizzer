                    <h1>Phyllobolus pumilus</h1>
<p>Phyllobolus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf leaf beetle, is a small, herbivorous insect belonging to the family Chrysomelidae.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it feeds on various species of plants, particularly those in the families Fabaceae and Myrtaceae. The beetle's life cycle involves laying eggs on the undersides of leaves, which hatch into larvae that continue to feed on plant tissues. Its presence can sometimes lead to defoliation in affected plants, making it a potential agricultural pest.</p>
<p>Despite its small size, Phyllobolus pumilus plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by contributing to nutrient cycling through its feeding activities.</p>
