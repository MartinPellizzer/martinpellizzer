<p>Phaulanthus nervosus, commonly known as the slender leaf phaulanthus, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Phaulanthus nervosus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
