<p>Pellaea breweri, commonly known as the Brewer's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green with a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Pellaea breweri produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
