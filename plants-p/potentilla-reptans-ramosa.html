                    <h1>Potentilla reptans ramosa</h1>
<p>Potentilla reptans ramosa, commonly known as creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sprawling habit, with multiple branches arising from the base, and small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on short pedicels. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread easily, forming dense mats that can colonize rocky or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is often used in landscaping for erosion control due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
