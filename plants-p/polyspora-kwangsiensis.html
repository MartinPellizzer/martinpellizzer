                    <h1>Polyspora kwangsiensis</h1>
<p>Polyspora kwangsiensis, commonly known as the Guangxi polyspora, is a rare fern native to southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polysporaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that emerge from a central rhizome. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
