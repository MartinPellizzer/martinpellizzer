                    <h1>Pinus sylvestris var. sphagnicola</h1>
<p>Pinus sylvestris var. sphagnicola, commonly known as the Sphagnum pine, is a variant of the Scots pine that thrives in peatland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its adaptation to acidic, waterlogged soils, which are typical of bogs and wet heaths. The plant exhibits a slower growth rate compared to other pine species due to the challenging conditions of its habitat. Its needles are typically shorter and more densely packed, providing better insulation against the cold and moisture.</p>
<p>This variety plays a significant role in the ecological stability of peatland ecosystems.</p>
