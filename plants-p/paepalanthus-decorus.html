                    <h1>Paepalanthus decorus</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus decorus, commonly known as the golden cup-moss, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial bromeliad that forms dense, cushion-like rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, yellow-orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding visual interest to its appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
