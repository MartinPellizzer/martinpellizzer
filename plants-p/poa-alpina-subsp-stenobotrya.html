<p>Poa alpina subsp.</p>
<p>stenobotrya, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
