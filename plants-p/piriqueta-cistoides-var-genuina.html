                    <h1>Piriqueta cistoides var. genuina</h1>
<p>Piriqueta cistoides var. genuina, commonly known as the Mexican rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a delicate touch to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil.</p>
