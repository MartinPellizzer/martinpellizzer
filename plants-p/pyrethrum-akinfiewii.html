<p>Pyrethrum akinfiewii, commonly known as the African pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white to pale pink petals. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across arid and semi-arid regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Pyrethrum akinfiewii is also valued for its potential use in natural pest control due to the presence of pyrethrins in its flower heads.</p>
