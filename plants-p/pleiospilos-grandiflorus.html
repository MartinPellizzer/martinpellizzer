<p>Pleiospilos grandiflorus, commonly known as the giant ice plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in summer. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Despite its hardy nature, it requires well-draining soil and minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
