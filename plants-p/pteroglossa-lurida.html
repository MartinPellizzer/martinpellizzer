                    <h1>Pteroglossa lurida</h1>
<p>Pteroglossa lurida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble a ghostly face, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Pteroglossa lurida is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation efforts.</p>
