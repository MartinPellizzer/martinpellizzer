<p>Pteris lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and finely divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Pteris lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
