                    <h1>Physalis pringlei var. curtiloba</h1>
<p>Physalis pringlei var. curtiloba, commonly known as the Mexican groundcherry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, round fruits that are encased in a papery calyx, turning orange-red when mature. These fruits are edible and often used in culinary applications, though they are not as widely cultivated as other Physalis species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies.</p>
