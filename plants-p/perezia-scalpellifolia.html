                    <h1>Perezia scalpellifolia</h1>
<p>Perezia scalpellifolia, commonly known as the scalpel-leaved perezia, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, blade-like leaves that give it its common name, which resemble a scalpel in shape. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Perezia scalpellifolia is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
