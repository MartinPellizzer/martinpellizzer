                    <h1>Paspalum taphrophyllum</h1>
<p>Paspalum taphrophyllum, commonly known as the dwarf paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in restoration projects for stabilizing soil in wetland areas.</p>
