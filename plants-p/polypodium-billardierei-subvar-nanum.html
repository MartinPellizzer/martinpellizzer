<p>Polypodium billardierei subvar. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf wall fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and shaded forest floors. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with narrow, strap-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>This subvariety is distinguished by its smaller size and more delicate fronds compared to the main species.</p>
