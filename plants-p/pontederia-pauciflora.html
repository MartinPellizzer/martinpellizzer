<p>Pontederia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered water hyacinth, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. The plant features floating leaves that are oval to lance-shaped with a waxy surface, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of blue or purple. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, which can impact water flow and aquatic life.</p>
<p>It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
