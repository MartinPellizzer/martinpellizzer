The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that emit a subtle fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
