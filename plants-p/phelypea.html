<p>Phelypea, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, fern-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. Phelypea species are typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and stream banks. They have a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing them to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
