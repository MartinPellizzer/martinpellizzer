<p>Phacelia minutissima, commonly known as the dwarf phacelia, is a small annual flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, delicate blue to purple flowers and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its size and appearance, it is often mistaken for a weed but is valued for its role in supporting pollinators and soil stability.</p>
