                    <h1>Pinus mugo var. compacta</h1>
<p>Pinus mugo var. compacta, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with needle-like leaves that are short and dark green, often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature to a dark brown color, releasing seeds in the spring. Its unique growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and resilience in cold, high-altitude climates.</p>
