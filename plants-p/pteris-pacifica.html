<p>Pteris pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific water fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in wet environments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded areas and is often found in tidal zones or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across wetlands and marshes.</p>
<p>Pteris pacifica plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
