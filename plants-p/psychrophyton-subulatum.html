<p>Psychrophyton subulatum, commonly known as the snow feather plant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and tiny, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the short summer season. Psychrophyton subulatum thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its ability to survive in extreme conditions with minimal resources.</p>
