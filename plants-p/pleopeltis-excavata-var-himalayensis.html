<p>Pleopeltis excavata var. himalayensis, commonly known as the Himalayan rock fern, is a species native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocky substrates and in shaded, humid environments. The plant features a slender, creeping rhizome with lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense, hairy coating. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rocky gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
