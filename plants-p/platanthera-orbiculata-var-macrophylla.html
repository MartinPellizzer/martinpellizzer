                    <h1>Platanthera orbiculata var. macrophylla</h1>
<p>Platanthera orbiculata var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and moist meadows in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and tall, branching inflorescences that bear numerous showy, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and requires consistent moisture throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a species of concern in some regions.</p>
