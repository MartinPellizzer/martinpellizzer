                    <h1>Platanthera blephariglottis</h1>
<p>Platanthera blephariglottis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wet meadows and marshes in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tall, spike-like inflorescence bearing small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to moist, acidic soils and often thrives in areas with standing water. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts.</p>
