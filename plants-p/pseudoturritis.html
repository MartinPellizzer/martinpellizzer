                    <h1>Pseudoturritis</h1>
<p>Pseudoturritis, commonly known as the false turricula, is a genus of sea snails belonging to the family Turbinellidae.</p>
<p>These marine gastropod mollusks are characterized by their elongated, spiral shells that are often brightly colored and intricately patterned. They are typically found in tropical and subtropical waters, inhabiting coral reefs and rocky substrates. The shells of Pseudoturritis species are composed of calcium carbonate, with a nacreous inner layer that provides structural strength.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their role within marine ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and serving as indicators of habitat health.</p>
