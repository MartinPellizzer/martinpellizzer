                    <h1>Phlomis dentosa</h1>
<p>Phlomis dentosa, commonly known as the toothed flax or narrow-leaved flax, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and gray-green, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces tall spikes of pale blue to purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Phlomis dentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
