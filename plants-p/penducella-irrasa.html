                    <h1>Penducella irrasa</h1>
<p>Penducella irrasa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake, making it highly dependent on its environment. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Penducella irrasa is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation interest.</p>
