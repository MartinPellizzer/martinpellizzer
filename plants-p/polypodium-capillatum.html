                    <h1>Polypodium capillatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium capillatum, commonly known as the slender wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often grow in dense clusters on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form extensive colonies. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Polypodium capillatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions.</p>
