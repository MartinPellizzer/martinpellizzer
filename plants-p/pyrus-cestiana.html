                    <h1>Pyrus cestiana</h1>
<p>Pyrus cestiana, commonly known as the Cestian pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, round pomes that are typically small and sweet. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or as a ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within the genus Pyrus.</p>
