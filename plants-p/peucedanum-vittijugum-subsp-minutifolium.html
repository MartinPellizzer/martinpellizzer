<p>Peucedanum vittijugum subsp.</p>
<p>minutifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved cowparsley, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered umbels of white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Native to specific regions in Central Asia, this subspecies thrives in rocky or arid environments. Its slender, often hairy stems and aromatic foliage suggest potential medicinal properties, though its botanical study remains limited.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
