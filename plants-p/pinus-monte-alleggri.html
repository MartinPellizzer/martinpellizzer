                    <h1>Pinus monte-alleggri</h1>
<p>Pinus monte-alleggri, commonly known as the Monte Allegri pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy.</p>
<p>This coniferous tree is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. It produces cones that are woody and often remain attached to the branches for several years. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
