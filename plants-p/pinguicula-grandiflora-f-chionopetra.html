                    <h1>Pinguicula grandiflora f. chionopetra</h1>
<p>Pinguicula grandiflora f. chionopetra, commonly known as the snowy petal butterwort, is a rare and striking carnivorous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems topped with showy, white or pale pink flowers that resemble petals. Its leaves are glandular and secrete digestive enzymes to break down prey.</p>
<p>This frost-tolerant species thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
