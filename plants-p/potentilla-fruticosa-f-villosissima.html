                    <h1>Potentilla fruticosa f. villosissima</h1>
<p>Potentilla fruticosa f. villosissima, commonly known as the silky cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and hairy, silvery-gray foliage that helps insulate it against cold temperatures. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
