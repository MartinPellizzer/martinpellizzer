                    <h1>Polystichum munitum var. imbricans</h1>
<p>Polystichum munitum var. imbricans, commonly known as the western sword fern, is a variant of the evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green, sword-shaped fronds that are deeply divided and often have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The varietal name *imbricans* refers to the overlapping arrangement of its leaflets, which provides structural support and protection against moisture loss.</p>
