<p>Polystichum eriorachis, commonly known as the soft-hairy wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
