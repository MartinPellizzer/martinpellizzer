The plant exhibits a typical gymnosperm reproductive system, with seeds enclosed in woody cones. Its botanical features include a tall, straight trunk and a conical shape, typical of many pine species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for ecological and conservation studies.</p>
