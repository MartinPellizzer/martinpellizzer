                    <h1>Phellandrium aquaticum</h1>
<p>Phellandrium aquaticum, commonly known as the water bottle plant, is a unique aquatic species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in shallow, still water environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny white flowers that bloom in spring. It plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems by preventing soil erosion.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it is considered an important indicator species for the health of freshwater habitats.</p>
