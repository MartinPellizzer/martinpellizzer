                    <h1>Pyrrhocactus choapensis</h1>
<p>Pyrrhocactus choapensis, commonly known as the Choap√© cactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
