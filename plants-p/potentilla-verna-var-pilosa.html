<p>Potentilla verna var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name "pilosa," meaning "hairy" in Latin. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
