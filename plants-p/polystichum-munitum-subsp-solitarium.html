<p>Polystichum munitum subsp.</p>
<p>solitarium, commonly known as the Pacific silver fern, is a fern native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
