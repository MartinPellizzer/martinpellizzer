                    <h1>Pepinia punicea</h1>
<p>Pepinia punicea, commonly known as the red peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple hues, especially under bright light conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which bloom during the warmer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit makes it easy to propagate through division or stem cuttings.</p>
<p>Pepinia punicea is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance.</p>
