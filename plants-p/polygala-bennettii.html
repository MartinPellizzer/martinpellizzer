<p>Polygala bennettii, commonly known as Bennett's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to western Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Bennett's milkvetch is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
