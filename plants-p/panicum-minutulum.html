<p>Panicum minutulum, commonly known as little panicgrass, is a small, annual grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is often found in moist to mesic environments. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with small, spikelet-based inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and fine, hairy texture.</p>
