                    <h1>Pogonia ravenii</h1>
<p>Pogonia ravenii, commonly known as the black ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black petals and sepals, which give it its ominous appearance. The plant typically grows on the bark of trees in moist, shaded environments, forming a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered threatened and is protected in many regions.</p>
