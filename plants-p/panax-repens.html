                    <h1>Panax repens</h1>
<p>Panax repens, commonly known as wild ginseng, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, trifoliate leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds. Panax repens is valued for its medicinal properties, though it is less commonly used than its more famous relative, Panax quinquefolius.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions.</p>
