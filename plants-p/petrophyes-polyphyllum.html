                    <h1>Petrophyes polyphyllum</h1>
<p>Petrophyes polyphyllum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a unique plant species adapted to grow in rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, wiry fronds that form a compact rosette, allowing it to retain moisture in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Petrophyes polyphyllum is often found in limestone or sandstone areas, where it thrives in shallow soil pockets.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils makes it a resilient and specialized member of its ecosystem.</p>
