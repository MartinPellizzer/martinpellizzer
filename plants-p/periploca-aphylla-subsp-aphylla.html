<p>Periploca aphylla subsp.</p>
<p>aphylla, commonly known as the leafless periploca, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and the absence of true leaves, instead having small, scale-like structures.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
