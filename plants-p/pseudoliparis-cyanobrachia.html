                    <h1>Pseudoliparis cyanobrachia</h1>
<p>Pseudoliparis cyanobrachia, commonly known as the blue-branched sea snail, is a species of marine gastropod mollusk in the family Pseudoliparidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated body and a distinctive blue or cyan coloration on its branched gill structures. This species is typically found in deep-sea environments, often associated with hydrothermal vents or cold seeps where it feeds on microbial mats. Its anatomy includes a reduced shell and a well-developed mantle that covers its respiratory organs.</p>
<p>The plant-like appearance of its gill branches has led to its name, reflecting its unique adaptation to its extreme habitat.</p>
