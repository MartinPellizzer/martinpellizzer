                    <h1>Parathelypteris uraiensis var. tibetica</h1>
<p>Parathelypteris uraiensis var. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan shield fern, is a rare and lesser-known fern species native to the mountainous regions of Tibet.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds with a broad, leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories at high altitudes. Its reproductive structures, including sori and indusia, are well-developed and contribute to its unique botanical identity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
