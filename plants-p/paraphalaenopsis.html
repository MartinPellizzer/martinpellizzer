                    <h1>Paraphalaenopsis</h1>
<p>Paraphalaenopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Unlike many orchids, it does not require a symbiotic relationship with fungi for nutrient uptake, which makes it unique in the orchid family. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its delicate appearance and elusive nature have made it a subject of both botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
