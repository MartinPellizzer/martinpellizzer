<p>Paphiopedilum kolopakingii f. katherinae, commonly known as the Katherina's lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the Philippines.</p>

The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with a short, thick rhizome and dense, dark green foliage. It produces showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and susceptibility to habitat loss, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
