<p>Phegopteris excelsior, commonly known as the noble fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients effectively.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in humid conditions.</p>
