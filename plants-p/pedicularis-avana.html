                    <h1>Pedicularis avana</h1>
<p>Pedicularis avana, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on its host for nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. The plant features a slender, erect stem with whorled leaves and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
