<p>Pentaschistis tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted leaf fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, curling fronds that give it a distinctive, almost spiral appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor itself to rocks or tree trunks, contributing to its epiphytic nature.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
