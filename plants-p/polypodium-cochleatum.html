                    <h1>Polypodium cochleatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium cochleatum, commonly known as the earney polypody, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen fronds, which remain on the plant throughout the year, and its preference for moist, shaded environments. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in forest understories, where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive curled appearance that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Polypodium cochleatum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
