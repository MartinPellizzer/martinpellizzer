                    <h1>Plantago maritima var. tenuissima</h1>
<p>Plantago maritima var. tenuissima, commonly known as sea plantain or narrow-leaved plantain, is a coastal plant adapted to saline and sandy environments.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are borne on erect, branching stems. It is often found in salt marshes, dunes, and other coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh, windy conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
