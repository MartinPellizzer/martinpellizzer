<p>Pontederia martiusiana, commonly known as the purple rush or water hyacinth, is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking purple flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous stem. This aquatic plant thrives in wetland environments, often floating on the surface of still or slow-moving water. Its roots are adapted for absorbing nutrients from the water, making it a common invader in non-native waterways.</p>
