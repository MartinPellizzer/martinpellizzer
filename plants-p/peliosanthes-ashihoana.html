                    <h1>Peliosanthes ashihoana</h1>
<p>Peliosanthes ashihoana, commonly known as the Ashihona cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, a trait typical of cycads, and it has a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
