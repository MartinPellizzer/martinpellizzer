                            <h1>Potentilla Egedii Subsp. Yukonensis</h1>
<p>Yukon potentilla, scientifically known as Potentilla egedii subsp. yukonensis, is a resilient shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. This hardy plant thrives in cold climates and is often found growing in tundra and alpine environments. Its compact growth habit and vibrant yellow flowers make it a striking addition to northern landscapes. Yukon potentilla is well adapted to harsh conditions, including permafrost and poor soil, making it a symbol of ecological endurance. Due to its unique characteristics, it is also valued for its potential in landscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
