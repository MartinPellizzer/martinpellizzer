                    <h1>Polygonum amphibium f. serrulatum</h1>
<p>Polygonum amphibium f. serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated smartweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its erect, branching stems and alternate leaves with serrated edges.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, pond edges, and along streams, thriving in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are often borne on slender pedicels. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its adaptability to fluctuating water levels and its role in stabilizing aquatic and riparian ecosystems.</p>
