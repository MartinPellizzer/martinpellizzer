                    <h1>Paraceterach reynoldsii</h1>
<p>Paraceterach reynoldsii, commonly known as the Reynolds' staghorn fern, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique, tree-like appearance with a thick, branching stem and large, leathery fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates to support its growth. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are typically found on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
