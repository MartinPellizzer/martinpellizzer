                    <h1>Platanthera grandiflora f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Platanthera grandiflora f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered greater lady's-tresses, is a rare and striking orchid species native to certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, spiraled inflorescence composed of numerous white to pale pink flowers, which stand out against its dark green, grass-like foliage. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous habitats such as meadows and woodlands, often in areas with partial shade. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by moths, which are attracted to the plant's nocturnal blooming pattern and strong scent.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
