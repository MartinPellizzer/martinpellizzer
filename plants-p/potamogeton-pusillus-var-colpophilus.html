                    <h1>Potamogeton pusillus var. colpophilus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton pusillus var. colpophilus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide, which help it thrive in slow-moving or still waters. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found in shallow, nutrient-rich lakes and rivers. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its presence can indicate good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
