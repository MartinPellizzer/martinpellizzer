                    <h1>Phlegmariurus crassus var. manus-diaboli</h1>
<p>Phlegmariurus crassus var. manus-diaboli, commonly known as the Devil's Hand Lichens, is a species of crustose lichen found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its dark, leathery thallus with a distinct, almost bark-like appearance. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga, and a fungal partner from the genus Xanthoria. Its morphology includes a thick, homogeneous cortex with a central medulla that is often lighter in color.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its unique coloration and structural features, which contribute to its ecological and taxonomic significance.</p>
