                    <h1>Pulicaria mucronifolia</h1>
<p>Pulicaria mucronifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months, adding a subtle floral display to rocky or sandy soils. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean-style gardens.</p>
