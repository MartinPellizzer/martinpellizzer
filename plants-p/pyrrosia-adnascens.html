<p>Pyrrosia adnascens, commonly known as the crested fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, leathery fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive crest or ridge along the midrib. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Pyrrosia adnascens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
