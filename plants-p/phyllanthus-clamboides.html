                    <h1>Phyllanthus clamboides</h1>
<p>Phyllanthus clamboides, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling habit with dense clusters of small, fleshy, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its succulent leaves and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Phyllanthus clamboides is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
