                    <h1>Procris grueningii var. krausei</h1>
<p>Procris grueningii var. krausei, commonly known as the Krause's procris, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil to flourish. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
