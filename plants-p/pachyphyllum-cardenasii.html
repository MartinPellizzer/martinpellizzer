<p>Pachyphyllum cardenasii, commonly known as the Cardenas pachyphytum, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the blooming season. Its leaves are typically spiny, serving as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Pachyphyllum cardenasii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
