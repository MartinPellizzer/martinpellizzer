                    <h1>Piofontia rangelii</h1>
<p>Piofontia rangelii, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and ability to store water in its leaves. It blooms during the spring and early summer, relying on pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
