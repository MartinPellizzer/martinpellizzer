                    <h1>Poa mariae f. vivipara</h1>
<p>Poa mariae f. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous meadow grass, is a rare and distinctive grass species characterized by its unique reproductive feature.</p>
<p>This plant exhibits vivipary, a phenomenon where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant, forming small seedlings that can detach and establish new growth. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils in alpine or subalpine regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
