<p>Pteridrys catenata, commonly known as the chain fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds that form a cascading, chain-like structure.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to various regions in the Southern Hemisphere, including South America and Australia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, lanceolate pinnae arranged in a regular pattern.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori along the margins of the pinnae.</p>
