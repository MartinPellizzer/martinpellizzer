<p>Panicum unciphyllum f. prostratum, commonly known as prostrate false panicgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass species native to parts of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy and have a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping for erosion control.</p>
