<p>Polypodium leucophorum, commonly known as the white-veined fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, light green fronds with prominent white veins, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid environments, relying on air and rain for nutrients. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, spongy layer that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi-directionally pinnate, with small, ovate leaflets arranged in a distinctive pattern.</p>
