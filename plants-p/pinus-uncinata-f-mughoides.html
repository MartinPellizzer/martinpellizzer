                    <h1>Pinus uncinata f. mughoides</h1>
<p>Pinus uncinata f. mughoides, commonly known as the Mughal pine, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Spanish pine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and conical shape, typical of the Pinaceae family. This form exhibits unique morphological traits, including shorter and more clustered needles compared to the typical species. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and valuable component of its native flora.</p>
