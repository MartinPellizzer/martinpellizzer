<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow central disk. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes on its leaves and stems, which contribute to its natural insect-repelling properties. Pyrethrum yabrudae is valued in botanical gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>Its flowers bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
