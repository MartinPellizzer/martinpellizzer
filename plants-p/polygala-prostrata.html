                    <h1>Polygala prostrata</h1>
<p>Polygala prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, delicate flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, arranged in racemes along the stems. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Polygala prostrata is often found in rocky outcrops and along the edges of pans, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
