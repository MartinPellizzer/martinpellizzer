                    <h1>Persicaria japonica</h1>
<p>Persicaria japonica, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread aggressively and form dense stands. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a problematic species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
