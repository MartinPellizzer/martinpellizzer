<p>Parosela hegewischiana, commonly known as the mountain helleborine, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and its striking, showy flowers that range from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky slopes or in mountain forests. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer, and it is pollinated by specific insects such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
