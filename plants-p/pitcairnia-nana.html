                    <h1>Pitcairnia nana</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia nana, commonly known as the dwarf pitcairnia, is a small bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with small, colorful flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
