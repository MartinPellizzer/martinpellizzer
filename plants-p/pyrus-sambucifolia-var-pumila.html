                    <h1>Pyrus sambucifolia var. pumila</h1>
<p>Pyrus sambucifolia var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf sycamore, is a compact variant of the sycamore tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are similar in shape to those of the common sycamore but are typically smaller and more densely arranged. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, apple-like fruits that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and medicinal value, it is a valued plant in both horticulture and phytotherapy.</p>
