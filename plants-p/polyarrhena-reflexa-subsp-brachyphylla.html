<p>Polyarrhena reflexa subsp.</p>
<p>brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
