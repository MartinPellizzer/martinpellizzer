                    <h1>Paspalum sodiroanum var. terminale</h1>
<p>Paspalum sodiroanum var. terminale, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It is well adapted to sandy, coastal soils and can tolerate salt spray and periodic flooding.</p>
<p>This species is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ecological resilience and ability to stabilize dunes.</p>
