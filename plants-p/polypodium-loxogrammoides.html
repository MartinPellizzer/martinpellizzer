                    <h1>Polypodium loxogrammoides</h1>
<p>Polypodium loxogrammoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often clinging to trees or rocks. Its rhizomes are wiry and can form extensive networks, allowing it to anchor itself to various substrates.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
