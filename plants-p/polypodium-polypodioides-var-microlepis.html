                    <h1>Polypodium polypodioides var. microlepis</h1>
<p>Polypodium polypodioides var. microlepis, commonly known as the small-leaf rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a bright green color and a waxy texture. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates or in shaded, moist environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more refined leaves compared to the typical form of Polypodium polypodioides.</p>
