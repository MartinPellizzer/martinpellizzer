                    <h1>Pontederia sagittata</h1>
<p>Pontederia sagittata, commonly known as arrowhead, is a herbaceous wetland plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped to arrow-shaped leaves that are typically floating or emergent, depending on water conditions. The plant produces striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments like ponds, marshes, and along stream edges.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable wetland indicator and a potential invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
