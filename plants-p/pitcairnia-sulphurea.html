                    <h1>Pitcairnia sulphurea</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia sulphurea, commonly known as the sulfur plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks without deriving nutrients from its host. Its leaves form a rosette that collects rainwater, creating a microhabitat for various small organisms.</p>
<p>The plant's vibrant coloration and unique growth habit make it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation.</p>
