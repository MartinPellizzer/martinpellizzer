<p>Polypodium eriophorum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that have a silvery appearance due to the dense covering of tiny scales on the underside. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas, where it can thrive in cool, humid conditions. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Polypodium eriophorum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance.</p>
