<p>Paepalanthus warmingianus, commonly known as the Amazonian sunflower, is a striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that resemble sunflowers, which bloom in clusters at the top of its slender, branching stems. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in the moist, warm climate.</p>
<p>Paepalanthus warmingianus plays an important ecological role by attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
