<p>Pronephrium xiphioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments where it can absorb nutrients from captured insects. Its leaves are slender and often submerged, while its flowers are small and white or pale pink.</p>
