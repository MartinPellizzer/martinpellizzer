                    <h1>Pyrrosia adnascens f. calcicola</h1>
<p>Pyrrosia adnascens f. calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola fern, is a rare variant of the Pyrrosia adnascens species.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern typically found in rocky or calcareous soils, which is reflected in its specific epithet "calcicola," meaning "dwellers of calcium.". The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive, narrow shape that helps it thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in specific microhabitats.</p>
