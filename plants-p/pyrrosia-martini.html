                    <h1>Pyrrosia martini</h1>
<p>Pyrrosia martini, commonly known as the Martini's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has pinnately divided fronds with a leathery texture and dark green, glossy leaves. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Pyrrosia martini is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
