<p>Physurus claviger, commonly known as the spiny puffer or spiny sea hare, is a species of sea hare found in tropical and subtropical marine environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aplysiidae and is characterized by its elongated, soft body covered in small, spiny projections. The plant, though not a true plant, is a type of mollusk, and its body is typically adorned with a variety of colored patterns. It feeds primarily on algae and other marine plants, playing a role in coastal ecosystem dynamics.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for marine biology studies.</p>
