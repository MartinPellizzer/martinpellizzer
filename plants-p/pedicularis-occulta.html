                    <h1>Pedicularis occulta</h1>
<p>Pedicularis occulta, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its fleshy, scale-like structures for photosynthesis. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often resembling orchids in appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on the roots of trees or in shaded, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Pedicularis occulta is considered a protected species in many regions.</p>
