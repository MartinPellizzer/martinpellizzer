<p>Pedilonum brachyphyta, commonly known as the short-stemmed moss, is a small, carpet-like moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has dense, compact growth habit with short, upright stems covered in leaf-like structures called phyllidia. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape and have a smooth or slightly rough surface. It reproduces through spores released from capsules that develop on the stems.</p>
<p>This species is often found in forest floors and rocky crevices, contributing to soil stabilization and moisture retention.</p>
