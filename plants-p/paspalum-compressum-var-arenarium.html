<p>Paspalum compressum var. arenarium, commonly known as sand paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are adapted to withstand drought and salt spray. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes, coastal plains, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is used in erosion control and as a ornamental plant in xeriscaped landscapes.</p>
