                    <h1>Pugetia globularis</h1>
<p>Pugetia globularis, commonly known as the globular pincushion cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical, spiny structure, which helps it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant features small, green, fleshy stems that store moisture, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is an ideal plant for low-maintenance gardens.</p>
