                    <h1>Pedicularis dunniana</h1>
<p>Pedicularis dunniana, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while conducting photosynthesis. The plant features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forests or on rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
