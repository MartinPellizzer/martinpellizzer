<p>Pleopeltis papuana, commonly known as the Papuan pleopeltis, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Papua and nearby islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricately veined fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of fine roots, which help it absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually leathery and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens.</p>
