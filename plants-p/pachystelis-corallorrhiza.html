                <h1>Pachystelis corallorrhiza</h1>
<p>Pachystelis corallorrhiza, commonly known as the coral root orchid, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, thread-like roots and small, inconspicuous flowers that often resemble those of its host. This orchid is typically found in forested areas where it attaches to the roots of other plants, such as trees or shrubs. Its life cycle is closely tied to the health and availability of its host, making it an indicator of ecosystem stability.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized nature, it is often rare and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive.</p>
