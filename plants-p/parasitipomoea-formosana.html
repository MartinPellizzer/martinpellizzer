<p>Parasitipomoea formosana, commonly known as the Taiwan parasitic morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple. It typically grows in forested areas and is adapted to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
