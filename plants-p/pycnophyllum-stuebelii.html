                    <h1>Pycnophyllum stuebelii</h1>
<p>Pycnophyllum stuebelii, commonly known as the Stuebel's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is native to parts of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile, and thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health and growth of its host trees.</p>
