<p>Panicum stipitatum, commonly known as the clustered panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects or as a ornamental plant.</p>
