<p>Parrya stenocarpa var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-fruit parrya, is a rare and distinctive member of the Ericaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves and smooth, glabrous fruit surface, which set it apart from other varieties within the species. Native to the high elevations of the western United States, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
