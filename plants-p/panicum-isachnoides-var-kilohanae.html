<p>Panicum isachnoides var. kilohanae, commonly known as the Kiholana panicgrass, is a rare grass species native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and streamside areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
