                    <h1>Pleopeltis minima</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis minima, commonly known as the small pleopeltis, is a small epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss. Its rhizomes are short and branched, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate.</p>
<p>Pleopeltis minima is prized in horticulture for its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor growing conditions.</p>
