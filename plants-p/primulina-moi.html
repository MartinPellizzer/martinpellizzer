                    <h1>Primulina moi</h1>
<p>Primulina moi, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance, with a silvery sheen on the underside of the leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. It produces small, white flowers that are followed by spore-bearing structures, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.</p>
