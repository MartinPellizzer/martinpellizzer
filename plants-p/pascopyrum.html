                    <h1>Pascopyrum</h1>
<p>Pascopyrum, commonly known as wild wheat, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into seeds enclosed in aé¢– (lemma and palea). Pascopyrum species are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>These plants are of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to their potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to harsh environments.</p>
