<p>Pinguicula ovata, commonly known as the common butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant's leaves are covered in tiny, hair-like structures that secrete digestive enzymes. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wetlands.</p>
<p>Pinguicula ovata is often used in botanical gardens for its unique appearance and ecological significance.</p>
