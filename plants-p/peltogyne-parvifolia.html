                    <h1>Peltogyne parvifolia</h1>
<p>Peltogyne parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved ironwood, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and small, ovate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, flat pods containing seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its durable wood, it has been historically used for construction and furniture, though it is now considered vulnerable due to habitat loss.</p>
