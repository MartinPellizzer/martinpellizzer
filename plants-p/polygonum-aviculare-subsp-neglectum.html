<p>Polygonum aviculare subsp.</p>
<p>neglectum, commonly known as common knotgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features prostrate or ascending stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it a common weed in cultivated environments.</p>
