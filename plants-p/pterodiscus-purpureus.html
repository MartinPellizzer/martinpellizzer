                    <h1>Pterodiscus purpureus</h1>
<p>Pterodiscus purpureus, commonly known as the purple disc fern, is a rare and striking member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that display a distinctive purple hue, particularly on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Pterodiscus purpureus is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
