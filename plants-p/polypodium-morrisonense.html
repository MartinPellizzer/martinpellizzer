<p>Polypodium morrisonense, commonly known as Morrison's hart's-tongue fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Polypodium morrisonense is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
