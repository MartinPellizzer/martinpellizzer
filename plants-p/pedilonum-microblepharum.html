                    <h1>Pedilonum microblepharum</h1>
<p>Pedilonum microblepharum, commonly known as the small-eyed pedilonum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact stature and small, intricately shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers with petals that are pale violet to white in color, often with a subtle blush of pink. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
