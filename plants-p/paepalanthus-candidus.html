                    <h1>Paepalanthus candidus</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus candidus, commonly known as the white-barked peacock flower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble peacock feathers, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to the cool, dry conditions of its native habitat. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture.</p>
<p>However, it is considered rare and is often cultivated in controlled environments due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>
