                    <h1>Polygala petitiana var. calceolata</h1>
<p>Polygala petitiana var. calceolata, commonly known as the small-flowered milkvetch, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
