<p>[WRONG START] Pyrus communis f. troba, commonly known as the three-lobed pear.</p>
<p>This variant of the common pear is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are deeply lobed and give the plant a unique appearance. The foliage is typically dark green and glossy, providing an ornamental value in gardens. It produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by edible fruit that is similar to the common pear but often smaller and more flavorful.</p>
<p>While it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental qualities, it can also be grown for fruit production in suitable climates.</p>
