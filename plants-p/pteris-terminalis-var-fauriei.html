                    <h1>Pteris terminalis var. fauriei</h1>
<p>Pteris terminalis var. fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's water fern, is a variant of the common water fern.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new fronds that are often shorter than those of the standard Pteris terminalis.</p>
<p>The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
