                    <h1>Pilea ophiticola</h1>
<p>Pilea ophiticola, commonly known as the stone liver plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rocks or in rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
