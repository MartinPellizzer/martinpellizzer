                    <h1>Peltopus artostigma</h1>
<p>Peltopus artostigma, commonly known as the star-spotted bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, which it then digests for nutrients. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in tiny, translucent leaves that help in photosynthesis. Its unique morphology allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor waters by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
<p>Despite its carnivorous nature, it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling microorganism populations.</p>
