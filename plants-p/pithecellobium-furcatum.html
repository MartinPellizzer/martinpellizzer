<p>Pithecellobium furcatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed acacia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody pods containing edible, sweet-smelling seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and potential for erosion control, it is cultivated in some regions for horticultural purposes.</p>
