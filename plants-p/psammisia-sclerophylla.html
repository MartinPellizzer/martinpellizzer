                    <h1>Psammisia sclerophylla</h1>
<p>Psammisia sclerophylla, commonly known as the coastal lichen, is a unique plant that thrives in harsh, arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth form, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are typically covered in a thick layer of lichen, providing additional protection from extreme weather. It is often found in coastal areas where it withstands high salinity and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, Psammisia sclerophylla plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
