                    <h1>Phoradendron serotinum var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Phoradendron serotinum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are typically red or yellow. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fruits, contributing to its spread across different host species.</p>
<p>The plant's parasitic nature means it derives nutrients from its host, often causing minor to moderate damage to the host tree.</p>
