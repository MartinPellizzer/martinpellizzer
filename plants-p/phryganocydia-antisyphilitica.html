<p>Phryganocydia antisyphilitica, commonly known as the syphilis worm plant, is a rare and little-studied species belonging to the family Gelechiidae.</p>

The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, often growing in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are typically unisexual, with separate male and female structures, which is a notable botanical feature.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
