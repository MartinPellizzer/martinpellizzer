                    <h1>Pachypleurum mutellinoides</h1>
<p>Pachypleurum mutellinoides, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it a common weed in agricultural settings.</p>
