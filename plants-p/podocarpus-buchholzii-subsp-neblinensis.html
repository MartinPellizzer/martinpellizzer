<p>Podocarpus buchholzii subsp.</p>
<p>neblinensis, commonly known as the Neblin's podocarp, is a small evergreen tree native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that are arranged spirally along the stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, typical of the Podocarpaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
