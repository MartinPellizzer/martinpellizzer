<p>Platyopuntia vitelliniflora, commonly known as the yellow-flowered prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its succulent structure. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils.</p>
