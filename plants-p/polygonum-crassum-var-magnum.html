<p>Polygonum crassum var. magnum, commonly known as giant knotweed, is a vigorous perennial herb native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 20 cm in diameter, with a coarse, rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, sturdy stems. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in non-native regions.</p>
