                    <h1>Pinguicula brachyloba</h1>
<p>Pinguicula brachyloba, commonly known as the short-stalked butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or boggy habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted for nutrient-poor soils by capturing and digesting prey.</p>
