<p>Panicum blackii, commonly known as black panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in full sun and is often found in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and drought tolerance make it both a valuable forage crop and a challenging weed to manage.</p>
