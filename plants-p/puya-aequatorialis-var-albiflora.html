                    <h1>Puya aequatorialis var. albiflora</h1>
<p>Puya aequatorialis var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered torch plant, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean highlands of South America.</p>
<p>This perennial plant is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that bears numerous white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are long, strap-like, and often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a popular subject in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
