                    <h1>Pedicularis munzurdaghensis</h1>
<p>Pedicularis munzurdaghensis, commonly known as the Munzur Mountains monkey orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Turkey.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Pedicularis, which includes over 400 species of flowering plants commonly referred to as louse plants due to their unique seed dispersal mechanism. The plant is characterized by its striking red and yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer and attract specific pollinators. It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it forms a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pedicularis munzurdaghensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat degradation.</p>
