<p>Phaius lyonii, commonly known as the Lyon's spider orchid, is a striking terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and a single, showy flower that resembles a spider in appearance, hence its common name. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces a distinctive, intricate flower with a greenish-yellow lip and prominent calli. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or clay soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Phaius lyonii is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
