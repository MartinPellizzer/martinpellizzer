<p>Potamogeton × fluitans var. stagnatilis, commonly known as the floating pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with the lower portion submerged. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. It reproduces through both sexual and asexual means, often spreading via stolons that root at the nodes.</p>
<p>Its presence can influence water quality and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
