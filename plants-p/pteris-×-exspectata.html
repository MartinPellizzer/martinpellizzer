                    <h1>Pteris × exspectata</h1>
<p>Pteris × exspectata, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between *Pteris cretica* and *Pteris multifida*.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching and often display a bluish-green hue. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in spreading the plant across the substrate.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually 30–60 cm long and have a feathery appearance, making it a popular ornamental plant in water gardens.</p>
