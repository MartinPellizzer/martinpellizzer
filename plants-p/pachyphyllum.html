                    <h1>Pachyphyllum</h1>
<p>Pachyphyllum, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a genus of succulent plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing them to survive in harsh, dry environments. The leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss by minimizing surface area exposed to the sun. Pachyphyllum species produce small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, often during the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>They are popular among cactus and succulent enthusiasts for their low maintenance and ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
