<p>Peltopus thelantyx, commonly known as the silverleaf cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, feathery foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are scale-like and covered in a silvery-white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous cones that mature to release seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude environments.</p>
