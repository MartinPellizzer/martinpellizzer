                    <h1>Papyrus giganteus</h1>
<p>Papyrus giganteus, commonly known as giant papyrus, is a tall, reed-like plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length, with a smooth, grass-like texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown in color, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stalk. It thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of lakes.</p>
<p>Its fibrous stalks were historically used by ancient Egyptians for paper-making, though it is now primarily valued for ornamental purposes in wetland gardens.</p>
