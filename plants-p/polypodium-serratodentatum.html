                    <h1>Polypodium serratodentatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium serratodentatum, commonly known as the serrate toothed polypody, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a lush green appearance throughout the year.</p>
