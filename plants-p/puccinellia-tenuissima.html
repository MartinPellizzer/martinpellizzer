                    <h1>Puccinellia tenuissima</h1>
<p>Puccinellia tenuissima, commonly known as slender needlegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in degraded areas.</p>
