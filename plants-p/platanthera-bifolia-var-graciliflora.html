                    <h1>Platanthera bifolia var. graciliflora</h1>
<p>Platanthera bifolia var. graciliflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to certain regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and wetlands. It has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variant is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
