<p>Pyrrhocactus neohankeanus f. woutersianus, commonly known as the Wouters' pyrrhocactus, is a rare and striking cactus species native to a limited region in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green or reddish in color, adorned with prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and cactus enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
