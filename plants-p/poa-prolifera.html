                    <h1>Poa prolifera</h1>
<p>Poa prolifera, commonly known as the spreading meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often spread along the ground through rhizomes. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to blue-gray flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to form dense mats, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
