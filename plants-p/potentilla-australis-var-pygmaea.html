                    <h1>Potentilla australis var. pygmaea</h1>
<p>Potentilla australis var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous or high-altitude habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
