                    <h1>Polypogon radicans</h1>
<p>Polypogon radicans, commonly known as匍匐狗尾草, is a low-growing perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with rhizomes that spread along the ground, enabling it to colonize various habitats. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that helps it blend into its environment.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
