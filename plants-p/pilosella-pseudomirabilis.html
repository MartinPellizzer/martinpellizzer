                    <h1>Pilosella pseudomirabilis</h1>
<p>Pilosella pseudomirabilis, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to arid conditions. Its hairy leaves and compact growth habit help reduce water loss, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Pilosella pseudomirabilis is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
