                    <h1>Polypodium lanceolatum var. elisabethae</h1>
<p>Polypodium lanceolatum var. elisabethae, commonly known as the Elisabeth's shield fern, is a rare variant of the shield fern genus Polypodium.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>This variant is prized for its unique morphology and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
