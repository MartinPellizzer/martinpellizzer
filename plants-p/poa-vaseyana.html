                    <h1>Poa vaseyana</h1>
<p>Poa vaseyana, commonly known as the Vasey's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both florets and sterile lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Poa vaseyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments.</p>
