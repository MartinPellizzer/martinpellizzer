                    <h1>Psephellus poluninii</h1>
<p>Psephellus poluninii, commonly known as the Polunin's psephellus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its small, white flowers bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in pollinator habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
