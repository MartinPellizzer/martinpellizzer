<p>Polypodium crispatum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds that give it a unique, textured appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in certain conditions, which is a rare trait among ferns.</p>
