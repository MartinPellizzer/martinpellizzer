<p>Psoralea imbricata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy surface, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Psoralea imbricata is also notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
