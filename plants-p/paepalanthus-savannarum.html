<p>It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats like grasslands and savannas.</p>
