<p>Platanus × acerifolia f. kelseyana, commonly known as the Kelsey's London plane, is a unique hybrid species within the Platanaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of maple trees, though it retains the overall structure of the plane tree. This cultivar is notable for its distinctive, deeply incised leaf margins and a more compact growth habit compared to its parent species. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in urban environments.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its tolerance to pollution and its role in providing shade in city landscapes.</p>
