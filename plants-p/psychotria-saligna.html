                    <h1>Psychotria saligna</h1>
<p>Psychotria saligna, commonly known as the "arrow poison plant," is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often climbing stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of alkaloids, particularly tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which contributes to its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of psychoactive compounds.</p>
<p>Psychotria saligna is also known for its role in the preparation of curare, a potent neurotoxin used in indigenous hunting practices.</p>
