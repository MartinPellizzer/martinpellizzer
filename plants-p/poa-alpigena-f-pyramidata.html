                    <h1>Poa alpigena f. pyramidata</h1>
<p>Poa alpigena f. pyramidata, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a variant of the alpine bentgrass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in horticulture for erosion control and ornamental purposes.</p>
