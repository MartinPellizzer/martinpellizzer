<p>Pottsia, commonly known as the moss-like plant, is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leafy structures and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plants lack true roots and instead have rhizoids that anchor them to surfaces. Pottsia species are often used in ecological studies due to their sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
<p>They play a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in their habitats.</p>
