<p>Paraserianthes lophantha, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a large, evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark bark and long, narrow leaves that are often clustered at the base of the branches. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, woody pods containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions.</p>
