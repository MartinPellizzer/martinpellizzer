<p>These shrubs are characterized by their clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The berries that follow are typically bright red or blue and are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Phusicarpos species are often found in temperate regions, growing in woodland edges and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Their foliage and berries contribute to the ecological diversity of their native habitats.</p>
