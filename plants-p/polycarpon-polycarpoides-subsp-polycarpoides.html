<p>Polycarpon polycarpoides subsp.</p>
<p>polycarpoides, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and opposite, and it produces small, white or pink flowers that are often clustered together.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its specialized adaptations for aquatic life and its role in the ecosystem as both a predator and a food source.</p>
