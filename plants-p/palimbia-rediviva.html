                    <h1>Palimbia rediviva</h1>
<p>Palimbia rediviva, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a unique species of liverwort that exhibits remarkable desiccation tolerance.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marchantiaceae and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. The plant can survive extreme drought conditions by entering a state of metabolic dormancy, appearing completely dry and dead. When exposed to moisture, it rapidly rehydrates and regains its green, leafy appearance.</p>
<p>This adaptive trait has earned it the nickname "resurrection plant" due to its ability to "come back to life.".</p>
