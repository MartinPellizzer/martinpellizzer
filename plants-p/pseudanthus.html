                    <h1>Pseudanthus</h1>
<p>Pseudanthus, commonly known as a composite flower head, is a botanical term used to describe a group of flowers that appear to form a single flower due to their close arrangement.</p>
<p>These structures are typically composed of multiple small flowers, known as florets, which are tightly packed together. In many cases, the individual flowers are not visible, as they are covered by modified leaves called bracts. This arrangement is common in the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and chrysanthemums.</p>
<p>The pseudanthium serves both an aesthetic and functional role, aiding in pollination by mimicking the appearance of a single, showy flower.</p>
