                    <h1>Phryne peyrousiana</h1>
<p>Phryne peyrousiana, commonly known as the Crimson Rock Orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, vibrant red flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with fleshy, dark green leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
