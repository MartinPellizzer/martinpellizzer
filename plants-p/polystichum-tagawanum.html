<p>Polystichum tagawanum, commonly known as the Tagawan holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain throughout the year. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
