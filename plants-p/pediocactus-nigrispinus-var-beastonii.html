                    <h1>Pediocactus nigrispinus var. beastonii</h1>
<p>Pediocactus nigrispinus var. beastonii, commonly known as the Black-spined Hedgehog Cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, spiny areoles, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its dark, spiny structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
