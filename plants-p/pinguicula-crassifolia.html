<p>Pinguicula crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features broad, fleshy leaves that are covered in a sticky mucus to trap small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and rocky crevices. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers during the spring or summer months.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
