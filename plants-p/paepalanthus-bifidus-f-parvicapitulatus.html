                    <h1>Paepalanthus bifidus f. parvicapitulatus</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus bifidus f. parvicapitulatus, commonly known as the dwarf-headed pincushion cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded stems that are typically green to blue-green in color, covered with dense, white spines. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate contrast to its spiny structure. Its short stature and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival.</p>
