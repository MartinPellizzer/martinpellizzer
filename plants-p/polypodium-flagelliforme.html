                    <h1>Polypodium flagelliforme</h1>
<p>Polypodium flagelliforme, commonly known as the resurrection fern, is a species of epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like fronds that can curl into a compact ball when dry and unroll when exposed to moisture. This unique adaptation allows it to survive periods of drought by reducing water loss. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, forming dense, green patches that are often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its ability to revive after desiccation has made it a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
