<p>Poa glauca subsp.</p>
<p>kitadakensis, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it thrive in harsh alpine environments.</p>
<p>The plant typically forms compact tufts with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny blue to violet flowers, which are adapted for pollination by wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
