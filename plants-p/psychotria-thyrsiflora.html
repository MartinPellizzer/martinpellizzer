                    <h1>Psychotria thyrsiflora</h1>
<p>Psychotria thyrsiflora, commonly known as the "Amazonian arrow poison" or "curare plant," is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white to greenish flowers. The plant is notable for containing alkaloids such as d-tubocurarine, which have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a neurotoxin in hunting. Its leaves and roots are often processed to extract these compounds, making it an important species in both ethnobotanical and pharmacological studies.</p>
<p>Psychotria thyrsiflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in the complex ecosystems of the Amazon basin.</p>
