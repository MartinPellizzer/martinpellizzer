                    <h1>Papaver armenii</h1>
<p>Papaver armenii, commonly known as Armenian poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red or orange petals that resemble those of the common poppy, though it is smaller in size. The plant produces a capsule fruit that contains numerous small, dark seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a wildflower in horticultural collections.</p>
