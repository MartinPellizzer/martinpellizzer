<p>Posoqueria macrantha, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, waxy leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant produces showy, white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense mats.</p>
<p>Posoqueria macrantha plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration.</p>
