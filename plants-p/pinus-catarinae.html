                    <h1>Pinus catarinae</h1>
<p>Pinus catarinae, commonly known as the Catarina pine, is a species of conifer native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds.</p>
<p>The Catarina pine plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
