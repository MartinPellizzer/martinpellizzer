                    <h1>Phyllorkis bowkettiae</h1>
<p>Phyllorkis bowkettiae, commonly known as the Bowkett's ghost fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in dense undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its leaves, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
