<p>Panax murrayi, commonly known as the Murray ginseng, is a rare and elusive plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, branched root system and dark green, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Panax murrayi is considered a threatened species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
