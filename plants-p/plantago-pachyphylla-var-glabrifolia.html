                    <h1>Plantago pachyphylla var. glabrifolia</h1>
<p>Plantago pachyphylla var. glabrifolia, commonly known as the hairyleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, a feature adapted to its drought-prone environment. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaf pubescence compared to other varieties of Plantago pachyphylla.</p>
