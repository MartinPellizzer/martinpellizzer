<p>Pothuava triticina, commonly known as the wheat rust fungus, is a significant plant pathogen that affects wheat crops.</p>
<p>It belongs to the fungal genus Puccinia and causes a type of rust disease known as stem rust. The fungus overwinters as a sexual stage on barberry plants, which serve as alternate hosts. It spreads through airborne spores, leading to severe yield losses in wheat fields.</p>
<p>Its impact on global food security underscores the importance of monitoring and managing this disease.</p>
