                    <h1>Penstemon pumilus</h1>
<p>Penstemon pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf beardtongue, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically reaches heights of only a few inches, featuring dense clusters of tubular, violet to blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is well adapted to rocky and dry environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Penstemon pumilus is also valued for its role in supporting native pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
