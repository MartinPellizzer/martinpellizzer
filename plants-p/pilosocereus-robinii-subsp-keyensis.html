<p>Pilosocereus robinii subsp.</p>
<p>keyensis, commonly known as the Key Island cactus, is a species native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. It is a small, spiny cactus with a globular or cylindrical stem that is often covered in white or pale spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
