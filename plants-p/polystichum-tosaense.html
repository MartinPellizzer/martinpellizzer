                    <h1>Polystichum tosaense</h1>
<p>Polystichum tosaense, commonly known as the Tosa holly fern, is a rare and endemic species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
