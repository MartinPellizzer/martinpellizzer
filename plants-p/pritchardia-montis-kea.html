                    <h1>Pritchardia montis-kea</h1>
<p>Pritchardia montis-kea, commonly known as the Kea Mountain Pritchardia, is a rare and endemic palm species native to the Hawaiian island of Moloka ªi.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane rainforest habitats. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered, with very few mature individuals remaining in the wild.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique botanical species.</p>
