                    <h1>Pilostyles globosa var. caymanensis</h1>
<p>Pilostyles globosa var. caymanensis, commonly known as the Cayman Islands ghost flower, is a unique parasitic plant native to the Cayman Islands.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other vegetation. The plant produces striking, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the early morning. It is notable for its ephemeral nature, with flowers often wilting by midday.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
