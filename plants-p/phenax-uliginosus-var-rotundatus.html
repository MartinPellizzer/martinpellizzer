<p>Phenax uliginosus var. rotundatus, commonly known as the round-leaved fen orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in northern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of broad, rounded leaves and produces striking, showy inflorescences of violet-blue flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires consistent moisture, often found in bogs and marshes. Its morphology is adapted to its wetland environment, with specialized root systems that help it withstand waterlogged conditions.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its ecological significance and its role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
