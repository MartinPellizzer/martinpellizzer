                    <h1>Pritchardia lanigera</h1>
<p>Pritchardia lanigera, commonly known as the hairy cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal and lowland areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pritchardia lanigera is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
