<p>Petasites hybridus subsp.</p>
<p>ochroleucus, commonly known as the yellow meadow saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its large, spoon-shaped leaves. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a dense cluster, which bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its pale yellow flowers and broader, more rounded leaves compared to other Petasites species.</p>
