                    <h1>Persea corymbosa</h1>
<p>Persea corymbosa, commonly known as the Mexican avocado or the green avocado, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and fragrant, white flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that are typically harvested when they are still green, though they ripen off the tree. The fruit's pericarp contains a single large seed surrounded by a creamy, nutrient-rich pulp.</p>
<p>This plant is valued not only for its edible fruit but also for its ornamental value and use in traditional medicine.</p>
