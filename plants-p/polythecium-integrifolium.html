<p>Polythecium integrifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leafed polypody, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with smooth margins and a light green to pale yellowish hue. It produces small, spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a common sight in temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
