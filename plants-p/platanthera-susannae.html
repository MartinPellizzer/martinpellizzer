                    <h1>Platanthera susannae</h1>
<p>Platanthera susannae, commonly known as the Susan's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and a long, spiraled inflorescence of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and bogs, often in association with mycorrhizal fungi. It has a slender, rhizomatous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
