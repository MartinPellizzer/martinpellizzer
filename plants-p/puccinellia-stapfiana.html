                    <h1>Puccinellia stapfiana</h1>
<p>Puccinellia stapfiana, commonly known as the Tibetan glassworts, is a flowering plant species belonging to the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to high-altitude regions of Asia, including the Tibetan Plateau, where it thrives in arid and cold environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often appear glassy due to their translucent appearance. Its small, spike-like inflorescences bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many grasses.</p>
<p>Puccinellia stapfiana plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates.</p>
