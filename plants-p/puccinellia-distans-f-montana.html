                    <h1>Puccinellia distans f. montana</h1>
<p>Puccinellia distans f. montana, commonly known as the mountain sandreed, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with narrow, blue-green leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed sites such as roadsides and dunes. Its ability to tolerate drought and saline conditions makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
<p>The inflorescence structure and leaf morphology are key botanical features that distinguish it from other Puccinellia species.</p>
