<p>Poa triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. The plant is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear three florets each. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it thrive in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Poa triflora is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
