                    <h1>Pogonia ophioglossoides var. minor</h1>
<p>Pogonia ophioglossoides var. minor, commonly known as the small ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands, often on the bases of trees or in leaf litter. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, and it has a short, erect stem that supports its unique floral structure.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring careful conservation efforts.</p>
