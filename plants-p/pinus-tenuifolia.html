                    <h1>Pinus tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Pinus tenuifolia, commonly known as the coast redwood, is a species of conifer native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically less than an inch in length. The tree produces small, reddish-brown cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in coastal forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to the humid, foggy conditions of its native habitat.</p>
