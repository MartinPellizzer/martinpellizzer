                    <h1>Polypodium hoozanense</h1>
<p>Polypodium hoozanense, commonly known as the Hoozan holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in forest understories.</p>
