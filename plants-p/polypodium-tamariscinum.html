<p>Polypodium tamariscinum, commonly known as the tamarisk fern, is a species of fern native to southern China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi-colored, with a light green upper surface and a darker green underside. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective flap.</p>
<p>Polypodium tamariscinum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
