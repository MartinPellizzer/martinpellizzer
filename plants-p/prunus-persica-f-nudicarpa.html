                    <h1>Prunus persica f. nudicarpa</h1>
<p>Prunus persica f. nudicarpa, commonly known as the naked-sepaled peach, is a unique cultivar of the peach tree characterized by its distinctive floral morphology.</p>
<p>Unlike typical peaches, this variety exhibits a reduced or absent calyx, giving it a more open appearance. The plant retains the general botanical features of Prunus persica, including its deciduous nature and drupaceous fruits. It is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal rather than its fruiting capabilities.</p>
<p>The foliage remains similar to other peach varieties, with lobed leaves and a moderate growth habit.</p>
