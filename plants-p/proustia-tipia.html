<p>Proustia tipia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, often blooming during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Proustia tipia is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies.</p>
