<p>Parosela fremontii var. wheeleri, commonly known as the Wheeler's parosela, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in specific regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
