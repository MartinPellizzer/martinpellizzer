<p>Picea excelsa f. megalolepis, commonly known as the giant white spruce, is a rare and distinctive variant of the white spruce species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its exceptionally large cones, which can reach lengths of up to 12 centimeters, making it one of the largest cone-bearing forms within the genus Picea. The foliage consists of long, slender needles that are typically a dark green color, with a slightly bluish tinge on the upper surface. This form is native to specific regions in the Himalayas, where it thrives in high-altitude, cold environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
