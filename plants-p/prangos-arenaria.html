                    <h1>Prangos arenaria</h1>
<p>Prangos arenaria, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and is well adapted to arid and sandy environments. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Prangos arenaria is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
