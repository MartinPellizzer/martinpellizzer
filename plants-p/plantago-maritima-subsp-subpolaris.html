<p>Plantago maritima subsp.</p>
<p>subpolaris, commonly known as the polar plantain, is a perennial herb native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in moist, coastal or tundra environments, where it thrives in cold climates.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, with a robust root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
