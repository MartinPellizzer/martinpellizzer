                    <h1>Pterygodium newdigateae var. cleistogamum</h1>
<p>Pterygodium newdigateae var. cleistogamum, commonly known as the cleistogamous pterygodium, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae, characterized by its leguminous properties and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. The plant is notable for producing both cleistogamous (closed) and chasmogamous (open) flowers, a reproductive strategy that enhances its chances of successful pollination. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with small, ovate leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits containing seeds.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique reproductive biology and ecological adaptations.</p>
