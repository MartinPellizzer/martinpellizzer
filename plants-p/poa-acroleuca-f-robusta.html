                    <h1>Poa acroleuca f. robusta</h1>
<p>Poa acroleuca f. robusta, commonly known as the robust bentgrass, is a variant of the bentgrass species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine environments. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are tightly clustered, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings for its fine texture and ability to form lush, green lawns.</p>
