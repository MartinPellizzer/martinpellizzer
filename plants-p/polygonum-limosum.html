                    <h1>Polygonum limosum</h1>
<p>Polygonum limosum, commonly known as yellow knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland areas in North America.</p>
<p>It has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly in moist environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a reddish tint when young.</p>
<p>Polygonum limosum is often found in marshes, along stream banks, and in other wet habitats where it thrives in saturated soil conditions.</p>
