                    <h1>Phyllochilium</h1>
<p>Phyllochilium, commonly known as the liverworts, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the division Marchantiophyta.</p>
<p>These plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments and are often found on rocks, soil, or decaying wood. Phyllochilium species are characterized by their leaf-like structures, which are usually arranged in a rosette or layered pattern. They lack true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having structures called thallus that absorb water and nutrients directly.</p>
<p>Due to their small size and preference for humid conditions, they play an important role in ecological systems as pioneer species in moist habitats.</p>
