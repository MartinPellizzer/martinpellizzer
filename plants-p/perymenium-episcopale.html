<p>Perymenium episcopale, commonly known as the bishop's perymenium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, white or greenish flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some areas.</p>
