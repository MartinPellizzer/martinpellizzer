<p>Piper nubigenum, commonly known as the cloud forest pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the humid, high-altitude regions of Central and South America, particularly in the cloud forests of Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems that often trail along the forest floor or ascend through the canopy. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped, with a glossy surface and a strong, peppery aroma.</p>
<p>The small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and the fruit is a small, three-lobed berry that ripens to a dark purple color.</p>
