                    <h1>Panicum balanites</h1>
<p>Panicum balanites, commonly known as the Balanites grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are often dispersed by animals, contributing to its spread in disturbed and marginal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
