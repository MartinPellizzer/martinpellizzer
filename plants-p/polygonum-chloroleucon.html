                    <h1>Polygonum chloroleucon</h1>
<p>Polygonum chloroleucon, commonly known as the white knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its upright stems, heart-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wet meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
