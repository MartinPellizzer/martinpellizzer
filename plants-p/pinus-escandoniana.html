                    <h1>Pinus escandoniana</h1>
<p>Pinus escandoniana, commonly known as the Escandon pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its long, needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often found in cloud forests. Its botanical features include a straight trunk and a conical crown, typical of many pine species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
