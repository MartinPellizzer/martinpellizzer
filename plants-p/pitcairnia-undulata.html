<p>Pitcairnia undulata, commonly known as the undulating pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, which is used for nourishing its aerial roots. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia undulata is appreciated in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
