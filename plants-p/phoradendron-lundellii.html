                    <h1>Phoradendron lundellii</h1>
<p>Phoradendron lundellii, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Caribbean, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host trees for water and nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds. The plant has a distinctive appearance with smooth, glossy leaves and a woody stem that grows directly into the host tree's branches. It is native to parts of Central and South America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host if left unchecked, making it an important subject in ecological studies.</p>
