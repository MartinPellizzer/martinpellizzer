The tree produces cones that are cylindrical and often persist on the branches for many years. It thrives in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and longevity, it is considered a valuable species for studying ecological and evolutionary processes.</p>
