<p>Paralophia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silver or grayish foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine hairs on the leaves. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Paralophia species produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and their fruits are capsules that split open to release seeds.</p>
<p>These plants are adapted to withstand drought conditions, making them resilient in harsh environments.</p>
