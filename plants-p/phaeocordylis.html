                    <h1>Phaeocordylis</h1>
<p>Phaeocordylis, commonly known as the ghost mushroom, is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Tricholomataceae.</p>
<p>These fungi are characterized by their pale, often ghostly appearance, with a cap that can range from white to pale yellow or even reddish in some species. They typically grow in temperate regions, often on decaying wood or in leaf litter. Phaeocordylis species are saprophytic, decomposing organic matter and playing a role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Their delicate structure and unique coloration make them both ecologically significant and visually intriguing.</p>
