                    <h1>Potentilla impolita var. flabellata</h1>
<p>Potentilla impolita var. flabellata, commonly known as the flabellate cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in rockeries or alpine gardens.</p>
