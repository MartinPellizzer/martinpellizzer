<p>Phlegmariurus gagnepainianus, commonly known as the Gagnepain's haircap, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green, glossy leaves that are often curved and covered with a layer of tiny, translucent cells. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its sporophytes are relatively short, with a single, elongated capsule that matures to release spores.</p>
<p>This moss is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche.</p>
