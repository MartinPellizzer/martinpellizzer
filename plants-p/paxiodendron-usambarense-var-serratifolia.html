                    <h1>Paxiodendron usambarense var. serratifolia</h1>
<p>Paxiodendron usambarense var. serratifolia, commonly known as the Usambara cedar, is a rare and endemic tree species native to the Usambara Mountains in Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense canopy, with leaves that are alternate and narrowly elliptic. The plant exhibits a unique morphological adaptation to its mountainous habitat, including a thick bark that provides resistance to fire and pests. It produces small, clustered flowers followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, this species is critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts.</p>
