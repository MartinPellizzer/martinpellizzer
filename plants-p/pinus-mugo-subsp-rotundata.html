<p>Pinus mugo subsp.</p>
<p>rotundata, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a compact evergreen conifer native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its short, twisted trunk and dense, spherical crown, which gives it a distinctive, gnarled appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are needle-like, typically ranging from 1 to 2 centimeters in length, and are arranged in spirals around the stem. It produces small, pale yellow cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and it is well adapted to harsh, rocky environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
