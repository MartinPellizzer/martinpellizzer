<p>Pogogyne serpylloides subsp.</p>
<p>intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate bog sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other moist environments.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
