<p>Pocockia ruthenica, commonly known as the Ruthenian fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in linear rows on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Pocockia ruthenica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
