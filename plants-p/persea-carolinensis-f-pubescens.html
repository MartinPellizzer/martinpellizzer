                    <h1>Persea carolinensis f. pubescens</h1>
<p>Persea carolinensis f. pubescens, commonly known as the Florida persimmon, is a variant of the persimmon tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy or pubescent leaves, which distinguish it from the typical smooth-leaved form. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange to reddish fruits, which are edible when fully ripe. The leaves are typically elliptical with a pointed tip and have a rough, textured surface.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and its fruit, which is often used in culinary applications.</p>
