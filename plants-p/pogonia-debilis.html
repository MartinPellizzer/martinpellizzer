<p>Pogonia debilis, commonly known as the weak pogonia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific soil conditions for successful growth. The plant produces a single, erect stem with a single, showy violet or purple flower. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
