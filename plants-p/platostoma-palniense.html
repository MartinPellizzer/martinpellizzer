                    <h1>Platostoma palniense</h1>
<p>Platostoma palniense, commonly known as the Palni rock fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found in the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and possesses fronds that are typically leathery and covered in a dense layer of rhizomes. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
