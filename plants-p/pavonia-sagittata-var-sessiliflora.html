                    <h1>Pavonia sagittata var. sessiliflora</h1>
<p>Pavonia sagittata var. sessiliflora, commonly known as the narrowleaf pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens.</p>
<p>The varietal form, sessiliflora, is distinguished by its sessile (nearly leafless) flower stems, which set it apart from other varieties of Pavonia.</p>
