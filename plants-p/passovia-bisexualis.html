                    <h1>Passovia bisexualis</h1>
<p>Passovia bisexualis, commonly known as the twin-flowered orchid, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that display a blend of purple and white hues. The plant produces both male and female reproductive structures on the same individual, a trait known as bisexuality. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Passovia bisexualis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
