<p>Periploca vomitoria, commonly known as the vomiter's plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Apocynaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Canary Islands and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, waxy leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or yellowish flowers, which are followed by distinctive, orange-red berries. Its name is derived from the historical belief that it caused vomiting, though this effect is not well substantiated.</p>
<p>Periploca vomitoria is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to thrive in sunny, well-drained soils.</p>
