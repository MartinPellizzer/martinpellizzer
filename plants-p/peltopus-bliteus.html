                    <h1>Peltopus bliteus</h1>
<p>Peltopus bliteus, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh environments.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
