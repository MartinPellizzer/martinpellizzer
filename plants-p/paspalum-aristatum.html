<p>Paspalum aristatum, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland and marshy areas, thriving in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, delicate flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Paspalum aristatum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to waterlogged environments.</p>
