                    <h1>Prescottia ophioglossoides</h1>
<p>Prescottia ophioglossoides, commonly known as the Mexican holly fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, which is characterized by its primitive and often unusual morphology. The plant has a short, erect rhizome with a single, pinnately compound leaf that is often divided into several segments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaf blades.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Prescottia ophioglossoides is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
