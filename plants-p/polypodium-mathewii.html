<p>Polypodium mathewii, commonly known as the Mathew's sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, evergreen fronds that grow in a dense, upright manner. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.
