                    <h1>Platanthera bifolia f. brevicalcarata</h1>
<p>Platanthera bifolia f. brevicalcarata, commonly known as the short-spurred lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that feature a pouch-like structure called a labellum, which is typically pink or white in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
