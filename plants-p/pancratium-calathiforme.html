                    <h1>Pancratium calathiforme</h1>
<p>Pancratium calathiforme, commonly known as the golden arum, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, showy inflorescences with a spathe that resembles a helmet, hence its common name. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that are pollinated by insects, particularly flies and beetles. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The foliage is broad and arrow-shaped, contributing to its ornamental value in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes.</p>
