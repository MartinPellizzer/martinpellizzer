                    <h1>Platanthera minax</h1>
<p>Platanthera minax, commonly known as the small ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, leafless stem that produces a single, showy white or pale green flower. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it highly dependent on its symbiotic relationships. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
