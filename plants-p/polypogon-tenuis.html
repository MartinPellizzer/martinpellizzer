                    <h1>Polypogon tenuis</h1>
<p>Polypogon tenuis, commonly known as slender flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, such as marshes and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with rhizomes that help it spread and establish in moist conditions.</p>
