<p>Potentilla supina subsp.</p>
<p>tunetica, commonly known as the prostrate cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its sprawling habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
