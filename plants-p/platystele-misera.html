                    <h1>Platystele misera</h1>
<p>Platystele misera, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed small-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often underground rhizomes and its small, delicate leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces tiny, white to pale green flowers that bloom during the wet season, often in clusters near the base of the foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Platystele misera is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
