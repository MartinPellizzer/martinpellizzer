<p>Physaria integrifolia var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain flax or desert bluemink, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces striking blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is distinct from the typical form due to its more robust growth and slightly different floral characteristics.</p>
