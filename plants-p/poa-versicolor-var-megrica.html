                    <h1>Poa versicolor var. megrica</h1>
<p>Poa versicolor var. megrica, commonly known as the variable bluegrass, is a variant of the bluegrass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, which are typical of the Poa genus. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly rolled, with a bluish-green hue that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along the edges of woodlands, where it contributes to the structural diversity of the vegetation.</p>
