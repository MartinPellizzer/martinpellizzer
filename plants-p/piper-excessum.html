                    <h1>Piper excessum</h1>
<p>Piper excessum, commonly known as the giant pepper plant, is a climbing shrub native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species like black pepper. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its fruit, which resembles a peppercorn, is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated than other pepper varieties due to its specific growing requirements.</p>
