<p>Parodia carrerana, commonly known as the Carrera's pincushion cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a compact, spiny structure that resembles a pincushion. The plant features short, cylindrical stems covered in white to pale blue spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the areoles in the spring.</p>
<p>Parodia carrerana is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and exhibiting succulent characteristics.</p>
