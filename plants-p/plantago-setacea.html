                    <h1>Plantago setacea</h1>
<p>Plantago setacea, commonly known as the curly dock, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of broad, wavy, and hairy leaves that form a dense cluster near the ground. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in fields, and near water sources.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common and persistent weed in many regions.</p>
