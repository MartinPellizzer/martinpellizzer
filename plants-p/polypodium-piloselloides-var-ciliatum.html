                    <h1>Polypodium piloselloides var. ciliatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium piloselloides var. ciliatum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the polypodium genus native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are dark green and covered in fine, hairy structures. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>The varietal distinction of *ciliatum* is primarily based on the presence of cilia-like structures on the fronds, which set it apart from other variants within the species.</p>
