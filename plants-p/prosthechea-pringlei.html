<p>Prosthechea pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Prosthechea pringlei is a rare and endangered species, threatened by habitat loss and deforestation.</p>
