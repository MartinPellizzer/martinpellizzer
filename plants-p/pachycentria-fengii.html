                    <h1>Pachycentria fengii</h1>
<p>Pachycentria fengii, commonly known as the Feng's thick-ribbed cactus, is a unique species native to arid regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, spiny structure. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Pachycentria fengii is valued for its resilience and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
