<p>Pseudoligandra, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plants are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to yellow. Pseudoligandra species are typically drought-tolerant, making them well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
<p>They produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in their propagation in dry, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
