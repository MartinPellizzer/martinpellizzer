                <h1>Pimpinella thomasii</h1>
<p>Pimpinella thomasii, commonly known as Thomas' cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like flower clusters.</p>
<p>Native to the western United States, particularly California, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, ribbed fruit that splits open upon maturity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
