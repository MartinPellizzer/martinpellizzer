                    <h1>Platanthera ovata</h1>
<p>Platanthera ovata, commonly known as the oval lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to moist woodlands and meadows in North America.</p>
<p>It features a slender, erect stem with a dense cluster of narrow, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and possesses a unique, grass-like foliage. It is pollinated primarily by flies and beetles due to its lack of strong fragrance.</p>
<p>Platanthera ovata is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions, requiring specific habitat conditions for successful growth.</p>
