                <h1>Pfaffia iresinoides</h1>
<p>Pfaffia iresinoides, commonly known as curcuma, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its ornamental, sword-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant is often cultivated for its striking foliage rather than its flowers, which are less showy. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, fertile soil.</p>
<p>Pfaffia iresinoides is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though more research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses.</p>
