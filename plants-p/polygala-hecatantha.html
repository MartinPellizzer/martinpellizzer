<p>Polygala hecatantha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its unique, orchid-like appearance with white, tubular flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has small, scale-like leaves and produces flowers that are pollinated by specific insects, primarily flies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many states.</p>
