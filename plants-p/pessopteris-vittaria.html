<p>Pessopteris vittaria, commonly known as the veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The fronds are pinnately divided with a distinct midrib and are covered in small, scale-like structures. This plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
