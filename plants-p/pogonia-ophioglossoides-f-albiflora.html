                    <h1>Pogonia ophioglossoides f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Pogonia ophioglossoides f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered bog orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and fens, where it thrives in nutrient-poor conditions. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This orchid is also notable for its symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake.</p>
