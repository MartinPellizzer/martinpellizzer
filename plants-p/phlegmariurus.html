                    <h1>Phlegmariurus</h1>
<p>Phlegmariurus, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of vascular plants belonging to the order Lycopodiales.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, scale-like leaves and their ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Phlegmariurus species are typically found in temperate and tropical regions, often growing in dense clusters on rocky or acidic soils. They reproduce via spores, which are released from sporangia located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Despite their ancient lineage, some species of Phlegmariurus are still used in traditional medicine and horticulture.</p>
