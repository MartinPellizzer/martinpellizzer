<p>Puccinellia arjinshanensis, commonly known as the Xinjiang needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 (tufted) growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local ecosystems in its native habitat.</p>
