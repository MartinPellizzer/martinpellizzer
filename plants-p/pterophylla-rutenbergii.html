                    <h1>Pterophylla rutenbergii</h1>
<p>Pterophylla rutenbergii, commonly known as the Rutenberg's pterophylla, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the arid regions of Israel.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its growth habit is low and spreading, allowing it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pterophylla rutenbergii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and human activity.</p>
