<p>Phymatosorus novae-zealandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a distinctive evergreen fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sturdy trunk and large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a unique structure with a central trunk composed of tightly packed rhizomes, which provide structural support. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a rare trait among ferns, and it plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to the moist, temperate climate of New Zealand's forests.</p>
