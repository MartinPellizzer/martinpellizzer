                    <h1>Potentilla tanacetifolia f. erecta</h1>
<p>Potentilla tanacetifolia f. erecta, commonly known as the upright potentilla, is a compact, shrubby plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, upright growth with small, bright green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow, daisy-like flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings due to its drought tolerance and preference for well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its compact form and vibrant floral display.</p>
