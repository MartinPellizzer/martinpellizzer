<p>Polypodium griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments, and the plant produces sporangia on the underside of the leaves.</p>
