                    <h1>Petroedmondia</h1>
<p>Petroedmondia, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Petroedmondia is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
