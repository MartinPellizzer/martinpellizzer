<p>Pronephrium debile, commonly known as the weak kidney fern, is a delicate fern species native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically light green and slightly hairy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new shoots along their length. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Pronephrium debile prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
