<p>Periploca aphylla, commonly known as the leafless periploca, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only small, scale-like structures present instead. The plant produces yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
