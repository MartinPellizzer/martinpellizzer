<p>Pyrus ormastonii, commonly known as the Ormaston pear, is a rare and ancient species of pear native to the Scottish Highlands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elongated fruit that typically ripens in late summer. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are oval in shape with a rough texture. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
