                    <h1>Potentilla apennina f. skelensis</h1>
<p>Potentilla apennina f. skelensis, commonly known as the Skelentian cinquefoil, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Potentilla genus.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its finely divided, silver-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to specific regions in the Mediterranean, particularly in southern Italy, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
