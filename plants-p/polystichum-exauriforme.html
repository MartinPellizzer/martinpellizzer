<p>Polystichum exauriforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in clusters called sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Polystichum exauriforme is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to add texture to woodland gardens.</p>
