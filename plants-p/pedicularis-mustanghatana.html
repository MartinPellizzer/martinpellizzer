<p>Pedicularis mustanghatana, commonly known as the Mustang hat flower, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its hemiparasitic nature.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas, where it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often resembling a hat or helmet, hence its common name. It has opposite, lance-shaped leaves and relies on a network of roots to absorb nutrients from host plants.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
