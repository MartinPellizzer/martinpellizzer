                    <h1>Pollinia irritans</h1>
<p>Pollinia irritans, commonly known as the irritant orchid, is a tropical plant characterized by its unique floral structure and pollination mechanism.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to regions in South America, particularly Brazil. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that attract specific pollinators, such as bees and wasps. One of its most distinctive features is the presence of pollinia, which are masses of pollen that adhere to the bodies of visiting insects.</p>
<p>These pollinia are often described as irritant due to their ability to cause allergic reactions in some individuals.</p>
