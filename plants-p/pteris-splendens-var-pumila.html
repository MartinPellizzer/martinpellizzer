                    <h1>Pteris splendens var. pumila</h1>
<p>Pteris splendens var. pumila, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a type of epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>It features fronds that are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a distinctive, rugged texture resembling the antlers of a stag. The plant's spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are often covered in a dense, hairy layer. It requires well-draining, loose soil and indirect sunlight to flourish.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to grow on trees or in hanging baskets.</p>
