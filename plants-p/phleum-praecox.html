                    <h1>Phleum praecox</h1>
<p>Phleum praecox, commonly known as early meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers in early summer. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
<p>Phleum praecox is also valued for its role in traditional livestock grazing.</p>
