                    <h1>Polygala carphoides</h1>
<p>Polygala carphoides, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It relies on a network of host trees, such as oaks and hickories, for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis to some extent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in spikes, and it is pollinated by insects. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique parasitic relationship and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
