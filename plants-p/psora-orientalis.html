                    <h1>Psora orientalis</h1>
<p>Psora orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern psora, is a rare and elusive plant species native to specific regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically less than a meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forests or along riverbanks. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on wind pollination for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, Psora orientalis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
