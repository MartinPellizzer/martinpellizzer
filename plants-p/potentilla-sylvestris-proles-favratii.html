                    <h1>Potentilla sylvestris proles favratii</h1>
<p>Potentilla sylvestris proles favratii, commonly known as the Alpine Cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with woody stems and small, palmately divided leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
