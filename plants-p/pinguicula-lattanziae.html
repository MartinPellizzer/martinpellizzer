                    <h1>Pinguicula lattanziae</h1>
<p>Pinguicula lattanziae, commonly known as the Lattanzia butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects, a key adaptation for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
