                    <h1>Primulina malipoensis</h1>
<p>Primulina malipoensis, commonly known as the Malipo stonecrop, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant features fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically small, tubular, and brightly colored, usually in shades of red or orange, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
