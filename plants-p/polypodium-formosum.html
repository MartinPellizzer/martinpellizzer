<p>Polypodium formosum, commonly known as the Formosan wall-rue, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, particularly Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Polypodium formosum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also of interest in botanical research due to its ecological significance.</p>
