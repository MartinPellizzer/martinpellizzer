                    <h1>Polypogon × lagascae</h1>
<p>Polypogon × lagascae, commonly known as the hybrid switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between *Polypogon monogonus* and *Polypogon punctatus*, exhibiting traits from both parent species. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and potential for erosion control, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
