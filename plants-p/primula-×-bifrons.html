                    <h1>Primula × bifrons</h1>
<p>Primula × bifrons, commonly known as the hybrid primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>The hybrid nature of Primula × bifrons results from crosses between different species within the Primula genus, contributing to its genetic diversity and adaptability.</p>
