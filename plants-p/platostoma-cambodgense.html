                    <h1>Platostoma cambodgense</h1>
<p>Platostoma cambodgense, commonly known as the Cambodian flat lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid tropical environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, flat thallus with a distinctive greenish-brown coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide the photosynthetic capability necessary for survival. It is typically found on tree trunks and rocks in the understory of dense forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
