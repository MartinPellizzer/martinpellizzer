<p>Panicum hackelii, commonly known as Hackel's panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments.</p>
