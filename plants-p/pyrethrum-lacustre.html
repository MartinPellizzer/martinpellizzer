<p>Pyrethrum lacustre, commonly known as water pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant produces small, spiky seed heads that contain the insecticidal compounds pyrethrin and piperonyl butyrate. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its natural pest-repelling properties, it is often used in organic gardening and as a natural pesticide.</p>
