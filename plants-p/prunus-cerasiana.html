                    <h1>Prunus cerasiana</h1>
<p>Prunus cerasiana, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, single or double pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, sweet-tart fruits that are edible but not as commonly consumed as other apricots. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge, adding to its visual appeal.</p>
