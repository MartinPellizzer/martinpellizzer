                    <h1>Puna clavarioides f. cristata</h1>
<p>Puna clavarioides f. cristata, commonly known as the cristate coral fungus, is a unique variant of the coral fungus genus Clavarioides.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive branched, coral-like structure that resembles a branching tree or a cluster of small, delicate stems. This fungal form typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as the Andean p√°ramo, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its spore-bearing surface is usually found on the tips of its branches, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
