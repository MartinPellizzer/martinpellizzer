<p>Pteris vittata, commonly known as the brake fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate fronds that are often bright green with a distinctive yellow or brown midrib. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky soils or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, allowing it to spread easily in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Pteris vittata is also known for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts.</p>
