                    <h1>Paludorchis × lloydiana</h1>
<p>Paludorchis × lloydiana, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a natural hybrid between Paludorchis alpina and Paludorchis falcata.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands and marshes of Europe, particularly in regions with moist, calcareous soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems with a single, showy white or pale pink flower that blooms in late spring or early summer. Its roots are adapted to aquatic environments, allowing it to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
