<p>Panicum scaberrimum, commonly known as rough bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains of pollen. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage crop for livestock.</p>
