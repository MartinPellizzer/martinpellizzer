<p>Paspalum burchellii, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa, South America, and parts of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species for arid environments.</p>
<p>Paspalum burchellii is often used in landscaping and for erosion control due to its resilience and minimal maintenance requirements.</p>
