<p>Pachygone yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan thickstem plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its robust, thick stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its foliage is usually dark green and dense, providing a striking visual contrast to its pale or white flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pachygone yunnanensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
