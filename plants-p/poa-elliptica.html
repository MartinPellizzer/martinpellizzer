                    <h1>Poa elliptica</h1>
<p>Poa elliptica, commonly known as the oval bluegrass, is a cool-season grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense turf-like vegetation. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread vegetatively, making it resilient in various soil conditions.</p>
<p>Poa elliptica is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed sites, contributing to ecological stability in its habitat.</p>
