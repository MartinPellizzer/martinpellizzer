<p>Phragmites australis subsp.</p>
<p>humilis, commonly known as the common reed, is a perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in marshes, lakeshores, and along riverbanks, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and filtering water. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to the structure of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant produces fluffy, feathery seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its widespread distribution.</p>
