                    <h1>Poa alpina var. brevifolia</h1>
<p>Poa alpina var. brevifolia, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in cold, high-altitude environments with well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny grains of pollen.</p>
<p>This variant is particularly adapted to harsh alpine conditions, making it a resilient component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
