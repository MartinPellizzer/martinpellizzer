                    <h1>Prosopostelma madagascariense</h1>
<p>Prosopostelma madagascariense, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers with intricate patterns of purple and white. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark and absorbing moisture from the humid air. Its botanical features include elongated, strap-like leaves and a compact, pseudobulbous structure that stores water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
