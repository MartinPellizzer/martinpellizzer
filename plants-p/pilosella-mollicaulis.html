                    <h1>Pilosella mollicaulis</h1>
<p>Pilosella mollicaulis, commonly known as the soft-stemmed goatweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats. Its leaves are softly hairy, giving it a velvety texture, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer.</p>
<p>Pilosella mollicaulis is generally considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain pollinators.</p>
