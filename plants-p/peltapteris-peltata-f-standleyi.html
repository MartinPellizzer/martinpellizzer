                    <h1>Peltapteris peltata f. standleyi</h1>
<p>Peltapteris peltata f. standleyi, commonly known as the Standley's frilled water fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Osmundaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are deeply lobed and often have a frilled margin, giving it a unique appearance. This fern is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in swampy areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns.</p>
<p>The plant is of interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance and its role in paleobotanical studies.</p>
