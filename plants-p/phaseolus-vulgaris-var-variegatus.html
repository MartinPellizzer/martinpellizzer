                    <h1>Phaseolus vulgaris var. variegatus</h1>
<p>Phaseolus vulgaris var. variegatus, commonly known as the variegated common bean, is a variant of the common bean plant characterized by its unique leaf patterns and color variations.</p>
<p>This plant belongs to the Fabaceae family and is native to the Americas, where it has been cultivated for centuries. Its leaves exhibit a striking mosaic of green, white, and sometimes yellow, due to genetic mutations affecting chlorophyll production. The variegation is a stable trait that does not typically affect the plant's growth or yield.</p>
<p>It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal, though it can also be used in culinary applications similar to other common beans.</p>
