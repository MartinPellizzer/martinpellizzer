<p>Phlegmariurus ambrensis, commonly known as the Ambrensis clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. This plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including strobila, are clustered at the tips of its stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
