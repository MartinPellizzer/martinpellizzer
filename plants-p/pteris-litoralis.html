                    <h1>Pteris litoralis</h1>
<p>Pteris litoralis, commonly known as the saltwater fern, is a species of fern native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, saline soils and is often found in tidal zones and along shorelines. The plant has feathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically grayish-green in color. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes help it anchor in loose, coastal substrates.</p>
<p>This hardy plant is well adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding.</p>
