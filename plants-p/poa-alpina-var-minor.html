                    <h1>Poa alpina var. minor</h1>
<p>Poa alpina var. minor, commonly known as the alpine meadow grass, is a variant of the alpine bentgrass native to mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, perennial grass with fine, tufted leaves that are adapted to cold and high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its ability to withstand harsh conditions makes it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
