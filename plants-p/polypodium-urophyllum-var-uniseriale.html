                    <h1>Polypodium urophyllum var. uniseriale</h1>
<p>Polypodium urophyllum var. uniseriale, commonly known as the single-row wall fern, is a variant of the common wall fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its upright, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage pattern, with a single row of sporangia, distinguishes it from other polypodium species.</p>
