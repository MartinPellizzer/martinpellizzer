                    <h1>Platystele pamelae</h1>
<p>Platystele pamelae, commonly known as the Pamelae's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique morphology, featuring a short, fleshy rhizome and a single, narrow leaf. The plant produces small, white flowers with a distinctive, elongated spur, typical of many epiphytic orchids. It is native to the cloud forests of Mexico and is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Platystele pamelae is considered critically endangered.</p>
