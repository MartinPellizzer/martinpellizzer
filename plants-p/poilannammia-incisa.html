<p>Poilannammia incisa, commonly known as the sharpleaf fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pinnately divided, serrated leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
