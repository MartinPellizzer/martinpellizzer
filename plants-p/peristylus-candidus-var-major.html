                    <h1>Peristylus candidus var. major</h1>
<p>Peristylus candidus var. major, commonly known as the white-flowered peristylus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a glossy surface that reflects light.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some conservation programs.</p>
