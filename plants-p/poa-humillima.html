                    <h1>Poa humillima</h1>
<p>Poa humillima, commonly known as the dwarf bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with fine, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
