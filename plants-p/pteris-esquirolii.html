<p>Pteris esquirolii, commonly known as the Esquiroli's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green and have a feathery appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
