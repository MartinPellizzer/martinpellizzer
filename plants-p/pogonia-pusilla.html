                    <h1>Pogonia pusilla</h1>
<p>Pogonia pusilla, commonly known as the small pink pogonia, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy pink or purple flower that blooms in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands, often near streams or in rich, humus-filled soil. Its small size and subtle appearance make it challenging to spot, contributing to its endangered status.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
