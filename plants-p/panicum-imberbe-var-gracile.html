                    <h1>Panicum imberbe var. gracile</h1>
<p>Panicum imberbe var. gracile, commonly known as slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and produces small, delicate spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soil conditions, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats.</p>
