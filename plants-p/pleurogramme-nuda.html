                    <h1>Pleurogramme nuda</h1>
<p>Pleurogramme nuda, commonly known as the naked pleurogramme, is a rare aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and ponds. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, with spores produced in clusters on the undersides of the leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality.</p>
