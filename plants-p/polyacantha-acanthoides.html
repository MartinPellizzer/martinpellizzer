<p>Polyacantha acanthoides, commonly known as the rough thornapple, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in stiff, spiny hairs, which provide a defensive mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a rough, hairy capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>The species is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
