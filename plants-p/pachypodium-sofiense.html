                    <h1>Pachypodium sofiense</h1>
<p>Pachypodium sofiense, commonly known as the Socotra cactus, is a unique succulent native to the island of Socotra in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, columnar stems that store water, adapted to the arid environment of its native habitat. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the evening, adding to its distinctive appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Pachypodium sofiense is a striking example of evolutionary adaptation in extreme climates.</p>
