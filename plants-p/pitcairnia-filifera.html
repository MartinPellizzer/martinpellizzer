                    <h1>Pitcairnia filifera</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia filifera, commonly known as the feather plant, is a bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central tank to collect water. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with bright red bracts that house small, white flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
