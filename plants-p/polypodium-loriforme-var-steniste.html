                    <h1>Polypodium loriforme var. steniste</h1>
<p>Polypodium loriforme var. steniste, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, arching fronds with lanceolate, dark green leaves that are densely packed along the stem. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves, a characteristic feature of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaf blades compared to the typical form of Polypodium loriforme.</p>
