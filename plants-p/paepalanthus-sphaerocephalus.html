                    <h1>Paepalanthus sphaerocephalus</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus sphaerocephalus, commonly known as the globular cholla, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that are covered in small, globose spines, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters at the ends of the stems, typically during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a specimen plant in arid gardens.</p>
