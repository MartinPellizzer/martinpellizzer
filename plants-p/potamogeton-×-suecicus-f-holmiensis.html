<p>Potamogeton × suecicus f. holmiensis, commonly known as the Holm's pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a submerged perennial that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often ribbon-like in appearance, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It is known for its ability to form dense underwater vegetation, which can provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions where it can outcompete native plants.</p>
