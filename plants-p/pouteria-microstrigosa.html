                    <h1>Pouteria microstrigosa</h1>
<p>Pouteria microstrigosa, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes. The tree's most notable feature is its edible seeds, which are encased in a hard, woody shell and are commercially valuable as Brazil nuts. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires a warm, tropical climate for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Pouteria microstrigosa plays a significant role in both ecological systems and the global nut trade.</p>
