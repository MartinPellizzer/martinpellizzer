<p>Phyllostegia racemosa, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and its flowers are borne in clusters of two to five, typically opening in late spring. The flowers are pale yellow with five petals and are often accompanied by showy bracts.</p>
<p>Phyllostegia racemosa is adapted to moist, acidic soils and is commonly found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
