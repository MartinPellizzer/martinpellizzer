                    <h1>Pellaea profusa</h1>
<p>Pellaea profusa, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and small, dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops, walls, and in shaded, moist environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Pellaea profusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, rocky habitats.</p>
