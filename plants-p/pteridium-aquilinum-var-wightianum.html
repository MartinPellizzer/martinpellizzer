<p>Pteridium aquilinum var. wightianum, commonly known as the bracken fern, is a widespread fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length, with a dark green color and a serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands, clearings, and disturbed areas. It reproduces via spores, which are released from the sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
