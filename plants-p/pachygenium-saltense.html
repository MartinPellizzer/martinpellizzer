                    <h1>Pachygenium saltense</h1>
<p>Pachygenium saltense, commonly known as the salt marsh hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, succulent stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in saline and arid environments. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Pachygenium saltense plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
