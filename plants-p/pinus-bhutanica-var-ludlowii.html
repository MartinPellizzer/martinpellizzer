<p>Pinus bhutanica var. ludlowii, commonly known as the Bhutan fir, is a rare and endemic conifer found primarily in the Eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the shoots. The tree produces distinctive cones that are typically pendulous and have a reddish-brown color when mature. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often growing in dense forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
