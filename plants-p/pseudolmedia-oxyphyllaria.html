                    <h1>Pseudolmedia oxyphyllaria</h1>
<p>Pseudolmedia oxyphyllaria, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing structure with a dense rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, orchid-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in crevices, while its leaves are succulent, allowing it to store water efficiently.</p>
<p>Pseudolmedia oxyphyllaria is well-suited to arid environments and is often found in quartzite formations and dry riverbeds.</p>
