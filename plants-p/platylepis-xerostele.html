                    <h1>Platylepis xerostele</h1>
<p>Platylepis xerostele, commonly known as the desert lily, is a striking flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, a key adaptation to its dry environment. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in the spring. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to thrive in harsh, low-water conditions makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
