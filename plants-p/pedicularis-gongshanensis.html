<p>It belongs to the genus Pedicularis, which is part of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its hemiparasitic nature. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it relies on host plants for some of its nutrients. Its flowers are usually reddish or orange in color, with a distinctive spurred structure that aids in pollination by insects.</p>
