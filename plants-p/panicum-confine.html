                    <h1>Panicum confine</h1>
<p>Panicum confine, commonly known as the narrow panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife, Panicum confine is valued in wetland restoration projects.</p>
