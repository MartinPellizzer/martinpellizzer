                    <h1>Ptilotus pedleyanus var. comosus</h1>
<p>Ptilotus pedleyanus var. comosus, commonly known as the clustered spinifex, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features dense, cylindrical clusters of small, spiky leaves that form a mat-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments with poor soil, exhibiting drought tolerance and resilience to salt and wind.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of coastal and inland arid ecosystems.</p>
