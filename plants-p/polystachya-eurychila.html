                    <h1>Polystachya eurychila</h1>
<p>Polystachya eurychila, commonly known as the broad-leafed pteridium, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polystachyaceae and is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The plant's robust rhizome system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in moist, tropical habitats.</p>
