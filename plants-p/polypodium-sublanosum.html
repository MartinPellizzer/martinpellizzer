                    <h1>Polypodium sublanosum</h1>
<p>Polypodium sublanosum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of polypody fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in a dense, velvety layer of trichomes, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is often thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
