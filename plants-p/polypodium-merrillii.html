<p>Polypodium merrillii, commonly known as the Chinese wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, and its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of moss-like tissue. Polypodium merrillii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
