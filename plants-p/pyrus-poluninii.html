                    <h1>Pyrus poluninii</h1>
<p>Pyrus poluninii, commonly known as the Polunin pear, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small deciduous tree or shrub that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to common pears. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Pyrus poluninii is facing significant threats to its survival.</p>
