                    <h1>Paspalum notatum var. eriorrhizon</h1>
<p>Paspalum notatum var. eriorrhizon, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to the warmer regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its fibrous root system, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It thrives in full sun and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a common species in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, often forming dense mats that can dominate native vegetation.</p>
