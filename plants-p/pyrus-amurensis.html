<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit, narrow leaves, and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in spring. The tree produces small, yellow pears that are typically edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and tolerance to cold climates.</p>
