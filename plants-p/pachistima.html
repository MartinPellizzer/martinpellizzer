                    <h1>Pachistima</h1>
<p>Pachistima, commonly known as the crevice plant or desert holly, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments. The plant has small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss, and it produces clusters of small, white or yellow flowers. Pachistima is well adapted to rocky soils and can survive in areas with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Its unique growth form and resilience make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
