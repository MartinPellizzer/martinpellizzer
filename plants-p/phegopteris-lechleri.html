<p>Phegopteris lechleri, commonly known as the giant h养成, is a fern species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, often used in traditional medicine.</p>
