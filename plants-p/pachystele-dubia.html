                    <h1>Pachystele dubia</h1>
<p>Pachystele dubia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, often appearing as if they are floating in the air. The plant has a short, thick stem and small, leathery leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pachystele dubia is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
