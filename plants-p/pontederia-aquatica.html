<p>Pontederia aquatica, commonly known as pickerelweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, depending on water levels. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Pickerelweed is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
