                    <h1>Parablechnum usterianum</h1>
<p>Parablechnum usterianum, commonly known as the slender lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It forms a dense, crust-like growth on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces. The thallus is typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a leathery texture. It lacks distinct leaves but has a complex network of filaments called rhizines that anchor it to its substrate.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
