Its flowers are small and yellow, with four petals, and it produces a unique type of silique, a dry fruit that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its morphological variation, particularly in leaf shape and pod structure, which contribute to its ecological adaptability.</p>
