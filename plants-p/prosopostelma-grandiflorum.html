                    <h1>Prosopostelma grandiflorum</h1>
<p>Prosopostelma grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It has small, scale-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat its fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
