<p>It has dark green, leathery leaves that are broad and oval in shape, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss in cold climates. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early summer, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and animals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments.</p>
<p>Pernettya crassifolia plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
