                    <h1>Pitcairnia corallina var. corallina</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia corallina var. corallina, commonly known as the coral pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for its epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant due to its preference for warm, humid conditions.</p>
