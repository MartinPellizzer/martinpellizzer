<p>Polygonum bistorta subsp.</p>
<p>carneum, commonly known as red bistort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, reddish stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, erect spikes. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges.</p>
