<p>Potamogeton pusillus var. berchtoldii, commonly known as the narrowleaf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 mm wide, arranged in whorls along its stem. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, which emerge from the water surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it both a valuable indicator species and a potential weed in some water bodies.</p>
