<p>Pseudobartsia, commonly known as the false bartsia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Primulaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are native to Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. These plants are typically small herbs with opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. They often grow in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas.</p>
<p>The genus is characterized by its unique floral structure and is of interest to botanists due to its taxonomic complexity and ecological adaptations.</p>
