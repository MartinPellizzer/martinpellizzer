                    <h1>Poa fenas</h1>
<p>Poa fenas, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it thrive in cold, nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. Its roots form dense mats that stabilize soil in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Poa fenas is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to colonize degraded alpine sites.</p>
