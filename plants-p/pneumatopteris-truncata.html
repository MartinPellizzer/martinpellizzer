<p>Pneumatopteris truncata, commonly known as the cut-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its fronds are typically light green and have a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Pneumatopteris truncata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
