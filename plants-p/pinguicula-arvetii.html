                    <h1>Pinguicula arvetii</h1>
<p>Pinguicula arvetii, commonly known as the Alpine butterwort, is a small carnivorous plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized glandular hairs on its leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant's leaves are succulent and often form a rosette shape, allowing it to retain moisture in its arid, mountainous habitat. It blooms with small, white or greenish flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
