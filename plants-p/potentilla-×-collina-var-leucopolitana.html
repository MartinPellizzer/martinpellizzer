                    <h1>Potentilla × collina var. leucopolitana</h1>
<p>Potentilla × collina var. leucopolitana, commonly known as the White Alpstraw, is a hybrid shrub native to the alpine regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, which are adaptations to its harsh, high-altitude environment. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, providing some protection against desiccation in cold, dry conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>
