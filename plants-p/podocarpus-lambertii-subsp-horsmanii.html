<p>Podocarpus lambertii subsp.</p>
<p>horsmanii, commonly known as the Horsman's podocarp, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its needle-like leaves and small, woody cones.</p>
<p>The plant is typically found in coastal and montane forest ecosystems, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role as a habitat provider and contributes to the biodiversity of its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
