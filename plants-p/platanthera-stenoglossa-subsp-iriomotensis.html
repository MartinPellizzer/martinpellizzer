<p>Platanthera stenoglossa subsp.</p>
<p>iriomotensis, commonly known as the Iriomote ghost orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid endemic to the island of Iriomote in Japan. It is characterized by its pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, narrow, and elongated lip.</p>
<p>The plant is epiphytic, growing on tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host, and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It thrives in humid, shaded forest environments, often in areas with high rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and is protected by conservation efforts in its native region.</p>
