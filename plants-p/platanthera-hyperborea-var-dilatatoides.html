                    <h1>Platanthera hyperborea var. dilatatoides</h1>
<p>Platanthera hyperborea var. dilatatoides, commonly known as the broad-leaf marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in wet meadows and bogs.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant has a short-lived root system and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common feature among orchids. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its moist habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
