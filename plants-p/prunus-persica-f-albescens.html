<p>Prunus persica f. albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered peach.</p>
<p>This botanical variant is a cultivar of the peach tree, characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which contrast with the typical pink or red blooms of standard peaches. The plant retains the general structure and growth habits of the common peach, with similar foliage and fruit-bearing capabilities. Its flowers are often more showy than those of the typical variety, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>The fruit, while edible, may be smaller and less flavorful compared to standard peaches, but it is still suitable for both culinary and ornamental purposes.</p>
