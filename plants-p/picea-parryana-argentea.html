<p>Picea parryana argentea, commonly known as the silver spruce, is a striking evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-blue foliage, which results from a dense layer of fine, overlapping scales on its needles. The tree typically grows to a moderate height, with a narrow, conical shape and a slow growth rate. Its cones are small and cylindrical, containing two to three seeds, and it produces them in the fall.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique color and hardiness.</p>
