                    <h1>Poa polyphylla f. compacta</h1>
<p>Poa polyphylla f. compacta, commonly known as the compact form of the mountain grass, is a variant of the native North American grass species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit, making it well-suited for rocky or disturbed soils. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. It is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
