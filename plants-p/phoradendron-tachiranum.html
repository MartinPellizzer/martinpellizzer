                    <h1>Phoradendron tachiranum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron tachiranum, commonly known as the Tachira mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host trees for water and nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Venezuela and Colombia. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. Its leaves are usually small and scale-like, and it has a complex relationship with its host, often causing structural weakening over time.</p>
<p>The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
