<p>Pandanus biceps, commonly known as the two-branched pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its large, strap-like leaves that grow in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber, but it also plays an ecological role in stabilizing coastal areas.</p>
