<p>Potentilla obscura subsp.</p>
<p>laciniosa, commonly known as the woolly cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant features silver-gray foliage due to a thick layer of fine, glandular hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its subspecies status is distinguished by its more elongated, laciniate (notched) leaves compared to the typical form.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude conditions.</p>
