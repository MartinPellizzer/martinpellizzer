                    <h1>Paepalanthus tortilis var. tortilis</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus tortilis var. tortilis, commonly known as the curly-leaved cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spirally arranged spines and fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the dry season, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and adapting it to harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology makes it a striking addition to xerophytic gardens and a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
