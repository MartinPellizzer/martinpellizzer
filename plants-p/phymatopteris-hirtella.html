<p>Phymatopteris hirtella, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia. The plant is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically dark green and develop sporangia on the underside, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
