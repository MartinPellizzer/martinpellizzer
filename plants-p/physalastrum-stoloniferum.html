<p>Physalastrum stoloniferum, commonly known as creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers are typically white or pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>Physalastrum stoloniferum is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats.</p>
