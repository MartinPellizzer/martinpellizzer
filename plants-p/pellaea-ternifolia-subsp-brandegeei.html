<p>Pellaea ternifolia subsp.</p>
<p>brandegeei, commonly known as the Brandegee's maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is often considered a vulnerable species.</p>
