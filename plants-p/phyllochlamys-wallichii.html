                    <h1>Phyllochlamys wallichii</h1>
<p>Phyllochlamys wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan star moss, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment. It is often found on rocky slopes and among sparse vegetation, thriving in cold and dry conditions.</p>
<p>Phyllochlamys wallichii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microscopic organisms in its ecological niche.</p>
