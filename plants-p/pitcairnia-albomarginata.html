                    <h1>Pitcairnia albomarginata</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia albomarginata, commonly known as the white-margin pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage, which forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking white and pink inflorescences that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
