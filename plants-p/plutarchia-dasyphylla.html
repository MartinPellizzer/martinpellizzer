<p>Plutarchia dasyphylla, commonly known as the woolly leaf shrub, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Plutarchia dasyphylla is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
