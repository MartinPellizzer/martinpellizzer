                    <h1>Procris lepidotula</h1>
<p>Procris lepidotula, commonly known as the white sand lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale to whitish thallus, which is often covered with a fine layer of dust-like particles. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and cyanobacteria, which contribute to its photosynthetic capabilities. It is typically found on bare soil, rocks, or dead wood in regions with low humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, Procris lepidotula is an important indicator species for environmental conditions in its habitat.</p>
