<p>Potamogeton roxburghianus, commonly known as the river grass, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Asia.</p>
<p>It has long, narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spikelets, and it is often found in slow-moving or still waters. Its roots help stabilize sediment, contributing to water clarity and habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Potamogeton roxburghianus is an important species in wetland ecosystems and can be used for phytoremediation.</p>
