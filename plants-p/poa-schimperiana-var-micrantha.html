<p>Poa schimperiana var. micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptation to extreme environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
