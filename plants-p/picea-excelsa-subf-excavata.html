<p>Picea excelsa subf.</p>
<p>excavata, commonly known as the Andes cedar, is a subshrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine wax layer.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, elongated cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically growing at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important ecological role in its mountainous habitat.</p>
