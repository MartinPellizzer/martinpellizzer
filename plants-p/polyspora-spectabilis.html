<p>Polyspora spectabilis, commonly known as the showy polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often bright green with a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in rows on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polyspora spectabilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
