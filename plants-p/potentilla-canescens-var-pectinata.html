<p>Potentilla canescens var. pectinata, commonly known as the silverleaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine, silky hairs, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, adding ornamental value to its landscape. It is typically found growing in rocky soils and alpine meadows, thriving in full sun.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
