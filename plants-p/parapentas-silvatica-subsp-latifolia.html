<p>Parapentas silvatica subsp.</p>
<p>latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf forest parapentas, is a rare and specialized plant species native to certain temperate forest regions. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils under partial to full shade, often found in the understory of deciduous forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
