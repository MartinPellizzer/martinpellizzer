                    <h1>Pseudosedum</h1>
<p>Pseudosedum, commonly known as ghost plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae.</p>
<p>These succulent plants are characterized by their fleshy, often blue-green leaves that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. They typically produce small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the spring or summer. Pseudosedum species are native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and many are cultivated as ornamental plants due to their aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Their ability to propagate through offsets makes them easy to grow and propagate in gardens and indoor settings.</p>
