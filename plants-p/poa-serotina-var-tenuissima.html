                    <h1>Poa serotina var. tenuissima</h1>
<p>Poa serotina var. tenuissima, commonly known as slender late-flowering grass, is a variant of the late-flowering grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, slender leaves and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for rocky or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom late in the growing season, typically in late summer or early autumn. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in drier conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the unique flora of these environments.</p>
