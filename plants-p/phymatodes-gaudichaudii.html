<p>Phymatodes gaudichaudii, commonly known as the Texas starburst lily, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a bulbous root system and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
