                    <h1>Physocarpus opulifolius var. tomentellus</h1>
<p>Physocarpus opulifolius var. tomentellus, commonly known as the silver-leaf ninebark, is a deciduous shrub native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its heart-shaped leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the summer, which are followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
<p>This variety is more compact than the typical ninebark, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces.</p>
