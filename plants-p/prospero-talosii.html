                <h1>Prospero talosii</h1>
<p>Prospero talosii, commonly known as the desert star cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with prominent, star-shaped spines that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem for survival in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and adaptations make it well-suited for desert environments.</p>
