                    <h1>Ponerorchis simplex</h1>
<p>Ponerorchis simplex, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a leafless epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant relies entirely on its specialized roots for absorption of water and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are pale green or white, with a unique structure that resembles a ghostly appearance, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered critically endangered and highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
