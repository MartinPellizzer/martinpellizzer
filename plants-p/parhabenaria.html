                    <h1>Parhabenaria</h1>
<p>Parhabenaria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, showy white or pale green flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and filtered sunlight, to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Parhabenaria is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
