                    <h1>Pyrrosia pachyderma</h1>
<p>Pyrrosia pachyderma, commonly known as the thick-leaf fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often covered in a thick layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round foliage in its natural habitat.</p>
