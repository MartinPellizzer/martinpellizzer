<p>Pyrenoglyphis aristata, commonly known as the spiny leaf fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often covered in small, spiny protrusions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under forest canopies. Its rhizome system helps it anchor to substrates and absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil.</p>
<p>The spiny structures on its leaves may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
