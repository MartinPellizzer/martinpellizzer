                    <h1>Prunus jamasakura f. hexapetala</h1>
<p>Prunus jamasakura f. hexapetala, commonly known as the six-petaled cherry blossom, is a unique variant of the Japanese cherry tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, double-flowered blooms that feature six petals instead of the typical five. This form is a natural mutation resulting from genetic variation within the Prunus jamasakura species. The flowers are highly ornamental, often appearing in dense clusters, adding a dramatic visual effect during the spring blooming season.</p>
<p>It is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and public spaces.</p>
