<p>Polypodium leveilleanum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly glossy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rock faces. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the margins of the fronds.</p>
