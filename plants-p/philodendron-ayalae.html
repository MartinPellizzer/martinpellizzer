<p>Philodendron ayalae, commonly known as the Ayal√° philodendron, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often a deep green with a slight variegation. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.
