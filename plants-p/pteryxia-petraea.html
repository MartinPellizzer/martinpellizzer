                    <h1>Pteryxia petraea</h1>
<p>Pteryxia petraea, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family and is a symbiotic composite organism consisting of a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky habitats, particularly on limestone and sandstone, and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant's thallus is typically crustose, forming a flat, adherent layer on the substrate. It plays a vital role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is also used as an indicator species for air quality.</p>
