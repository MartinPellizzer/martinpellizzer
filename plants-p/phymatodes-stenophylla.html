                    <h1>Phymatodes stenophylla</h1>
<p>Phymatodes stenophylla, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, fleshy leaves that store water, a key adaptation to its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, greenish-brown seed capsules. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Phymatodes stenophylla plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert insects and small animals.</p>
