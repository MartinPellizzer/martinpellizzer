                    <h1>Polychlaena ramosa</h1>
<p>Polychlaena ramosa, commonly known as the branched mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of white or yellowish flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which attach to the host's vascular system. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid forest environments.</p>
<p>Its presence can affect the health of its host tree, making it an ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
