<p>Petiniotia purpurascens, commonly known as the red-stemmed lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is known for its distinctive red or orange-colored medulla, which contrasts with its greenish or yellowish cortex. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its morphology includes a foliose thallus with a flat, leaf-like structure that aids in nutrient absorption and light capture.</p>
