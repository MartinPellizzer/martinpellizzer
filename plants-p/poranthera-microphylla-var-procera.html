                    <h1>Poranthera microphylla var. procera</h1>
<p>Poranthera microphylla var. procera, commonly known as the tall mountain dudleya, is a succulent plant native to the coastal mountains of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
