<p>Primula minima f. subacaulis, commonly known as the dwarf primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features compact rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained, humus-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and woodland borders.</p>
