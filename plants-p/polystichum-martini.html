                    <h1>Polystichum martini</h1>
<p>Polystichum martini, commonly known as the Martini fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found growing in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming compact clumps over time.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.</p>
