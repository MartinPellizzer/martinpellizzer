<p>Pedicularis laniflora, commonly known as the woolly monkeyflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, woolly stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically pink or red, with a distinctive shape that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
