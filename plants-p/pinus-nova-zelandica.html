<p>Pinus nova-zelandica, commonly known as the kahikatea, is a tall evergreen conifer native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender needles and can grow up to 50 meters in height. The tree has a straight trunk with a fluted, fibrous bark that is often covered in lichens. It thrives in wet, swampy environments and is adapted to the humid climate of the region.</p>
<p>The cones of Pinus nova-zelandica are woody and release seeds when mature, contributing to its reproductive cycle in the native ecosystem.</p>
