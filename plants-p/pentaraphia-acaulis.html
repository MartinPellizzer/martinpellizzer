                    <h1>Pentaraphia acaulis</h1>
<p>Pentaraphia acaulis, commonly known as the leafless rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its absence of true leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its fleshy, green stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Pentaraphia acaulis is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils, where it thrives with minimal water.</p>
