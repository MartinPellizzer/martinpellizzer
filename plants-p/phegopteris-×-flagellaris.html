                    <h1>Phegopteris × flagellaris</h1>
<p>Phegopteris × flagellaris, commonly known as the flagellar fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Phegopteris connectiva and Phegopteris hexandra.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized fern with long, arching fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The fronds are deeply divided into narrow, linear segments that give the plant its distinctive, flowing appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its fertile fronds, which bear sporangia on the underside, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
