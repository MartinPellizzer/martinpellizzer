                    <h1>Parosela leucantha</h1>
<p>Parosela leucantha, commonly known as the white parosela, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its striking white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or forested areas, and thrives in cool, moist climates. Its leaves are broad and oval-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parosela leucantha is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
