<p>Pandanus prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its creeping growth habit and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, which eventually develop into fibrous, edible fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and for thatching, while the plant itself thrives in coastal and wetland environments.</p>
<p>Pandanus prostratus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
