<p>Pedicularis lobatorostrata, commonly known as the horned poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, and its hairy, glandular stems. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, often at high elevations.</p>
<p>The leaves are opposite and usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
