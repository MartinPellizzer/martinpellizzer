This plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures include small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health.</p>
