                    <h1>Polypodium griffithianum</h1>
<p>Polypodium griffithianum, commonly known as the Griffith's fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
