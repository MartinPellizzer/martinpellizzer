<p>Phyllocosmus candidus, commonly known as the white-veined fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with prominent white veins. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
