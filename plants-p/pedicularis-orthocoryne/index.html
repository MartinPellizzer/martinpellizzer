                            <h1>Pedicularis Orthocoryne</h1>
<p>Pedicularis orthocoryne, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of Asia, it thrives in cold, high-altitude environments where few plants can survive. Its unique appearance, with a hood-like labellum and vivid red petals, makes it a subject of fascination for botanists and nature enthusiasts alike. This plant is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal relationships for nutrients. Despite its beauty, Pedicularis orthocoryne remains a challenging species to study due to its limited distribution and elusive nature.</p>
