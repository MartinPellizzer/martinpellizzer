                    <h1>Poa incurva</h1>
<p>Poa incurva, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its curved leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which makes it well-suited for ground cover. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to spread aggressively, often forming dense mats in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Poa incurva is often found in meadows, lawns, and along the edges of wetlands.</p>
