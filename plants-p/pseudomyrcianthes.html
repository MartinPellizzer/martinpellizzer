<p>Pseudomyrcianthes, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and includes several species that are often mistaken for the invasive Australian native plant, *Schinus terebinthifolius*. The plants are characterized by their small, clustered flowers and aromatic, often red or orange berries. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees and are adapted to a variety of soil types.</p>
<p>Pseudomyrcianthes species are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
