                    <h1>Pinguicula vulgaris f. albida</h1>
<p>Pinguicula vulgaris f. albida, commonly known as the white butterwort, is a variant of the butterwort plant characterized by its pale or white-colored leaves.</p>
<p>This carnivorous plant is native to certain regions of Europe and is adapted to grow in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are glandular and sticky, allowing it to trap small insects for nourishment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Despite its carnivorous nature, it plays a minor role in its ecosystem due to its limited size and habitat specificity.</p>
