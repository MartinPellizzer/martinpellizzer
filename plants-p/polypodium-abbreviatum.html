                    <h1>Polypodium abbreviatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium abbreviatum, commonly known as the dwarf cliff fern, is a small evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocky outcrops and forest floors, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth habit with closely spaced, lance-shaped fronds. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Polypodium abbreviatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining forest floor biodiversity.</p>
