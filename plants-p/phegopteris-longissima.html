<p>Phegopteris longissima, commonly known as the long-stemmed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizome that anchors it to the substrate and supports the growth of its intricate, branching leaves. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Phegopteris longissima plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to water quality through oxygen production.</p>
