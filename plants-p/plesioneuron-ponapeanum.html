                    <h1>Plesioneuron ponapeanum</h1>
<p>Plesioneuron ponapeanum, commonly known as the Ponapean cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the island of Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native range.</p>
