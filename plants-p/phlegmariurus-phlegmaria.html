<p>Phlegmariurus phlegmaria, commonly known as the common thyme moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, cushion-forming plant that typically grows in dry, shaded environments such as rock crevices and soil banks. The plant has a dense, mat-like structure with closely packed, acicular leaves that are usually dark green and slightly curved. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature.</p>
<p>This moss is well adapted to harsh conditions and plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat.</p>
