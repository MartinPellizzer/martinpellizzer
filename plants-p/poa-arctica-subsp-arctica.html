<p>Poa arctica subsp.</p>
<p>arctica, commonly known as Arctic grass, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in cold climates. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to nutrient-poor, often acidic soils and is commonly found in tundra and alpine environments. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in polar and high-altitude regions.</p>
