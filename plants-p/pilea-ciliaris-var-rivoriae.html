<p>Pilea ciliaris var. rivoriae, commonly known as the Water Shield, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help it to remain buoyant on water surfaces. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and has small, inconspicuous yellowish-white flowers that appear in clusters. Its roots are submerged and help in stabilizing the water body while also providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
