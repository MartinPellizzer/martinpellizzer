<p>Polystichum acrostichoides, commonly known as the Atlantic shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, with a dark green color and a slightly glossy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction.</p>
