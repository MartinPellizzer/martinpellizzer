<p>Peperomia leridana, commonly known as the velvet peperomia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features dense, velvety foliage with a rich green color and slightly textured leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Peperomia leridana is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
