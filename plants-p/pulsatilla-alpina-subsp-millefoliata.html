<p>Pulsatilla alpina subsp.</p>
<p>millefoliata, commonly known as the Alpine Pasqueflower, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial with a short, stout stem that bears a single, showy, pinkish-purple flower.</p>
<p>The plant has palmately divided, fern-like leaves that are finely toothed and covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky soils at high elevations, typically in temperate to cold climates.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully unfurl, adding a striking touch to mountain landscapes.</p>
