                    <h1>Pleuroplitis quartiniana var. caespitosa</h1>
<p>Pleuroplitis quartiniana var. caespitosa, commonly known as the coastal dune spurge, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that forms dense clumps, which help stabilize sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves are adapted to store water, enabling it to thrive in arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to prevent soil erosion.</p>
