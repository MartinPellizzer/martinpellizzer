The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in temperate regions with cool climates. Its flowers are inconspicuous, with a simple structure that facilitates wind pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
