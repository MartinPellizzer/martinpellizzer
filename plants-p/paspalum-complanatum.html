<p>Paspalum complanatum, commonly known as flat paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Flat paspalum is often used in erosion control and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
