                    <h1>Pinus pinsapo f. glauca</h1>
<p>Pinus pinsapo f. glauca, commonly known as the blue Atlas cedar, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Atlas cedar native to the mountainous regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its unique bluish-gray foliage, which gives it its common name and sets it apart from other pine species. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, thriving in the harsh conditions of its native habitat. The cones are small and often remain attached to the branches for a long time, contributing to its ecological role in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
