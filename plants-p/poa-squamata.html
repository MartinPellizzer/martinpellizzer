                    <h1>Poa squamata</h1>
<p>Poa squamata, commonly known as the scaly bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streams.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in horticulture for erosion control and as a groundcover.</p>
