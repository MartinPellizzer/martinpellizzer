                    <h1>Paeonia parnassica</h1>
<p>Paeonia parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassian peony, is a rare and striking perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinctive red or purple hue at the base. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are sturdy and often bear a fuzzy coating.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Paeonia parnassica is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
