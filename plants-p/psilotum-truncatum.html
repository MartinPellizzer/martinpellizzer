                    <h1>Psilotum truncatum</h1>
<p>Psilotum truncatum, commonly known as the common spike moss, is a small, primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, branching stems that are often covered in tiny, leaf-like structures called sporophylls. The plant lacks true leaves, roots, and flowers, and instead produces spores in clusters at the tips of its stems. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Psilotum truncatum is considered a relic of ancient plant evolution, showcasing features similar to early land plants.</p>
