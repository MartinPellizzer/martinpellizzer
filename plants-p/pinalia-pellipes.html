<p>Pinalia pellipes, commonly known as the slender piny pine, is a rare evergreen conifer native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and needle-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, temperate climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pinalia pellipes is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
