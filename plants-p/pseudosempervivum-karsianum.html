                    <h1>Pseudosempervivum karsianum</h1>
<p>Pseudosempervivum karsianum, commonly known as the Karsianum stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for xeriscaping and container gardening.</p>
