<p>Pseudodissochaeta roseus, commonly known as the pink sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with lance-shaped leaves and a preference for well-drained, sandy soils.
