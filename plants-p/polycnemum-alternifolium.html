<p>Polycnemum alternifolium, commonly known as the alternate-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate arrangement of feather-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the sediment and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters.</p>
