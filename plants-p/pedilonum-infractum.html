<p>Pedilonum infractum, commonly known as the broken foot fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity to flourish. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pedilonum infractum is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
