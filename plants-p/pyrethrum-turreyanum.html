<p>Pyrethrum turreyanum, commonly known as the African pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers and dark green, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flower heads that contain numerous tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes. These trichomes are the source of natural pyrethrins, which are potent insecticides.</p>
<p>Pyrethrum turreyanum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the extraction of its insecticidal compounds.</p>
