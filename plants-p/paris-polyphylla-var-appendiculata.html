                    <h1>Paris polyphylla var. appendiculata</h1>
<p>Paris polyphylla var. appendiculata, commonly known as the Himalayan ginger or the ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parisaceae and is characterized by its unique, clustered rhizomes and delicate, pale green to white flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments, typically growing in rocky soils at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Its botanical features include small, lance-shaped leaves and a lack of true stems, making it distinct from typical ginger species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
