<p>Polylepis hypoleuca, commonly known as the white polylepis, is a small evergreen tree native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and smooth, grayish-white bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, winged fruits. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often in cloud forests, and is adapted to cold, humid climates.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
