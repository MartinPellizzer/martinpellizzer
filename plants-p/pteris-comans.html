                    <h1>Pteris comans</h1>
<p>Pteris comans, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The fronds are typically divided into segments that form a dense, overlapping pattern, giving the plant a lush appearance. Pteris comans thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
