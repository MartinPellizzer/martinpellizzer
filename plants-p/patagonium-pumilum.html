                    <h1>Patagonium pumilum</h1>
<p>Patagonium pumilum, commonly known as the Patagonian dwarf cactus, is a low-growing succulent native to the arid regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with small, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in early spring, and are relatively small but striking in appearance. The plant has a shallow root system that helps it absorb moisture from the soil efficiently.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to the extreme climate of Patagonia, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils.</p>
