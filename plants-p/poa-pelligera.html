                    <h1>Poa pelligera</h1>
<p>Poa pelligera, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes where conditions are harsh. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically blue-green in color. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry climates.</p>
<p>Poa pelligera plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna.</p>
