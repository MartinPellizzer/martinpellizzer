<p>Polyporandra hansemannii, commonly known as the Hansemann's polypore, is a rare and little-known fungal species belonging to the family Polyporaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, bracket-shaped fruiting body and a pale yellow to brownish coloration. This fungus typically grows on dead and decaying wood, often in humid forest environments. Its spore-bearing surface is smooth and lacks a distinct cap or stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is of interest to mycologists and conservationists.</p>
