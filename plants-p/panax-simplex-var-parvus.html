                    <h1>Panax simplex var. parvus</h1>
<p>Panax simplex var. parvus, commonly known as the small-leaf ginseng, is a rare variant of the ginseng genus native to specific regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smaller, more delicate leaves compared to other ginseng species, and its compact growth habit. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist forest environments, where it forms a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Its roots, similar to other ginsengs, are valued for their medicinal properties, though its rarity makes it less commonly cultivated.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Panax simplex var. parvus is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
