<p>Peperomia recurvata var. minor, commonly known as the miniature peperomia or dwarf peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a velvety texture. The plant produces tiny, clustered white flowers that are not particularly showy but add a subtle ornamental touch. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and container planting.</p>
