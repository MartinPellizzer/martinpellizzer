<p>Persicaria thunbergii, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, bamboo-like stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its broad, heart-shaped leaves are often covered in a fine, powdery coating.</p>
<p>While it is ornamental in gardens, it is also considered an invasive species in many regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly.</p>
