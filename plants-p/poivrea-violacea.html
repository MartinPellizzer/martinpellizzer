                    <h1>Poivrea violacea</h1>
<p>Poivrea violacea, commonly known as the purple honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces fragrant, violet to purple flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its showy, seasonal blooms.</p>
