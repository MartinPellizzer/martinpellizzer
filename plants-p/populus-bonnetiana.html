                    <h1>Populus bonnetiana</h1>
<p>Populus bonnetiana, commonly known as the Bonnet's poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and elongated, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks.</p>
<p>Populus bonnetiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing streamside ecosystems.</p>
