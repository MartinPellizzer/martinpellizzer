<p>Pleurothallis bupleurifolia, commonly known as the bupleurifoliate pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers and elongated, strap-like leaves. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is a rare and less commonly cultivated orchid in horticulture.</p>
