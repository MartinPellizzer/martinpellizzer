                    <h1>Pilosocereus glaucochrous</h1>
<p>Pilosocereus glaucochrous, commonly known as the blue-hair cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its dense, blue-gray spines and a cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or white, bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and adaptations make it well-suited for desert ecosystems.</p>
