                    <h1>Potentilla nivea var. dissecta</h1>
<p>Potentilla nivea var. dissecta, commonly known as the white cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely dissected, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
