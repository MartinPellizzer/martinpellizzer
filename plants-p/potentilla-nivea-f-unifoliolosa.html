                    <h1>Potentilla nivea f. unifoliolosa</h1>
<p>Potentilla nivea f. unifoliolosa, commonly known as the snow potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features small, white flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat. The plant has simple, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine white pubescence, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions.</p>
