<p>Pediocactus cloverae, commonly known as the Clover's prickly pear, is a cactus native to the Sonoran Desert of the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, thick stems that are often covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its arid environment. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Pediocactus cloverae plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife.</p>
