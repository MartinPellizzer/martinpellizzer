                    <h1>Pedicellaria pentaphylla var. hirsutissima</h1>
<p>Pedicellaria pentaphylla var. hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy pedicellaria, is a variant of the pedicellaria found in certain species of sea urchins.</p>
<p>It is a small, calcareous structure that serves as a defensive mechanism, often found on the surface of the urchin's body. The plant's name refers to its distinctive five-lobed structure, which is characteristic of the pedicellaria family. This variant is notable for its dense, hairy covering, which gives it a unique texture and appearance.</p>
<p>It plays a role in protecting the urchin from predators by releasing toxic secretions when disturbed.</p>
