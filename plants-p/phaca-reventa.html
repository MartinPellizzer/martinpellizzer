                    <h1>Phaca reventa</h1>
<p>Phaca reventa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly waxy texture. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits containing hard, dark seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Phaca reventa is now considered an endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>
