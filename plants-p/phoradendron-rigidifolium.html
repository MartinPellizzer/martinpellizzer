                    <h1>Phoradendron rigidifolium</h1>
<p>Phoradendron rigidifolium, commonly known as the rigid-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery, evergreen leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along its stems. The plant produces white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its roots form haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the structure of forest canopies.</p>
