<p>Poa tristis subsp.</p>
<p>bryophila, commonly known as the mossy bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and dense, cushion-like growth habit, which often resembles moss.</p>
<p>This subspecies typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures include spikelets with small, two-lobed florets, typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to form dense mats makes it an important component of certain ecological systems.</p>
