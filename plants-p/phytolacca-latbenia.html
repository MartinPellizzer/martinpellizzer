<p>Phytolacca latbenia, commonly known as the Chinese pokeweed, is a herbaceous plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils in woodland areas.</p>
<p>However, it is toxic to humans and animals, particularly due to the presence of latex and alkaloids in its tissues.</p>
