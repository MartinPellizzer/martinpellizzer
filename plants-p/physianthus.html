                    <h1>Physianthus</h1>
<p>Physianthus, commonly known as the "ghost flower," is a unique genus of flowering plants native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, often bioluminescent-like flowers that emit a faint glow in the dark. The plant's botanical features include thick, waxy leaves and a short, sturdy stem that supports its unusual floral display. Physianthus species are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Due to their rarity and delicate nature, they are highly sought after in botanical collections and conservation efforts.</p>
