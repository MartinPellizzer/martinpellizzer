                    <h1>Pedilochilus psychrophilus</h1>
<p>Pedilochilus psychrophilus, commonly known as the cold-loving orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant has fleshy, dark green leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh habitat. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically white or pale yellow, with intricate, spurred petals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
