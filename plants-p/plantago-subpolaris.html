                    <h1>Plantago subpolaris</h1>
<p>Plantago subpolaris, commonly known as the Antarctic plantain, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the high Arctic and Antarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme cold and strong winds. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and on gravelly slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in polar ecosystems by providing food for local fauna.</p>
