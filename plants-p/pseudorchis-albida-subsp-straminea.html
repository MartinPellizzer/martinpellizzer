<p>Pseudorchis albida subsp.</p>
<p>straminea, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant is epiphytic in its early growth stages but becomes terrestrial as it matures. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and requires a humid environment for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is often found in specific microhabitats and is considered a rare species in many regions.</p>
