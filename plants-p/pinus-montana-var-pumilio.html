                    <h1>Pinus montana var. pumilio</h1>
<p>Pinus montana var. pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a variant of the mountain pine native to the high altitudes of the Pyrenees and southern Alps.</p>
<p>It is a small, shrub-like conifer with a compact growth habit, typically reaching heights of only 1 to 2 meters. The tree has needle-like leaves that are short and often twisted, and it produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It thrives in harsh, rocky environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in alpine regions.</p>
