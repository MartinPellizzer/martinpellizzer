                    <h1>Polypodium granulosum</h1>
<p>Polypodium granulosum, commonly known as the granular polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into small, toothed segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Polypodium granulosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
