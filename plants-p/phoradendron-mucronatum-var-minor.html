<p>Phoradendron mucronatum var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests species of the genus *Pseudopanax* in New Zealand.</p>
<p>It grows as a hemiparasite, deriving some of its nutrients from the host plant while also performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are typically scale-like and covered in fine hairs, and it has a distinctive, branched stem structure.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, influencing the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
