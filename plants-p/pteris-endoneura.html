                    <h1>Pteris endoneura</h1>
<p>Pteris endoneura, commonly known as the mountain brake fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it to substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are released from small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds.</p>
