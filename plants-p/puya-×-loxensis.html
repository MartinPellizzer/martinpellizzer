The plant features dense, fleshy leaves that form a rosette, often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant, though it requires specific conditions to thrive.</p>
