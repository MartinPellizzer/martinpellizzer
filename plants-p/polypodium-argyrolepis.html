<p>Polypodium argyrolepis, commonly known as the silver-veined shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces a dense network of roots that help anchor it to substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in certain conditions, a unique trait that aids in its survival by deterring herbivores.</p>
