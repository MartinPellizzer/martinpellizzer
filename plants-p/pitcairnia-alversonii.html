<p>Pitcairnia alversonii, commonly known as the Alverson's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's hydration. The plant produces striking violet or purple flower bracts that are often mistaken for flowers themselves. It thrives in high humidity and partial shade, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
