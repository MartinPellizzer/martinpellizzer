<p>Phacelia calthifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring. It is often found in dry slopes, gravelly soils, and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Phacelia calthifolia is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to attract pollinators and stabilize soil.</p>
