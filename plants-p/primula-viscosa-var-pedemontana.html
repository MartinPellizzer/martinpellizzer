                    <h1>Primula viscosa var. pedemontana</h1>
<p>Primula viscosa var. pedemontana, commonly known as the Alpine primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountain slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in gardens with high-altitude conditions.</p>
