                    <h1>Phoradendron storkii</h1>
<p>Phoradendron storkii, commonly known as the stork's bill, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Lythraceae.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the roots of other plants, drawing water and nutrients from its host, which can weaken or even kill the host plant. The plant is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in wetland and swampy areas. It has small, opposite, ovate leaves and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
