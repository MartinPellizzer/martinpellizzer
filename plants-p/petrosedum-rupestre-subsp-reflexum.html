<p>Petrosedum rupestre subsp.</p>
<p>reflexum, commonly known as the reflexed stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky habitats in the Mediterranean region. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>

<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping.</p>
