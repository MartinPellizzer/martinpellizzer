                    <h1>Panicum parvispiculum</h1>
<p>Panicum parvispiculum, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a small annual grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of less than 10 inches and features dense, compact clusters of tiny spikelets. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green to brownish flowers in late summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its low profile and rapid growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
