<p>Pleurothallis lithophila, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rock surfaces rather than in soil. The plant typically has a short, compact stem with a few leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and yellow. It prefers cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
