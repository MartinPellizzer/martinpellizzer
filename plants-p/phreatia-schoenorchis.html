<p>Phreatia schoenorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high moisture levels, often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
