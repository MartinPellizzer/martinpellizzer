                    <h1>Pteris hivaoaensis</h1>
<p>Pteris hivaoaensis, commonly known as the Hivaoa water fern, is a rare fern species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are covered in small, specialized structures called sori.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pteris hivaoaensis is considered a unique example of botanical diversity in the region.</p>
