                    <h1>Plumatichilos serotinus</h1>
<p>Plumatichilos serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the high alpine regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom late in the growing season, typically from September to November. Its growth habit forms a compact cushion, which helps protect it from wind and frost.</p>
<p>Plumatichilos serotinus is a hardy species often found in rocky, gravelly soils at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
