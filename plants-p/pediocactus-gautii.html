<p>Pediocactus gautii, commonly known as the Gautier's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, thick stems that are covered in spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in desert gardens and collections.</p>
