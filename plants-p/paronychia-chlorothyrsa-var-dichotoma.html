                    <h1>Paronychia chlorothyrsa var. dichotoma</h1>
<p>Paronychia chlorothyrsa var. dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous sandmat, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring or early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its dichotomous branching pattern, where each stem splits into two equal parts, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
