                    <h1>Pseudodigera</h1>
<p>Pseudodigera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its rarity and specialized adaptations to its ecological niche.</p>
