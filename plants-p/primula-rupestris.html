                    <h1>Primula rupestris</h1>
<p>Primula rupestris, commonly known as the rock primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Primula rupestris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments.</p>
