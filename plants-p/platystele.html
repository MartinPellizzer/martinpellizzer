                    <h1>Platystele</h1>
<p>Platystele, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a genus of epiphytic plants belonging to the family Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their lack of leaves and their ability to absorb moisture and nutrients through their roots. Platystele species typically grow on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. They produce small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together.</p>
<p>Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, many Platystele species are considered endangered.</p>
