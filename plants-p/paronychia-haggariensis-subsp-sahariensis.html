<p>Paronychia haggariensis subsp.</p>
<p>sahariensis, commonly known as the Saharan sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It features small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
