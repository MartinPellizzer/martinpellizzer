<p>Pyrus tardiflora, commonly known as the late-flowering pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom late in the spring, typically after most other pear species. Its fruit is a small, yellowish pear that ripens in late summer and is edible but not commonly cultivated for commercial use.</p>
<p>Pyrus tardiflora is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and inland environments.</p>
