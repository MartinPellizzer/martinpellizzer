                    <h1>Porpax jerdoniana</h1>
<p>Porpax jerdoniana, commonly known as the Jerdon's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, showy flower with a distinctive greenish-yellow hue. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. It is classified as an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in the ground.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Porpax jerdoniana is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
