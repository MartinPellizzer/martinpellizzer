                    <h1>Poa arctica var. grayana</h1>
<p>Poa arctica var. grayana, commonly known as Arctic gray hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic fauna.</p>
