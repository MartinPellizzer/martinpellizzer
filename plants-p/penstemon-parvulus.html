                    <h1>Penstemon parvulus</h1>
<p>Penstemon parvulus, commonly known as the small beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches a height of only a few inches, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Penstemon parvulus is also valued for its ability to bloom early in the spring, adding color to gardens when few other plants are in flower.</p>
