<p>Panicum afrum, commonly known as African millet, is a hardy annual grass native to Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient crop for regions with limited rainfall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, which are harvested for food and animal feed. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil structure.</p>
<p>Panicum afrum is also valued for its potential in sustainable agriculture due to its low water requirements and adaptability to poor soil conditions.</p>
