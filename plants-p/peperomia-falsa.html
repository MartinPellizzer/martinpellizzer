<p>Peperomia falsa, commonly known as the false pepper plant, is a member of the Piperaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, followed by red, berry-like fruits.
