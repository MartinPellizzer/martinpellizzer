                    <h1>Phoradendron schultesii</h1>
<p>Phoradendron schultesii, commonly known as the Schultesi's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host trees for water and nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and gelatinous, sticky berries. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with various host species, primarily in the rainforest ecosystems of Central and South America. Its small, white flowers are typically pollinated by insects, and its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the berries.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and ecological significance, it plays a role in forest biodiversity and nutrient cycling.</p>
