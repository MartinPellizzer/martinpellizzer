                    <h1>Platantheroides lucida</h1>
<p>Platantheroides lucida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It possesses delicate, pale green to white flowers that lack petals, instead featuring intricate, hood-like structures called resupinate flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in pine forests. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as an endangered species in many regions.</p>
