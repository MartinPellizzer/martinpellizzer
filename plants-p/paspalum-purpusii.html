                    <h1>Paspalum purpusii</h1>
<p>Paspalum purpusii, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of southeastern North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments and along the edges of salt marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It is well adapted to saline and wind-prone conditions, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion contributes to its ecological significance in coastal habitats.</p>
