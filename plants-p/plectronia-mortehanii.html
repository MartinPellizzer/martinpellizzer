                    <h1>Plectronia mortehanii</h1>
<p>Plectronia mortehanii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves and its unique, pendulous flowers that resemble ghostly shapes. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they bloom in a single cluster at the tip of the stem.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, Plectronia mortehanii is considered endangered and is often protected in its native regions.</p>
