<p>Polypodium pterioides, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizome is often covered in a dense, fibrous layer that helps anchor it to its substrate.</p>
