<p>Polypodium vulgare subsp.</p>
<p>vulgare, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a perennial fern native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>The plant features fronds that are pinnate, with a distinctive holly-like appearance due to its serrated leaflets. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings.</p>
