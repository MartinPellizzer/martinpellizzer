                    <h1>Potentilla grandiflora var. villosa</h1>
<p>Potentilla grandiflora var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy potentilla, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It features wiry, somewhat hairy stems that give it its varietal name, and its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape with a rough, pubescent texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and ornamental choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it a popular plant among horticulturists and gardeners.</p>
