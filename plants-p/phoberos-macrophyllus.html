                    <h1>Phoberos macrophyllus</h1>
<p>Phoberos macrophyllus, commonly known as the giant fern, is a striking member of the Davalliaceae family, characterized by its large, leathery fronds.</p>
<p>Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds can grow up to several meters in length, featuring a distinctive bipinnate structure with elongated pinnae. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are arranged in clusters along the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
