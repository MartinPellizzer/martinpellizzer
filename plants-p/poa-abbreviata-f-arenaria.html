                    <h1>Poa abbreviata f. arenaria</h1>
<p>Poa abbreviata f. arenaria, commonly known as the sand bentgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass with narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in dunes and other dry, open habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
