                    <h1>Pseudanamomis gibberosa</h1>
<p>Pseudanamomis gibberosa, commonly known as the gibberous moss, is a rare and specialized moss species found in specific microhabitats.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often on rock surfaces or in crevices where humidity remains consistently high. The plant exhibits a dense, cushion-like growth form, with tightly packed, short, greenish-gray shoots. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental stability.</p>
