                    <h1>Pochota mawarinumae</h1>
<p>Pochota mawarinumae, commonly known as the Mawari Pochota, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its mountainous habitat. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, it is considered vulnerable to extinction.</p>
