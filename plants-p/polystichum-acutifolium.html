                    <h1>Polystichum acutifolium</h1>
<p>Polystichum acutifolium, commonly known as the sharp-leaf wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, sharply toothed segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
