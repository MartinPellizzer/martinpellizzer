<p>Polypodium nesioticum, commonly known as the neotropical shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair. The plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture for sustenance. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
