                    <h1>Potentilla varia var. canescens</h1>
<p>Potentilla varia var. canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and drought tolerance.</p>
