                    <h1>Phoradendron agostinorum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron agostinorum, commonly known as the Agostin's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host trees for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaraceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds, facilitating its spread to new host trees. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in the canopy of broadleaf forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological interactions within its native habitat.</p>
