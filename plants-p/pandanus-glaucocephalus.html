<p>Pandanus glaucocephalus, commonly known as the silver-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, silvery coating. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear fragrant, yellowish flowers, which are followed by three-lobed, fibrous fruits. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and thatching, while the plant itself is adapted to coastal and saline environments.</p>
<p>Pandanus glaucocephalus plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
