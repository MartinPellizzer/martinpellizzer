                            <h1>Prostanthera Microphylla</h1>
<p>Prostanthera microphylla is a small, aromatic shrub native to the wetter regions of southeastern Australia. It is known for its fragrant, small, oval-shaped leaves that emit a strong mint-like scent. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforest or understorey environments. Its delicate white or pale purple flowers appear in clusters during spring and summer. Despite its modest size, Prostanthera microphylla plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties.</p>
