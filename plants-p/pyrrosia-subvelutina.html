<p>Pyrrosia subvelutina, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant typically grows on shaded, moist rock surfaces or in forest understories, thriving in humid environments. Its rhizomes are relatively short, and the fronds are usually pinnately divided with a lanceolate shape.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
