                    <h1>Paraprasophyllum stygium</h1>
<p>Paraprasophyllum stygium, commonly known as the St. Helena ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale, translucent petals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a very limited distribution, with only a few known populations, making it critically endangered.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
