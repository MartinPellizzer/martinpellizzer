<p>Pyrus pyraster var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the British Isles.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence on the shoots and young leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a bluish-green underside. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries in the autumn.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats.</p>
