                    <h1>Prasophyllum spicatum</h1>
<p>Prasophyllum spicatum, commonly known as the spear leek orchid, is an endemic plant species found in the alpine regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a tall, spicate inflorescence bearing numerous small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Prasophyllum spicatum is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions.</p>
