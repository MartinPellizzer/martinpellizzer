                    <h1>Pandaca cuneata var. exserta</h1>
<p>Pandaca cuneata var. exserta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandaca, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and requires high humidity and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
