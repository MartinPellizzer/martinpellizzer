<p>Phegopteris gracilis var. guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupine water fern, is a variant of the slender water fern.</p>
<p>It is a delicate, aquatic fern characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments, often found in ponds and slow-moving streams. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to varying water conditions and its role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
