                    <h1>Platanthera lalashaniana</h1>
<p>Platanthera lalashaniana, commonly known as the Lalashan orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on atmospheric moisture and debris. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high levels of shade, often found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
