<p>Pachygone hullsii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, translucent, waxy leaves that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant lacks traditional roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its green, fleshy stems. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a unique, intricate structure that facilitates pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
