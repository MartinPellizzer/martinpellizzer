                    <h1>Polypodium semihirsutum var. fuscosetosum</h1>
<p>Polypodium semihirsutum var. fuscosetosum, commonly known as the black hairsedge, is a fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered with fine, dark-colored hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more pronounced hairy structures compared to the typical form of Polypodium semihirsutum.</p>
