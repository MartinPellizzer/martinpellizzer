<p>Pedicularis sceptrum-carianum, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its striking red or orange tubular flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
