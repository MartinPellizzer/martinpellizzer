<p>Plantago centralis, commonly known as the common plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This species is known for its resilience and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural and urban areas.</p>
