<p>Pleocnemia fibrillifera, commonly known as the fibrous pleocnemia, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a complex thallus structure with distinct leaf-like structures called phyllidia. Its reproductive structures, known as soridia, are borne on specialized stalks called caulocarps.</p>
<p>Pleocnemia fibrillifera is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
