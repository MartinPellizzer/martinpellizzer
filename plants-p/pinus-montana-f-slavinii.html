                    <h1>Pinus montana f. slavinii</h1>
<p>Pinus montana f. slavinii, commonly known as the Slavin's mountain pine, is a rare alpine variant of the mountain pine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and short, stout needles. The plant typically grows at high elevations in mountainous regions, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its cones are small and often remain closed for years, releasing seeds during favorable weather conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to harsh alpine environments.</p>
