                    <h1>Potentilla etomentosa</h1>
<p>Potentilla etomentosa, commonly known as the woolly cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Potentilla etomentosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
