<p>Pseudocyclosorus obliquus, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a member of the water fern family, Oleandraceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. The plant is characterized by its intricate, zigzagging fronds that are divided into narrow, feather-like segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Pseudocyclosorus obliquus plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland habitat by contributing to soil stabilization and providing microhabitats for various organisms.</p>
