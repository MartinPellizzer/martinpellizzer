                    <h1>Phoradendron mirandense</h1>
<p>Phoradendron mirandense, commonly known as the Miranda's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and has a unique life cycle that involves both seed dispersal by birds and establishment on host plants. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are an important food source for certain bird species. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Phoradendron mirandense is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
