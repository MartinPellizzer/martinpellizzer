<p>Platanthera bifolia f. apetiolata, commonly known as the short-stalked lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid species characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, preferring rich, organic soils.
