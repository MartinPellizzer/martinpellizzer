                    <h1>Polystichum aculeatum var. veitchii</h1>
<p>Polystichum aculeatum var. veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous fern characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, glossy segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in clusters called sori. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its elegant, feathery foliage.</p>
