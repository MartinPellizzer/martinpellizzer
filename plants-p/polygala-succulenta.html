                    <h1>Polygala succulenta</h1>
<p>Polygala succulenta, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, often with a distinctive spurred structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
