                    <h1>Phoradendron exile</h1>
<p>Phoradendron exile, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often used in holiday traditions. Its life cycle involves birds dispersing its seeds, which then germinate on the canopy of trees.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host but also plays a role in forest ecosystems.</p>
