                    <h1>Pterygodium orobanchoides</h1>
<p>Pterygodium orobanchoides, commonly known as the African ghost orchid, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while conducting photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its delicate, orchid-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
