                    <h1>Papyrius japonica</h1>
<p>Papyrius japonica, commonly known as Japanese paper plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often used in traditional papermaking due to their fibrous texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for wetland gardens.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in certain environments.</p>
