                    <h1>Pogonia purpurata</h1>
<p>Pogonia purpurata, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flower that is typically pink or purple in color. The plant grows in moist, shaded habitats such as bogs and forests, often in nutrient-poor soils. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
