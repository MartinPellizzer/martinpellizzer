<p>Phthirusa bauhiniae, commonly known as the Bauhinia scale, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the stems and leaves of its host plants.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Phthiracaridae and is characterized by its small, shield-shaped body covered in waxy secretions. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. It reproduces by producing eggs that are laid on the host plant's surface.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host, sometimes leading to reduced growth or even plant death.</p>
