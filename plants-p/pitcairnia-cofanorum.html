                    <h1>Pitcairnia cofanorum</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia cofanorum, commonly known as the Cof√°n pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a common adaptation among bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red flowers, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in high humidity and indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
