                    <h1>Panicum mite</h1>
<p>Panicum mite, commonly known as the rice gall midge, is a small insect belonging to the family Cecidomyiidae.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in rice-growing regions and feeds on the leaves of rice plants. The larvae of this mite cause galling on the plant tissue, leading to the formation of small, swollen structures called galls. These galls provide protection for the developing larvae and can significantly impact rice yield.</p>
<p>The life cycle of the panicum mite involves several stages, including egg, larva, pupa, and adult, with the adult stage being the most damaging.</p>
