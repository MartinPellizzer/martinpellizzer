<p>Psathurochaeta, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their dense, shrub-like growth habit. They typically have small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, which helps to reduce water loss. The flowers are usually yellow or golden in color, arranged in clusters, and attract various pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>Psathurochaeta species are well adapted to dry, coastal environments and are often found in heathlands and dunes.</p>
