                    <h1>Poterium</h1>
<p>Poterium, commonly known as the "ghost plant," is a unique aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, still water environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that resemble ghostly shapes, giving it its intriguing common name. The plant lacks true roots and instead anchors itself through rhizoids, which help it absorb nutrients from the water. Poterium is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and unusual appearance make it a subject of interest in both botanical studies and ecological research.</p>
