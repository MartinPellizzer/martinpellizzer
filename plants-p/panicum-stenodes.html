<p>Panicum stenodes, commonly known as narrow-leaved panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typically green to brown in color.
