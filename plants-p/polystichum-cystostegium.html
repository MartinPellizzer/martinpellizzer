<p>Polystichum cystostegium, commonly known as the broad-leafed woodfern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, with a dark green to blackish coloration on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a thin, membranous covering.</p>
