                    <h1>Polygala vulgaris subvar. littoralis</h1>
<p>Polygala vulgaris subvar. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, often in areas subject to salt spray and strong winds. The plant features slender, erect stems with small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh coastal environment.</p>
<p>This subvariety is notable for its adaptability to extreme conditions and its role in stabilizing dune ecosystems.</p>
