                    <h1>Pentatropis pierrei</h1>
<p>Pentatropis pierrei, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada mountain mahogany, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, dry climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable component of the Sierra Nevada ecosystem.</p>
