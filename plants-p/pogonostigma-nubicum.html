                    <h1>Pogonostigma nubicum</h1>
<p>Pogonostigma nubicum, commonly known as the African beard lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Pilocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy or bearded appearance on the upper surface, which gives it its common name. The thallus is typically green to yellowish green, with a finely branched structure that allows for efficient photosynthesis. It grows on rock surfaces in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in Africa.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator of environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution.</p>
