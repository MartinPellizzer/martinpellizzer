                    <h1>Polygonum japonicum var. grandiflorum</h1>
<p>Polygonum japonicum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread rapidly and aggressively. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly rough texture and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or red. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a problematic weed in many regions outside its native range.</p>
