                    <h1>Purgosea sediflora</h1>
<p>Purgosea sediflora, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it conserve water in dry environments. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun.</p>
<p>Purgosea sediflora is considered an invasive species in many areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
