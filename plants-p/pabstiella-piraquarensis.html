<p>Pabstiella piraquarensis, commonly known as the cloud forest orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the misty highlands of the Andes.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments where it attaches itself to tree trunks and branches. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and decaying organic matter.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
