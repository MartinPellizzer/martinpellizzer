                    <h1>Polypodium curranii</h1>
<p>Polypodium curranii, commonly known as the Curran's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees and rocks in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions. The plant has a distinctive, leathery frond with a broad, shield-shaped outline, and its rhizomes are thick and creeping. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
