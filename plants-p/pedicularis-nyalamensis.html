                    <h1>Pedicularis nyalamensis</h1>
<p>Pedicularis nyalamensis, commonly known as the Nyalam lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple, adapted for pollination by insects. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments where it competes with other hardy flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
