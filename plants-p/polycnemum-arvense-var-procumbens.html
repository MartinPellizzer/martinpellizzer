                    <h1>Polycnemum arvense var. procumbens</h1>
<p>Polycnemum arvense var. procumbens, commonly known as the creeping nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its sprawling growth habit.</p>
<p>It features slender, often reddish stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and are covered in fine hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. It produces small, greenish flowers in spike-like clusters, typical of the Urticaceae family.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in disturbed soils and is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings.</p>
