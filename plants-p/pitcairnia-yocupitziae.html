                    <h1>Pitcairnia yocupitziae</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia yocupitziae, commonly known as the Yocupita pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant orange-red inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia yocupitziae is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
