                    <h1>Polypodium sarmentosum</h1>
<p>Polypodium sarmentosum, commonly known as the walking fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along tree trunks and branches. The plant produces small, clustered fronds with a distinctive, elongated shape and serrated edges. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproduction in humid environments.</p>
<p>Polypodium sarmentosum is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
