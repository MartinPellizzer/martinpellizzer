                    <h1>Polypodium subsessile var. longipinnatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium subsessile var. longipinnatum, commonly known as the long-pinnate rock fern, is a variant of the rock fern genus Polypodium.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that are pinnately divided, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. This fern typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments, often in temperate regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of sporangia on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens.</p>
