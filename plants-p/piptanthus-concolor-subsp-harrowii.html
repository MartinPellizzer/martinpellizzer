<p>Piptanthus concolor subsp.</p>
<p>harrowii, commonly known as the Harrow's leafy broom, is a shrub native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, elongated pods containing seeds. It is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaping and arid garden settings.</p>
