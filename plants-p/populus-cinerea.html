                    <h1>Populus cinerea</h1>
<p>Populus cinerea, commonly known as the gray poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, typically appearing oval to heart-shaped. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in woodland areas.</p>
