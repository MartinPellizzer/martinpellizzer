<p>Peplis portulacifolia, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Peplis portulacifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
