                    <h1>Potamogeton pusillus var. interruptus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton pusillus var. interruptus, commonly known as the interrupted pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often ribbon-like in shape. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically found in the water, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams.</p>
