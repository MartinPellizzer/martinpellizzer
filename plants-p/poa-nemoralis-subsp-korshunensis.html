<p>Poa nemoralis subsp.</p>
<p>korshunensis, commonly known as the Korshunov's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological adaptations to high-altitude environments.</p>
