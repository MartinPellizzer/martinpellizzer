<p>Papaver somniferum subsp.</p>
<p>nigrum, commonly known as black opium poppy, is a variant of the opium poppy characterized by its dark, almost black seed pods. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers, which are followed by elongated, oval-shaped seed capsules. The dark, sticky latex found in its seed pods is the source of opium, making it a plant of both agricultural and medicinal significance.</p>
<p>Due to its psychoactive properties, it is also classified as a controlled substance in many countries.</p>
