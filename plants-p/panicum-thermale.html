<p>Panicum thermale, commonly known as the thermal panicgrass, is a warm-season grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for use in ornamental landscaping and erosion control.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to withstand high temperatures, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid environments.</p>
