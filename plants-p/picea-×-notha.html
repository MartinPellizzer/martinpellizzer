                    <h1>Picea × notha</h1>
<p>Picea × notha, commonly known as the Sitka spruce × white spruce hybrid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between the Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and the white spruce (Picea glauca).</p>
<p>It is a tall, coniferous evergreen tree that typically grows in cold, temperate climates. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and are arranged spirally along the branches. It produces cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This hybrid is often found in regions where the parent species overlap geographically, such as in parts of western Canada and the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
