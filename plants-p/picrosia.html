                    <h1>Picrosia</h1>
<p>Picrosia, commonly known as the "buttercup grass," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Picrosia species are often found in moist, disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in meadows.</p>
<p>They are generally non-invasive but can be mistaken for toxic plants due to their similar appearance to true buttercups.</p>
