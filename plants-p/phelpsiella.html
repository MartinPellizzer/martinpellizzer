<p>Phelpsiella, commonly known as the small water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nympheaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in summer. Phelpsiella species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Their leaves are usually heart-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually pink or white and play a role in attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
