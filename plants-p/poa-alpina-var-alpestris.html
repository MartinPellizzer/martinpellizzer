                    <h1>Poa alpina var. alpestris</h1>
<p>Poa alpina var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows, rocky slopes, and tundra habitats. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>The inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing stems, which produce wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
