<p>Phyllorkis microtepala, commonly known as the small-leafed phyllorkis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often vibrant flowers. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair, aiding in water retention in its arid environment. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences and bloom in shades of pink and purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phyllorkis microtepala is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
