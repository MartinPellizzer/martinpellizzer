                    <h1>Phreatia</h1>
<p>Phreatia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a genus of epiphytic orchids native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique, often pale or translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. They typically grow on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Phreatia species have long, slender pseudobulbs and are known for their ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their ecological role and their striking, otherworldly appearance.</p>
