                    <h1>Paronychia curdica</h1>
<p>Paronychia curdica, commonly known as the curly sandwort, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rock crevices.</p>
<p>Paronychia curdica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils.</p>
