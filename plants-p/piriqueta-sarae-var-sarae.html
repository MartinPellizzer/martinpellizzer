                    <h1>Piriqueta sarae var. sarae</h1>
<p>Piriqueta sarae var. sarae, commonly known as the Sara's piriqueta, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the wet season, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in primary forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
