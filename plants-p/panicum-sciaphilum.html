                    <h1>Panicum sciaphilum</h1>
<p>Panicum sciaphilum, commonly known as the shade-loving panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in low-light conditions, often found in shaded forest understories or moist, shaded environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom during the wet season. It is adapted to poor soil conditions and can tolerate periodic flooding.</p>
<p>Its growth habit makes it an important component of ecological restoration projects in shaded habitats.</p>
