                    <h1>Poa colombiana</h1>
<p>Poa colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Andean regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and mountainous areas, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Poa colombiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining biodiversity in its ecosystem.</p>
