<p>Parasia debilis, commonly known as the slender parasol fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and produce a network of roots that help anchor it to its substrate.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually light green, with a soft texture and a graceful, drooping appearance.</p>
