<p>Pedicularis fedtschenkoi, commonly known as the Siberian lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky soils at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
