                    <h1>Panicum redevivum</h1>
<p>Panicum redevivum, commonly known as the resurrection grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to survive extreme drought conditions by entering a state of dormancy, where its leaves curl and appear dead. Once water becomes available, the plant rapidly revives, regaining its green color and functionality. Native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East, it thrives in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its unique resilience makes it an interesting subject for botanical research and ecological studies.</p>
