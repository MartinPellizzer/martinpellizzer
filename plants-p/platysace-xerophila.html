<p>Platysace xerophila, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its ability to thrive in poor soil and withstand drought makes it a hardy species adapted to extreme conditions.</p>
<p>Platysace xerophila is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
