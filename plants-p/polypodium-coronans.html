                    <h1>Polypodium coronans</h1>
<p>Polypodium coronans, commonly known as the crown fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like structure with tightly clustered, lance-shaped fronds that give it a crown-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches in the understory of tropical forests. Its fronds are typically dark green and can develop a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Polypodium coronans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
