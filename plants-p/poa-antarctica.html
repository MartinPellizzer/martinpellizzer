                    <h1>Poa antarctica</h1>
<p>Poa antarctica, commonly known as Antarctic hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and slender, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cold, harsh environments, including alpine and subantarctic regions.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils makes it an important component of polar and high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
