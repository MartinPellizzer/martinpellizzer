<p>Panicum cirrosum, commonly known as silky panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems and produces delicate, feathery panicles that give it a soft, flowing appearance. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and is often found in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and swampy areas. It blooms from late summer to early autumn, producing small, light green flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens.</p>
