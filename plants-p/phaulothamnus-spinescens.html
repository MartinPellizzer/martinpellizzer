                    <h1>Phaulothamnus spinescens</h1>
<p>Phaulothamnus spinescens, commonly known as the spiny dune grass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, saline soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Phaulothamnus spinescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
