<p>Plectaneia rhomboidalis, commonly known as the rhomboid leaf plectanea, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Plectranthus genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive rhomboidal-shaped leaves, which are typically opposite and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually a pale violet or blue in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers a sunny to partially shaded location.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in isolated regions of southern Africa.</p>
