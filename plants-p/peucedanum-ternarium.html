                    <h1>Peucedanum ternarium</h1>
<p>Peucedanum ternarium, commonly known as three-lobed hogweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-shaped inflorescences, typical of the carrot family. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>However, it can be toxic if ingested in large quantities, so caution is advised when handling or consuming it.</p>
