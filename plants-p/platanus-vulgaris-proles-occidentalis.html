<p>Platanus vulgaris proles occidentalis, commonly known as the western plane tree, is a species of large deciduous tree native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Platanaceae and is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that are typically 10â€“20 cm in diameter. The tree produces large, spherical clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by woody, spherical fruits that split open to release seeds. It has a shallow, spreading root system and is often found in urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compacted soils.</p>
<p>The bark is thick, ridged, and becomes deeply furrowed with age, providing a distinctive appearance.</p>
