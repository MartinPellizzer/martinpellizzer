<p>Polypodium articulatum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a creeping rhizome with erect, lance-shaped fronds that have a delicate, feathery appearance. The fronds are typically 20â€“40 cm long and have a glossy, dark green surface with a serrated margin. It thrives in shady, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant reproduces via spores, which are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
