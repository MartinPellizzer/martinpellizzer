                    <h1>Pinus roezlii</h1>
<p>Pinus roezlii, commonly known as the Zambian red pine, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the Eastern African mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The plant produces cones that are initially green but turn red as they mature, giving it its common name. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
