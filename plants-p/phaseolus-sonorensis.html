<p>Phaseolus sonorensis, commonly known as the Mexican bean or tepary bean, is a species of legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves, with small, pale green flowers that develop into cylindrical pods containing several seeds. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid environments, making it well-suited for cultivation in dry climates. Its seeds are used as a food source and are valued for their high protein content and adaptability to poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is closely related to other Phaseolus species, including common beans, and plays an important role in traditional agriculture.</p>
