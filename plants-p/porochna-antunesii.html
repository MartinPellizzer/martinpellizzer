<p>Porochna antunesii, commonly known as the Antunes' porochna, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Acanthaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tubular, violet-colored flowers. The plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Brazil, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features include a short stem and hairy foliage, which help it adapt to its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Porochna antunesii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
