<p>Phlegmariurus shingianus, commonly known as the Shingian moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a dorsiventral thallus that is green and covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It reproduces through spores, which are released from capsules that develop on the upper surface of the thallus.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes and its role in soil stabilization.</p>
