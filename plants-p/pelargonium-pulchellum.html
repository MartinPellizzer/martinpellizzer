<p>Pelargonium pulchellum, commonly known as the silver geranium, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant landscaping.</p>
