                    <h1>Paragramma</h1>
<p>Paragramma, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, feather-like fronds that often float on the water's surface or hang from submerged stems. Paragramma species typically thrive in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where they contribute to aquatic ecosystems. Their rhizomes are often anchored to substrates, allowing them to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to absorb nutrients from the water makes it an important component of wetland habitats.</p>
