                    <h1>Phegopteris stegnogramme var. meniscioides</h1>
<p>Phegopteris stegnogramme var. meniscioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a variety of the water fern genus Phegopteris.</p>
<p>It is a perennial aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the surrounding water.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its aquatic habitat.</p>
