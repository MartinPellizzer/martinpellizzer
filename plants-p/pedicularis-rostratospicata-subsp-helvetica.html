<p>Pedicularis rostratospicata subsp.</p>
<p>helvetica, commonly known as the Alpine beardlip orchid, is a rare and specialized member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Native to the alpine regions of Europe, it thrives in rocky and open habitats at high elevations. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive lip that resembles a beard.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
