                    <h1>Pseudocymbidium leforii</h1>
<p>Pseudocymbidium leforii, commonly known as the Lefor's pseudocymbidium, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil to flourish. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanical research.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
