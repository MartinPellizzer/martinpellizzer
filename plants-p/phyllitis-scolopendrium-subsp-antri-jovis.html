<p>Phyllitis scolopendrium subsp.</p>
<p>antri-jovis, commonly known as the cave fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to subterranean environments. It thrives in dark, humid caves and is adapted to low-light conditions with its highly reduced leaves.</p>
<p>The plant's fronds are typically small and clustered, forming dense mats on cave floors or rock surfaces. It relies on spores for reproduction and has a unique symbiotic relationship with certain fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
