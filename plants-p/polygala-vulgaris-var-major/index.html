                            <h1>Polygala Vulgaris Var. Major</h1>
<p>Whitlow grass, scientifically known as Polygala vulgaris var. major, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer, often found growing in sandy or gravelly soils near the sea. Despite its small stature, this plant has a long history of use in traditional medicine, particularly for treating ailments of the feet and hands. Its common name derives from its historical association with blisters and wounds, though it is not related to the actual cause of whitlow. Whitlow grass remains a symbol of coastal resilience, thriving in harsh environments while adding a touch of color to the shoreline.</p>
