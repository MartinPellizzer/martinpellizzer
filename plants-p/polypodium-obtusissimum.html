<p>Polypodium obtusissimum, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to anchor itself to tree trunks or rocks.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile leaves appearing in the second year, producing sporangia on the underside.</p>
