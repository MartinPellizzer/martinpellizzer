<p>Petroselinum sativum var. longum, commonly known as parsley, is a biennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feather-like leaves that are often used as a garnish or flavoring in various cuisines.

Parsley is rich in vitamins A and C, as well as antioxidants, making it both nutritious and beneficial for health.</p>
<p>Its aromatic qualities come from compounds like apiol and limonene, which contribute to its distinct flavor profile.</p>
