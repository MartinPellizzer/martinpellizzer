<p>Ptychoraphis, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These shrubs are characterized by their dense, compact growth habit and showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to southern Africa, Ptychoraphis species are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. They have small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss, and their flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Ptychoraphis mucronata, which is prized for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
