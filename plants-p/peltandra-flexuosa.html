                    <h1>Peltandra flexuosa</h1>
<p>Peltandra flexuosa, commonly known as the river sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Peltandra flexuosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and environmental benefits.</p>
