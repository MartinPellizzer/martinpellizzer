<p>Platylepis scripta, commonly known as the script lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, leaf-like morphology.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark, wood, and soil surfaces, forming dense, cushion-like patches. The thallus is green to yellowish-green, with a smooth, leathery texture and a finely wrinkled surface. It is characterized by its intricate, script-like patterns on the upper surface, which give it its common name.</p>
<p>This lichen is often found in humid, temperate regions and is an indicator of clean air due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
