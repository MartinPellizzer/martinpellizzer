<p>Prunus leveilleana var. spontanea, commonly known as the wild cherry or cherry tree, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to southern China.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 5â€“10 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, greyish-brown bark. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart cherries that ripen in summer. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it prefers well-drained soils in full sun.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and fruit, though it is less commonly cultivated than other cherry varieties.</p>
