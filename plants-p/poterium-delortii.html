                    <h1>Poterium delortii</h1>
<p>Poterium delortii, commonly known as the Delort's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its leafless stems and small, fleshy berries. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it produces its own sugars through photosynthesis. It is native to certain regions of Africa and is often found in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Its unique ecological role makes it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
