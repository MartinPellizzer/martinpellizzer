                    <h1>Puya medica</h1>
<p>Puya medica, commonly known as the medicinal puya, is a striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the bromeliad family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, spiky flower stalks that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, making it a visually striking species. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Puya medica is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses.</p>
