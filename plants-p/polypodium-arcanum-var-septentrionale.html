<p>Polypodium arcanum var. septentrionale, commonly known as the northern rock fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, shaded environments, often growing on cliffs or in crevices where moisture is retained. The plant features a compact, evergreen frond with a distinctive, lance-shaped appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
