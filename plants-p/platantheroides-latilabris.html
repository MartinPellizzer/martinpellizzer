                    <h1>Platantheroides latilabris</h1>
<p>Platantheroides latilabris, commonly known as the broad-lipped twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>This herbaceous plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. It features a slender, unbranched stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf. The flower is small, white or pale green, and lacks a distinct lip, which is characteristic of the twayblade genus.</p>
<p>It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake and is often found in association with specific fungal species.</p>
