                    <h1>Polystichum fimbriatum</h1>
<p>Polystichum fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a tall, upright rhizome from which feather-like fronds emerge, typically reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely toothed margins that give the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
