                    <h1>Polygonatum biflorum subvar. ellipsoidale</h1>
<p>Polygonatum biflorum subvar. ellipsoidale, commonly known as the elliptic Solomon's seal, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its smooth, cylindrical stems and lanceolate leaves.</p>
<p>It produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. The plant is native to eastern Asia and thrives in shaded, moist woodland environments. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The elliptic shape of its leaves and fruits gives it its scientific name, reflecting its distinctive morphology.</p>
