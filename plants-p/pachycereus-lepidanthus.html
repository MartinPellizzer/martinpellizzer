                    <h1>Pachycereus lepidanthus</h1>
<p>Pachycereus lepidanthus, commonly known as the Mexican giant cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces large, yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a striking addition to desert landscapes.</p>
<p>The cactus also has a unique system of spines that provide protection from herbivores and help regulate temperature.</p>
