<p>Phlomis leonurus, commonly known as the lion's tail, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features erect, branched stems that are often covered in soft, grayish-white hairs. The plant produces showy, purple or pink flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Phlomis leonurus is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
