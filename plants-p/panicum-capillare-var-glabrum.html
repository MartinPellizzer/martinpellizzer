<p>Panicum capillare var. glabrum, commonly known as silky panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs that cover the leaves and stems, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
