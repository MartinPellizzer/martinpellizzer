                    <h1>Polygonum barbatum var. stagninum</h1>
<p>Polygonum barbatum var. stagninum, commonly known as swamp knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist soils. The plant has alternate, lanceolate leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and it produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. Its flowers are typically greenish-white and lack showy petals, relying on wind for pollination.</p>
<p>This species is often found in shallow water or saturated ground, contributing to the ecological dynamics of wetland ecosystems.</p>
