<p>Pulicaria grandidentata, commonly known as the large-toothed groundsel, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
