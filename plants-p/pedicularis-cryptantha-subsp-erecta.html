<p>Pedicularis cryptantha subsp.</p>
<p>erecta, commonly known as the upright monkey orchid, is a rare and specialized member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Native to the alpine regions of Central Asia, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive spurred structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
