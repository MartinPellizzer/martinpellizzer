                    <h1>Picea excelsa f. bifida</h1>
<p>Picea excelsa f. bifida, commonly known as the bifid white spruce, is a rare variant of the white spruce tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive bifid (split) cones, which set it apart from other spruce species. The plant exhibits a conical shape with dense, dark green foliage that is often covered in a thin layer of white wax. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
