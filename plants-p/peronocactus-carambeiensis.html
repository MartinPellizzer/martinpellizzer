                <h1>Peronocactus carambeiensis</h1>
<p>Peronocactus carambeiensis, commonly known as the Carambey cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Peronocactus carambeiensis has a cylindrical stem that is typically greenish-gray in color with a rough, fissured bark.</p>
<p>It is a spineless cactus, so it does not have leaves, but it has areoles from which spines and flowers emerge. The flowers are yellow or orange, with a tubular shape and five petals, blooming in the spring and summer, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and widespread, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil.</p>
