                    <h1>Pavonia arenaria</h1>
<p>Pavonia arenaria, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Pavonia arenaria is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
