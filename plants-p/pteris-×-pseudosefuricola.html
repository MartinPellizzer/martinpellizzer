<p>Pteris × pseudosefuricola, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a fern species that exhibits characteristics of both Pteris cretica and Pteris multifida.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds with a bright green color and a serrated margin. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure includes a rhizome system that supports its growth and aids in nutrient absorption.</p>
