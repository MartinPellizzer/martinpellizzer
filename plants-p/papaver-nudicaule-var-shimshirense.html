                    <h1>Papaver nudicaule var. shimshirense</h1>
<p>Papaver nudicaule var. shimshirense, commonly known as the Shimshire poppy, is a rare and distinctive variant of the meadow poppy.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, often with a subtle red or purple hue at the base. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dark seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
