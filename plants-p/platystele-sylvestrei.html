                    <h1>Platystele sylvestrei</h1>
<p>Platystele sylvestrei, commonly known as the forest ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with small, white flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for nutrient absorption from the air and surrounding substrate. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Platystele sylvestrei is considered a conservation concern.</p>
