<p>Prismatomeris subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small annual herb with slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, with five petals arranged in a bell-shaped form.

<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
