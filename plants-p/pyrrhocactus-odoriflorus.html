<p>Pyrrhocactus odoriflorus, commonly known as the fragrant cactus, is a unique succulent native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, spiny structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of desert-adapted plants. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often emitting a sweet, aromatic scent. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Pyrrhocactus odoriflorus thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
