                    <h1>Psomiocarpa caudata</h1>
<p>Psomiocarpa caudata, commonly known as the hairy-tailed psomiocarpa, is a rare shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its fruit is a distinctive, elongated capsule that splits open to release its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
