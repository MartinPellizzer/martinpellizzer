                    <h1>Phalaris obvallata</h1>
<p>Phalaris obvallata, commonly known as the arrowhead grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as riverbanks and ditches, where it forms dense stands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an effective colonizer of disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Phalaris obvallata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various insects and birds.</p>
