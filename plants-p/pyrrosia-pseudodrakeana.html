                    <h1>Pyrrosia pseudodrakeana</h1>
<p>Pyrrosia pseudodrakeana, commonly known as the dragon's tongue fern, is a tropical epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rosette-like growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are often adorned with a waxy coating. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a characteristic feature of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts.</p>
