<p>Polyscias waialealae, commonly known as the Maui fan palm, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Hawaiian island of Maui.</p>
<p>It is a small tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within mesic forests. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets that give it a feathery appearance, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red berries. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and is protected under conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it an important part of Maui's native flora.</p>
