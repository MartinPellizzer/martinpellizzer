<p>Ptilotrichum macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its adaptations to harsh environments include drought tolerance and the ability to store water in its thickened leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Ptilotrichum macrocarpum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
