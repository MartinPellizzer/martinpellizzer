                    <h1>Pellaea nitidula</h1>
<p>Pellaea nitidula, commonly known as the smooth fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green and covered in a fine, waxy bloom. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
