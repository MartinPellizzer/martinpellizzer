<p>Plantago decumbens var. viridis, commonly known as the green prostrate plantain, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with pale green, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are borne on slender stalks rising from the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
