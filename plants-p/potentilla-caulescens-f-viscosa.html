                    <h1>Potentilla caulescens f. viscosa</h1>
<p>Potentilla caulescens f. viscosa, commonly known as sticky potentilla, is a variant of the slender cinquefoil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often in alpine or subalpine regions. Its flowers are small, yellow, and arranged in clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This form is notable for its unique viscid (sticky) features, which may aid in water retention and deter herbivores.</p>
