                    <h1>Psilotrichum ovatum</h1>
<p>Psilotrichum ovatum, commonly known as the small clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, leafless stems and small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its structure reflects ancient evolutionary traits, with no true leaves or roots.</p>
<p>Psilotrichum ovatum plays a role in ecological systems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
