                    <h1>Poa humilis</h1>
<p>Poa humilis, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, Poa humilis is a common component of many grassland ecosystems.</p>
