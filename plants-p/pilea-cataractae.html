                    <h1>Pilea cataractae</h1>
<p>Pilea cataractae, commonly known as the waterfall plant, is a strikingly unique species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, compact structure, often with a woolly texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. Its most distinctive feature is its ability to produce long, trailing stems that can cascade downward, resembling a waterfall, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Pilea cataractae is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
