<p>Pedilanthus tithymaloides subsp.</p>
<p>parasiticus, commonly known as the parasitic moonseed, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from host plants. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its yellow or orange flowers and woody stems.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, attaching itself to the roots of other vegetation. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a distinctive, often hairy texture.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can be both a valuable ecological component and a potential threat to its host species.</p>
