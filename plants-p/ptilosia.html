                    <h1>Ptilosia</h1>
<p>Ptilosia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, rich soils.</p>
<p>Ptilosia is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
