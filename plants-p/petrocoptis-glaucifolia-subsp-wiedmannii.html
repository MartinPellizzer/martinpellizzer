<p>Petrocoptis glaucifolia subsp.</p>
<p>wiedmannii, commonly known as the Wiedmann's glaucous rock-cress, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and leaves that are typically covered in a waxy, bluish coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in crevices or on slopes, adapting well to poor nutrient conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
