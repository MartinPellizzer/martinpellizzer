                    <h1>Potentilla gracilis var. blaschkeana</h1>
<p>Potentilla gracilis var. blaschkeana, commonly known as the Blaschke's cinquefoil, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, silver-white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to well-drained soils.</p>
