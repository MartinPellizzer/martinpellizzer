                    <h1>Pteris cretica var. cartilagidens</h1>
<p>Pteris cretica var. cartilagidens, commonly known as the cartilaginous sword fern, is a variant of the common sword fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are broader and more robust than those of the typical Pteris cretica. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces erect, fan-shaped fronds with a dark green, almost metallic sheen. It prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
