                    <h1>Pouteria gomphiifolia var. typica</h1>
<p>Pouteria gomphiifolia var. typica, commonly known as the Brazilian peach or cupua√ßu, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant produces a fruit that resembles a peach in appearance, with a thick, sticky outer layer and a sweet, creamy pulp inside. The fruit is rich in nutrients, including high levels of antioxidants and lipids, making it valuable both ecologically and commercially.</p>
<p>Its growth is closely tied to the humid, nutrient-rich soils of the Amazon basin, where it thrives in dense, shaded understory conditions.</p>
