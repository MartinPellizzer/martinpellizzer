<p>Polystichum bakerianum, commonly known as the Baker's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes.
