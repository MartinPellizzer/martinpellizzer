                <h1>Parathelypteris wuyishanica</h1>
<p>Parathelypteris wuyishanica, commonly known as the Wuyi Mountains shield fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the Wuyi Mountains in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
