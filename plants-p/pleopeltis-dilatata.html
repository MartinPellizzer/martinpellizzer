<p>Pleopeltis dilatata, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the pinnae.</p>
