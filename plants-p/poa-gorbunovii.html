<p>Poa gorbunovii, commonly known as Gorbunov's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Poa gorbunovii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
