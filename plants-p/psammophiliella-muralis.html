                    <h1>Psammophiliella muralis</h1>
<p>Psammophiliella muralis, commonly known as the rock-dwelling cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to extreme temperatures and low moisture conditions. The plant has a compact, globular shape with a thick, fleshy stem that stores water. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom in the summer and attract pollinators like bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping in dry climates.</p>
