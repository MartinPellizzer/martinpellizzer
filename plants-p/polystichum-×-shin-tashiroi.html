                    <h1>Polystichum × shin-tashiroi</h1>
<p>Polystichum × shin-tashiroi, commonly known as the hybrid Japanese forest fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Polystichum acutellatum and Polystichum hondoense.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, glossy fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clumps over time.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in shady garden settings.</p>
