<p>Paspalum chrysites, commonly known as golden paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, upright stems. The plant produces small, golden-yellow inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an effective colonizer of disturbed or wetland habitats.</p>
