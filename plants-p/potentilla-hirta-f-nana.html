                    <h1>Potentilla hirta f. nana</h1>
<p>Potentilla hirta f. nana, commonly known as alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, cushion-like growth habit with dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain heat and reduce water loss in harsh mountain environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and serrated, and they remain green throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes.</p>
