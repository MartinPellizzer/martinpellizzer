<p>Pilosella callimorpha subsp.</p>
<p>petrakiana, commonly known as the Balkan mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, with basal leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.</p>
