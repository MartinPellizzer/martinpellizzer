<p>Narrowleaf meadowgrass, scientifically known as Poa pratensis var. angustifolia, is a variant of the common meadowgrass species found in temperate regions. This plant is characterized by its slender leaves and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for grasslands and meadows. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in open habitats such as riverbanks and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is both a popular choice for landscaping and an important component of native ecosystems. Its presence supports a variety of wildlife, contributing to biodiversity in its native range.</p>
