                    <h1>Prosthechea serrulata</h1>
<p>Prosthechea serrulata, commonly known as the serrated orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Prosthechea serrulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
