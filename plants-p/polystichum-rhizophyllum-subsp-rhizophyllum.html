<p>Polystichum rhizophyllum subsp.</p>
<p>rhizophyllum, commonly known as the rhizophylla shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and densely packed.</p>

<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage.</p>
