<p>Ptilotus stirlingii, commonly known as the Stirling's spinifex, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its tufted, grass-like foliage and vibrant yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a striking visual contrast against the silver-green foliage.</p>
<p>Ptilotus stirlingii is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
