                    <h1>Primula sachalinensis f. albida</h1>
<p>Primula sachalinensis f. albida, commonly known as the white-flowered primrose, is a rare and striking variant of the primula genus native to the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its pale to fully white petals, which contrast with its typically pink or purple-flowered relatives. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in forested areas with partial shade. The foliage consists of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and velvety in texture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest in horticultural circles.</p>
