                    <h1>Portulaca amilis var. pilgeri</h1>
<p>Portulaca amilis var. pilgeri, commonly known as the Desert Sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a characteristic known as nyctinasty. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to quickly absorb water after rainfall.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, making it a hardy plant in harsh desert environments.</p>
