                    <h1>Populus yunnanensis var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Populus yunnanensis var. microphylla, commonly known as the Yunnan poplar with small leaves, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southwest China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, ovate leaves that are smaller than those of the typical Populus yunnanensis, often measuring up to 5 centimeters in length. The tree produces catkins as its flowers, which are typically yellowish-green and appear in the spring. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
