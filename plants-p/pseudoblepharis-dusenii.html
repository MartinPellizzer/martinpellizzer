                    <h1>Pseudoblepharis dusenii</h1>
<p>Pseudoblepharis dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's ghostplant, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant is notable for its small, white to pale green flowers that appear in clusters, adapted to the cool, moist environments of its alpine habitat. Pseudoblepharis dusenii is often found growing in rocky crevices and among mosses, where it thrives in the limited sunlight and nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
