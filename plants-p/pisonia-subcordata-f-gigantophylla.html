                    <h1>Pisonia subcordata f. gigantophylla</h1>
<p>Pisonia subcordata f. gigantophylla, commonly known as the giant-leaf pisonia, is a striking tropical shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, pink to red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>This unique botanical feature makes it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates.</p>
