                    <h1>Polygala saprophytica</h1>
<p>Polygala saprophytica, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale green to white flowers that resemble fungi, which is why it is sometimes called the "ghost flower.". The plant has a unique ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, often growing in rocky or coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specialized habitat, Polygala saprophytica is considered an endangered species.</p>
