<p>Ptarmica mongolica, commonly known as the Mongolian stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Mongolia and northern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant typically forms dense mats or cushions, which help it conserve moisture and withstand extreme temperatures. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in the summer months.</p>
<p>Ptarmica mongolica is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in mountainous or desert-like habitats.</p>
