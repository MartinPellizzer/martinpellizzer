                    <h1>Pegaeophyton scapiflorum var. pilosicalyx</h1>
<p>Pegaeophyton scapiflorum var. pilosicalyx, commonly known as the silky-stemmed clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems covered in a dense layer of silky, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, club-shaped sporangia that are clustered in whorls along the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and evolutionary significance, it is of interest to botanists studying early land plant evolution.</p>
