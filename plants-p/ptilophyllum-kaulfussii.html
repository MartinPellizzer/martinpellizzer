                    <h1>Ptilophyllum kaulfussii</h1>
<p>Ptilophyllum kaulfussii, commonly known as the Kaulfuss's star-leaf, is a rare and unusual member of the Araliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped leaves that are often lobed and have a unique texture. Native to a limited geographic region in South Africa, it thrives in specific microhabitats with high humidity and partial shade. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
