<p>Polygonum aviculare subsp.</p>
<p>buxiforme, commonly known as the boxleaf knotweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in some habitats.</p>
