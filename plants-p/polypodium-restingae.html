<p>Polypodium restingae, commonly known as the Restinga fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically leathery and strap-like in appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in coastal restinga ecosystems. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Polypodium restingae plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small fauna.</p>
