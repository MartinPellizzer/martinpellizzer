                    <h1>Polygonum herniarioides var. prostratum</h1>
<p>Polygonum herniarioides var. prostratum, commonly known as creeping knotweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant has small, opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces tiny, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit makes it a common weed in disturbed soils.</p>
