<p>Paralabatia orinocoensis, commonly known as the Orinoco paralabatia, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Orinoco River basin in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, adapted to its aquatic environment. It thrives in slow-moving waters with soft, nutrient-rich substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
