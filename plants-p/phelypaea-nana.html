                    <h1>Phelypaea nana</h1>
<p>Phelypaea nana, commonly known as the dwarf water fern, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures are borne on the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Phelypaea nana plays a role in water purification and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
