                    <h1>Pneumatopteris versteeghii</h1>
<p>Pneumatopteris versteeghii, commonly known as the Versteegh's water fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating in still freshwater habitats. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a creeping rhizome and small, bi-lobed pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance. It is adapted to low-light conditions and thrives in nutrient-rich, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
