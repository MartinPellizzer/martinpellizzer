                    <h1>Plagiogyria urbani</h1>
<p>Plagiogyria urbani, commonly known as the urban lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in urban environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae and is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish-yellow in color. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, enabling it to survive in harsh, polluted conditions. It is often found on bark, stones, and walls in cities, making it an indicator species for air quality.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high levels of pollution makes it a common sight in urban landscapes.</p>
