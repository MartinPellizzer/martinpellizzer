<p>Phreatia beiningiana, commonly known as the Beining's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pseudobulbs and long, narrow leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
