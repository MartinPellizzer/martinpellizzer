<p>Platea montana, commonly known as the mountain platea, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Platea montana is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in cool, mountainous climates.</p>
