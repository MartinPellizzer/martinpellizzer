                    <h1>Psilotrichum</h1>
<p>Psilotrichum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of vascular plants belonging to the order Micropteridales.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, scale-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus. They are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Psilotrichum species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in specific ecological niches.</p>
<p>Their ancient lineage dates back to the Paleozoic era, making them living fossils with significant evolutionary importance.</p>
