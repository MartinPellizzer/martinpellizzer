                    <h1>Paspalum distans</h1>
<p>Paspalum distans, commonly known as the spreading paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes and swamps, and is characterized by its clumping growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. It is often found in areas with high moisture levels and is adapted to tolerate flooded conditions.</p>
<p>Paspalum distans is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
