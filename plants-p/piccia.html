                    <h1>Piccia</h1>
<p>Piccia, commonly known as the common lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in a variety of environments, from moist woodlands to rocky surfaces, depending on the specific species. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the fungal and algal components. Piccia plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an indicator species for environmental health.</p>
