                    <h1>Polystichum plukenetii</h1>
<p>Polystichum plukenetii, commonly known as the Plukenet's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to two meters in height, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, forming dense colonies that thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Polystichum plukenetii is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
