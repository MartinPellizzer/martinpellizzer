<p>Polypodium biauriculatum, commonly known as the two-auricle polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, hairy scales. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or on rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
