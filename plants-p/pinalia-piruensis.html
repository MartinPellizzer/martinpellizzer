<p>Pinalia piruensis, commonly known as the Piru pinyon, is a rare and endemic species native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen tree that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces small, cone-like fruits that contain edible seeds, which are a traditional food source for local wildlife and indigenous communities. Its leaves are needle-like and evergreen, providing year-round foliage in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Pinalia piruensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
