<p>Pisum sativum var. umbellatum, commonly known as the snow pea, is a variant of the pea plant characterized by its edible pods that are typically harvested before the seeds mature.</p>
<p>The plant is a climbing legume with trifoliate leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers. Its pods are usually thin-walled and contain small, tender peas that are prized for their sweet flavor and crisp texture. This variety is often cultivated for both its pods and seeds, thriving in cool climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Fabaceae family, contributing to soil nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
