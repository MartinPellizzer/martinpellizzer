                    <h1>Poa annua var. exigua</h1>
<p>Poa annua var. exigua, commonly known as the slender annual bluegrass, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it a common weed in turfgrass settings.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is also used in some ornamental landscaping for its soft, emerald-green foliage.</p>
