<p>Panicum boscianum, commonly known as Boscian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue.

It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open fields and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate, feathery appearance and ability to provide habitat for small wildlife.</p>
