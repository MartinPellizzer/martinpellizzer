<p>Porpax moniliformis, commonly known as the chain fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that resemble a chain.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with densely packed, linear leaves that form a rosette-like structure. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The chain fern is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
