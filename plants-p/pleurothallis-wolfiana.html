<p>Pleurothallis wolfiana, commonly known as the wolf's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its humid, shaded environment. Its leaves are usually elongated and革质, providing structural support and efficient water retention.</p>
<p>Pleurothallis wolfiana is often epiphytic, growing on tree branches rather than in soil, which is a common trait among many orchid species.</p>
