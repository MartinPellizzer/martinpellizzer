<p>Polypodium arcanum var. arcanum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating, giving it a ghostly appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
