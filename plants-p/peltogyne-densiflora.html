                    <h1>Peltogyne densiflora</h1>
<p>Peltogyne densiflora, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The tree produces small, yellow flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. These seeds are processed to extract shea butter, a valuable resource used in cosmetics and food products.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in poor soil makes it an important component of agroforestry systems in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
