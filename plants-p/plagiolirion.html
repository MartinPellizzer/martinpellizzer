<p>Plagiolirion, commonly known as the bent-lip orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their unique, often fragrant flowers that feature a distinctive lip or labellum. Plagiolirion species typically grow in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Their flowers are usually small to medium in size and come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink.</p>
<p>Due to their specific habitat requirements, many species of Plagiolirion are threatened by habitat loss and are of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
