                <h1>Pouteria afzelii</h1>
<p>Pouteria afzelii, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to West Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single large seed. The fruit's outer husk is thick and fibrous, while the inner kernel is rich in oils, making it economically important for shea butter production.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and savanna woodlands.</p>
