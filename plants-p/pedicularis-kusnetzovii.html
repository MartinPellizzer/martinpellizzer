<p>Pedicularis kusnetzovii, commonly known as the Siberian lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
