<p>Promenaea, commonly known as the "walking fern," is a unique genus of ferns characterized by its creeping growth habit.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous stem that allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Promenaea species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
