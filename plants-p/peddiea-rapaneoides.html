                    <h1>Peddiea rapaneoides</h1>
<p>Peddiea rapaneoides, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhamnaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich color, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
