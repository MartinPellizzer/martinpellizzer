                    <h1>Poa cyperoides</h1>
<p>Poa cyperoides, commonly known as the meadow grass or slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which can stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Poa cyperoides is often found in disturbed sites and is valued for its ecological role in maintaining healthy ecosystems.</p>
