<p>Pterostelma, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae.</p>
<p>These succulent plants are native to Asia, particularly China, and are characterized by their fleshy, thick leaves that store water. Pterostelma species typically have small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. They are often grown as ornamental plants due to their compact size and ability to thrive in well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Many species are also valued for their medicinal properties in traditional medicine.</p>
