                    <h1>Platystele spatulata</h1>
<p>Platystele spatulata, commonly known as the spatulate platystele, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its short, rosette-like structure with broad, fleshy leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically hidden within the rosette, making them difficult to observe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
