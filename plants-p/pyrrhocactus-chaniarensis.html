                    <h1>Pyrrhocactus chaniarensis</h1>
<p>Pyrrhocactus chaniarensis, commonly known as the Chaniar√©n Cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and a dense covering of spines that provide protection from herbivores and extreme weather. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in low-nutrient, dry soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
