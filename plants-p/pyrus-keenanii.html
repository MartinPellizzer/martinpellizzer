<p>Pyrus keenanii, commonly known as the Keenan's pear, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and smooth, grey bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruit that ripens in late summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a serrated edge and a glossy green surface.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus keenanii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
