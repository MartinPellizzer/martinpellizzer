<p>Plantago major, commonly known as broadleaf plantain, is a widespread perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are wind-pollinated. Its seeds are encased in a sticky, cap-like structure that aids in dispersal by adhering to animals or clothing.</p>
<p>Plantago major is known for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional remedies for skin irritations and respiratory issues.</p>
