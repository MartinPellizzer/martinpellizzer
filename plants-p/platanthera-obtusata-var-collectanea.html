                    <h1>Platanthera obtusata var. collectanea</h1>
<p>Platanthera obtusata var. collectanea, commonly known as the clustered lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system and produces a dense cluster of small, white to pale green flowers arranged in a loose spiral. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and swamps. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and threatened species in many regions.</p>
