                    <h1>Pinus pescatorei</h1>
<p>Pinus pescatorei, commonly known as the Pescatore's pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Corsica.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles and cone-like structures. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation to its Mediterranean climate, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Its cones are typically small and woody, containing winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
