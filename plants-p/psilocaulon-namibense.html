                    <h1>Psilocaulon namibense</h1>
<p>Psilocaulon namibense, commonly known as the Namib Desert lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It thrives in the extreme arid conditions of the Namib Desert, where it forms a crust-like structure on rock surfaces. The plant's structure allows it to retain moisture and withstand intense sunlight and temperature fluctuations. It plays a crucial role in the desert ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it is considered a rare and resilient species in its native environment.</p>
