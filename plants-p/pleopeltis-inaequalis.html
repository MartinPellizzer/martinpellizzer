<p>Pleopeltis inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal lip fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are often adorned with small, rounded lobes. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its rhizomes are short and often covered with a layer of fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in lines along the veins.</p>
