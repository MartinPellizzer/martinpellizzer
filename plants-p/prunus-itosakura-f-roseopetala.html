                    <h1>Prunus itosakura f. roseopetala</h1>
<p>Prunus itosakura f. roseopetala, commonly known as the rose-pink Japanese cherry, is a decorative cultivar of the Prunus genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a striking visual appeal to gardens. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 3 to 5 meters. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated margin, turning vibrant shades of red in autumn.</p>
<p>The fruit, a small cherry-like drupe, is edible but less prominent than the ornamental value of the plant.</p>
