<p>Polypodium miser, commonly known as the slender wall fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, where it derives moisture and nutrients from the environment. The plant has slender, arching fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
