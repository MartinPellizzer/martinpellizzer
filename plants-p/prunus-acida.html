                    <h1>Prunus acida</h1>
<p>Prunus acida, commonly known as sour cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, tart red or black fruits. The plant is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges and its ability to thrive in temperate climates. The fruits are used in culinary applications, particularly in jams and desserts, due to their high acidity.</p>
<p>It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature.</p>
