<p>It is characterized by its succulent, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are erect and often branched, with a somewhat fleshy texture.</p>
<p>Peltopus ptychantyx is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats.</p>
