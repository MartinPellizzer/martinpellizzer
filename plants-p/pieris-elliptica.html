                    <h1>Pieris elliptica</h1>
<p>Pieris elliptica, commonly known as the Japanese pieris, is an evergreen shrub native to Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue-black berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and seasonal blooms, which add visual interest throughout the year.</p>
