<p>Phymatopsis rhynchophylla, commonly known as the Texas trinity or desert bell, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its robust, woody structure and ability to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant is known for its deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Phymatopsis rhynchophylla plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
