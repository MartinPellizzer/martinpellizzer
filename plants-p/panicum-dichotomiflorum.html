<p>Panicum dichotomiflorum, commonly known as the forked-flower grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white inflorescences that branch repeatedly, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and forest edges, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Panicum dichotomiflorum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native environment.</p>
