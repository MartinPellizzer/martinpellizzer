<p>Pitcairnia lymansmithiana, commonly known as the Lymansmith's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water, a common adaptation in epiphytic plants. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant, showy flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts.</p>
