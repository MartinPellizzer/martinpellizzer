<p>Polycodium lautum, commonly known as the water polycodium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground, with small, opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and have a rough texture. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, sometimes waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Polycodium lautum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
