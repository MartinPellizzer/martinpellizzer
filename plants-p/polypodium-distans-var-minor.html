                    <h1>Polypodium distans var. minor</h1>
<p>Polypodium distans var. minor, commonly known as the small wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically shorter than those of the parent species. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
