                    <h1>Physosiphon punctulatus</h1>
<p>Physosiphon punctulatus, commonly known as the dotted physosiphon, is a rare and specialized aquatic plant found in specific freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant has a unique reproductive system involving both sexual and asexual propagation, with small, inconspicuous flowers that develop underwater. Its root system is highly adapted for nutrient absorption in soft, muddy substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and habitat integrity.</p>
