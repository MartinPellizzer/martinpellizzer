<p>Pentaclethra africana, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to West and Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in panicles. The tree yields a valuable hardwood that is highly sought after for its durability and fine grain. Its seeds are encased in a thick, woody pod and are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions.</p>
