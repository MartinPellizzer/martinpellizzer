                    <h1>Pterygota thwaitesii</h1>
<p>Pterygota thwaitesii, commonly known as the Thwaites' winged fern, is a rare and delicate vascular plant belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a distinctive, lacy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pterygota thwaitesii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
