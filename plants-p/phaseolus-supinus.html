<p>Phaseolus supinus, commonly known as the creeping pole bean, is a climbing legume native to South America.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, curved pods containing edible seeds. The plant has a prostrate growth habit, often spreading along the ground rather than climbing vertically. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural systems.</p>
