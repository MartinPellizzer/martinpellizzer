                    <h1>Pyrus castribonensis</h1>
<p>Pyrus castribonensis, commonly known as the Castribonese pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Myanmar and Thailand. The plant is characterized by its deciduous foliage, with lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its flowers are white and clustered, producing a sweet, edible fruit that is similar to other pears in texture and flavor.</p>
<p>However, it is relatively rare and not widely cultivated, making it of interest to botanists and horticulturists.</p>
