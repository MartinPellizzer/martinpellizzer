                    <h1>Phoradendron semivenosum var. agostinii</h1>
<p>Phoradendron semivenosum var. agostinii, commonly known as the Mexican dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its yellowish, thread-like stems that twine around its host plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It is native to parts of Central and South America and is often found on woody plants such as trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host, making it a concern in agricultural and ecological contexts.</p>
