<p>Polycnemum arvense var. brachyphyllum, commonly known as the short-stemmed field sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides, in meadows, and near water bodies. The plant has slender, triangular stems with dense, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces dark, spherical berries that contain the seeds.</p>
