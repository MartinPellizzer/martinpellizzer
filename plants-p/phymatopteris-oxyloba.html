                <h1>Phymatopteris oxyloba</h1>
<p>Phymatopteris oxyloba, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear in dense clusters on rocky outcrops. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating a high tolerance for drought conditions. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The rock fern plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental appearance.</p>
