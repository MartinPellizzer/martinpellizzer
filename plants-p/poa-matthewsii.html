<p>Poa matthewsii, commonly known as Matthews' bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, Poa matthewsii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
