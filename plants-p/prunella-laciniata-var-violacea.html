                    <h1>Prunella laciniata var. violacea</h1>
<p>Prunella laciniata var. violacea, commonly known as purple dead-nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, often tinged with purple or violet at the base. The plant produces spikes of small, tubular, violet-blue flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its name reflects its historical use as a medicinal herb and its resemblance to the invasive common dead-nettle.</p>
