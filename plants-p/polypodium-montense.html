<p>Polypodium montense, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in mountainous areas. The plant features fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it relies on spore dispersal for propagation.</p>
<p>Polypodium montense is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats.</p>
