                    <h1>Phoradendron robustissimum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron robustissimum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has a distinctive appearance with smooth, evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are an important food source for birds that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>This species plays a significant ecological role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and supporting wildlife.</p>
