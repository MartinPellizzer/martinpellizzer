                    <h1>Pedicularis obscura</h1>
<p>Pedicularis obscura, commonly known as the dark monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. Its flowers are typically purple or reddish-brown, and it blooms in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
