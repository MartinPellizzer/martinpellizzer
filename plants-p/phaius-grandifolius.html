<p>Phaius grandifolius, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The flowers, which can be yellow, orange, or red, are pollinated by insects and birds, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
