                    <h1>Phreatia listeri</h1>
<p>Phreatia listeri, commonly known as the Lister's slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature in its pollination mechanism. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>Phreatia listeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and display.</p>
