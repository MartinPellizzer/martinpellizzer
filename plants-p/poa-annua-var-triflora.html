<p>Poa annua var. triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered annual bluegrass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm and produces small, three-flowered spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stem. It is commonly found in disturbed areas, lawns, and along roadsides due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
<p>Poa annua var. triflora is often considered a weed in agricultural and turfgrass settings due to its competitive nature.</p>
