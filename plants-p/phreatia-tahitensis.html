                    <h1>Phreatia tahitensis</h1>
<p>Phreatia tahitensis, commonly known as the Tahitian ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Society Islands of French Polynesia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, growing on trees in humid, tropical environments, and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, moist conditions and is adapted to the specific microclimate of its native habitat. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited natural propagation, Phreatia tahitensis is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
