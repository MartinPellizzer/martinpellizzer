                    <h1>Pectis diffusa</h1>
<p>Pectis diffusa, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in sandy or rocky soils. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is often considered a pioneer species in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Pectis diffusa is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities for its purported healing properties.</p>
