                    <h1>Pandacastrum saccharatum</h1>
<p>Pandacastrum saccharatum, commonly known as the sugar cane grass, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and robust growth habit. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in wetland environments and its historical significance in sugar production. Its rhizomes and stems contain high concentrations of sucrose, making it economically valuable.</p>
<p>However, it is not commonly cultivated today due to its invasive potential and the decline in traditional sugar cane farming.</p>
