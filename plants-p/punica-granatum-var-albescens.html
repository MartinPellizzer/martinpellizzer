                    <h1>Punica granatum var. albescens</h1>
<p>Punica granatum var. albescens, commonly known as the white pomegranate, is a cultivar of the pomegranate plant characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and smaller, less vibrant fruits compared to the typical red variety.</p>
<p>This variety is native to the same regions as the common pomegranate and thrives in warm, arid climates. Its flowers are often more showy than its fruit, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant produces edible seeds, though the fruit is not as large or as intensely flavored as the standard pomegranate.</p>
<p>It is valued for both its aesthetic appeal and its potential medicinal properties.</p>
