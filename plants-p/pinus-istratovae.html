<p>Pinus istratovae, commonly known as the Istratov pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The tree produces cones that are typically cylindrical and covered in short, stiff bracts. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
