<p>Picea purpurea subsp.</p>
<p>purdomii, commonly known as the purple spruce, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its distinctive purple-tinged foliage, which becomes more pronounced in cooler temperatures.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in subalpine and alpine environments. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss.</p>
