                    <h1>Pontederia cordata var. lancifolia</h1>
<p>Pontederia cordata var. lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water hyacinth, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically floating or semi-submerged, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in clusters above the water surface. It thrives in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in non-native environments.</p>
