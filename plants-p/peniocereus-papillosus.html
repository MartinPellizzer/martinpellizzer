                    <h1>Peniocereus papillosus</h1>
<p>Peniocereus papillosus, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a cacti species native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing plant with a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>The flowers typically bloom during the warmer months, adding a dramatic visual element to the desert landscape.</p>
