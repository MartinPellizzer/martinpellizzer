                    <h1>Parthenium argentatum var. deltoideum</h1>
<p>Parthenium argentatum var. deltoideum, commonly known as silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, white hairs, and its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces smooth, green, egg-shaped fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it a potential weed in agricultural areas. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its allelopathic properties, it can inhibit the growth of other plants, contributing to its competitive advantage in arid environments.</p>
