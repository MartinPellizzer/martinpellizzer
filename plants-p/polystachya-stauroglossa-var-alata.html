                    <h1>Polystachya stauroglossa var. alata</h1>
<p>Polystachya stauroglossa var. alata, commonly known as the winged orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves with a waxy, wing-like appearance on the upper surface. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with a faint fragrance. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range.</p>
