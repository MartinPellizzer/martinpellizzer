<p>Psilurus aristatus subsp.</p>
<p>erythrostachyos, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often tinged with red or brown at the base.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is wiry and produces both roots and new growth.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered in dense, stalked clusters called sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
