<p>Pteris altissima, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found in slow-moving or stagnant water. Its fronds are divided into small, finger-like segments called pinnae, which help in water absorption and gas exchange.</p>
<p>Pteris altissima plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen.</p>
