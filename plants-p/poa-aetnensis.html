                    <h1>Poa aetnensis</h1>
<p>Poa aetnensis, commonly known as the Aetna grass, is a perennial species native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>Poa aetnensis plays a role in stabilizing soil on rocky slopes and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies.</p>
