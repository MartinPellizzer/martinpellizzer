<p>Pleurothallis perijaensis, commonly known as the Perij√° orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
