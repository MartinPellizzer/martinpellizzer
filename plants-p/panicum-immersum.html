<p>Panicum immersum, commonly known as water panicgrass, is a grass species native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce delicate, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
<p>Panicum immersum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and water filtration.</p>
