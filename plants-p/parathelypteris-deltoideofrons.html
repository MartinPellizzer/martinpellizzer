                    <h1>Parathelypteris deltoideofrons</h1>
<p>Parathelypteris deltoideofrons, commonly known as the deltoid-fronded water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, deltoid-shaped fronds that are often divided into small, lanceolate segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
