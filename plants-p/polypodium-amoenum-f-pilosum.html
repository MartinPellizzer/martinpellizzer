                    <h1>Polypodium amoenum f. pilosum</h1>
<p>Polypodium amoenum f. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy rock fern, is a variant of the polypodium genus native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its densely hairy fronds, which give it a distinctive appearance and aid in moisture retention. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, making it a lithophytic species. Its fronds are usually lanceolate and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
