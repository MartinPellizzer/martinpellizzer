<p>Pogonia paranaensis, commonly known as the Parana Ghost Orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pale pink or white flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees, relying on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its habitat is highly specialized, often found in shaded, humid environments with specific soil and microclimate conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and degradation, Pogonia paranaensis is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
