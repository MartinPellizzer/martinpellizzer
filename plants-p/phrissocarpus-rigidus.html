                    <h1>Phrissocarpus rigidus</h1>
<p>Phrissocarpus rigidus, commonly known as the rigid-fruited phrissocarp, is a unique plant species characterized by its robust, woody structure and specialized reproductive features.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Phrissocarpaceae, which is relatively rare and primarily found in specific tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's most distinctive botanical feature is its rigid, elongated fruits that remain attached to the plant for an extended period, facilitating seed dispersal through wind or animal interaction. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern, optimizing light absorption in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Phrissocarpus rigidus is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
