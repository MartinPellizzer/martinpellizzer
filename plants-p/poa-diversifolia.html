<p>Poa diversifolia, commonly known as the variable bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils.

Its foliage is typically bluish-green, and it is adapted to thrive in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Poa diversifolia is often found in alpine or subalpine regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
