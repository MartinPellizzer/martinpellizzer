                    <h1>Paspalum spathaceum</h1>
<p>Paspalum spathaceum, commonly known as the slender paspalum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Paspalum spathaceum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
