<p>Platychaete velutina, commonly known as the velvet flatworm, is a species of flatworm belonging to the family Platyhelminthes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, elongated body covered in a fine, velvety layer of mucus. This organism is typically found in moist environments, such as damp soil or under leaf litter, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its diet mainly consists of other small invertebrates, which it captures using its adhesive oral structures.</p>
<p>Due to its secretive nature, it is rarely seen and plays a minor but ecologically significant role in soil ecosystems.</p>
