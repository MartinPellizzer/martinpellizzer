<p>Poa bergii var. chubutensis, commonly known as the Chubut grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Patagonian region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry culms that often form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions and low precipitation.</p>
<p>This grass plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat.</p>
