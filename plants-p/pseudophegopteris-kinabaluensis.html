                    <h1>Pseudophegopteris kinabaluensis</h1>
<p>Pseudophegopteris kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu holly fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lanceolate fronds with a serrated margin. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically growing on rocky substrates or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pseudophegopteris kinabaluensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
