                    <h1>Picea excelsa var. aurea</h1>
<p>Picea excelsa var. aurea, commonly known as the golden spruce, is a rare and striking variant of the Sitka spruce.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts vividly with its dark green needles. This unique coloration is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production. The plant is native to the Pacific Northwest of North America and thrives in moist, cool climates.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a living relic and a subject of botanical study.</p>
