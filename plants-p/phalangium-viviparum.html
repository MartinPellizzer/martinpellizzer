<p>Phalangium viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous centipede, is a species of centipede belonging to the order Scolopendridae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, segmented body covered in exoskeletal plates, and it possesses numerous pairs of jointed legs. This species is notable for its viviparous reproduction, where females give birth to live young rather than laying eggs. It is typically found in moist, humid environments such as under logs or in leaf litter.</p>
<p>The plant-like appearance of its body and its ecological role in soil aeration and pest control make it an interesting subject in botanical and ecological studies.</p>
