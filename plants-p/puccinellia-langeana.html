                    <h1>Puccinellia langeana</h1>
<p>Puccinellia langeana, commonly known as the Lange's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy plant in harsh environments. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals and insects.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
