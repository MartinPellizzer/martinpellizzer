                    <h1>Pinus uncinata var. irregularis</h1>
<p>Pinus uncinata var. irregularis, commonly known as the irregular pine, is a rare and endemic variant of the serotinous pine found primarily in the Pyrenees.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its irregular branching pattern and unique needle morphology, which sets it apart from other pine species. The plant exhibits serotiny, meaning its cones remain closed until triggered by fire or extreme heat, ensuring seed dispersal under specific environmental conditions. Its foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of its relatives.</p>
<p>This variant thrives in high-altitude, rocky habitats, showcasing remarkable adaptations to harsh mountainous environments.</p>
