                    <h1>Potarophytum</h1>
<p>Potarophytum, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular shape with short, thick stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and arranged in a radial pattern around the central stem.</p>
<p>Potarophytum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements.</p>
