<p>Polypodium pennatum, commonly known as the feather fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble feathers.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium pennatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
