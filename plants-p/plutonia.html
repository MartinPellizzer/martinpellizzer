                    <h1>Plutonia</h1>
<p>Plutonia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer under sunlight, giving it a spectral appearance. The plant produces delicate, bioluminescent blooms that emit a faint blue light at night, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its roots are highly specialized, capable of absorbing moisture from the thin, icy soil of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and fragile ecosystem, Plutonia is considered endangered and is the subject of extensive botanical research.</p>
