<p>Plananthus saururus, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces. Its fibrous stems are used by local communities for traditional crafts and textiles.</p>
<p>Plananthus saururus plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
