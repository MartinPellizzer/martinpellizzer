<p>Phegopteris atroviridis, commonly known as the black-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green with prominent, blackish veins. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Phegopteris atroviridis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
