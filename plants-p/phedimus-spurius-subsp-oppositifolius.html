<p>Phedimus spurius subsp.</p>
<p>oppositifolius, commonly known as the opposite-leaved phedimus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly substrates.</p>
<p>The leaves are opposite in arrangement, with ovate to elliptic shapes and a hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging, well-drained conditions.</p>
