                    <h1>Pinus californiana</h1>
<p>Pinus californiana, commonly known as the California madrone, is a deciduous conifer native to coastal regions of California and southern Oregon.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and bright orange to red berries that persist through winter. The plant has needle-like leaves that turn red in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>The California madrone is also notable for its ability to produce new growth from its base after fires, making it resilient in fire-prone environments.</p>
