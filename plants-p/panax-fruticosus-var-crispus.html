                    <h1>Panax fruticosus var. crispus</h1>
<p>Panax fruticosus var. crispus, commonly known as the curly ginseng, is a variant of the ginseng plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy, and curling leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and red berries, typical of the Araliaceae family. Its roots, though less commonly used than those of Panax ginseng, are valued in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its medicinal properties.</p>
