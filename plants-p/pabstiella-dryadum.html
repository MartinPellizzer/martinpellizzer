                    <h1>Pabstiella dryadum</h1>
<p>Pabstiella dryadum, commonly known as the dryad's ghost, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that resemble parchment, often tinged with a faint bluish hue. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the brief summer months, typically between November and January. Its root system is highly specialized, allowing it to absorb moisture from the thin, rocky soil in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations, Pabstiella dryadum is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of ongoing scientific study.</p>
