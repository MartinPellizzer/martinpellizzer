<p>Psilosolena umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that resemble an umbrella. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds with fine, silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Psilosolena umbellata plays a vital role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
