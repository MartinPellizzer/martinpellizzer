<p>Pleurostachys peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian sword fern, is a species of fern native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its erect, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
