                    <h1>Plantago uliginosa var. winteri</h1>
<p>Plantago uliginosa var. winteri, commonly known as the winter plantain, is a perennial herb native to wetland areas of North America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the late summer and early fall. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its earlier flowering time compared to other Plantago species, adapting to colder climates.</p>
