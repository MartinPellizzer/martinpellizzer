                    <h1>Pteris splendens var. praealta</h1>
<p>Pteris splendens var. praealta, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a strikingly large fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, glossy, dark green fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shady environments and requires consistently moist soil to flourish. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies in wetland or marshy areas.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately divided, with a distinctive, almost lacy appearance that adds ornamental value to gardens and water features.</p>
