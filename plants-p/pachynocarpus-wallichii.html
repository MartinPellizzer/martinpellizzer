                    <h1>Pachynocarpus wallichii</h1>
<p>Pachynocarpus wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan thimble cactus, is a unique succulent native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Pachynocarpus wallichii is well adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found growing in alpine meadows.</p>
