                    <h1>Phelipanche ballii</h1>
<p>Phelipanche ballii, commonly known as the Mediterranean broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with a taproot that attaches to the roots of its host. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
