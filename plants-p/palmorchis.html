                    <h1>Palmorchis</h1>
<p>Palmorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, leafless appearance and its ability to thrive without soil, relying instead on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi. The plant produces delicate, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late summer or early fall. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the air and rain, a feature typical of epiphytic plants.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining population, Palmorchis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
