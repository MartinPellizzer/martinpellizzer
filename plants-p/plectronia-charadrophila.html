                    <h1>Plectronia charadrophila</h1>
<p>Plectronia charadrophila, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to cling to tree trunks. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered in its natural range.</p>
