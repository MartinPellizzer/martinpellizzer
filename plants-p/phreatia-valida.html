                    <h1>Phreatia valida</h1>
<p>Phreatia valida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like structures and its striking, white or pale pink flowers. It lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and threats from deforestation, Phreatia valida is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
