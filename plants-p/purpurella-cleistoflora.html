<p>Purpurella cleistoflora, commonly known as the closed-flower purplebell, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Campanulaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks. Its flowers are initially closed, hence the species name "cleistoflora," and open only after pollination.</p>
<p>The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental value in botanical gardens.</p>
