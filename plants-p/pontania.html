<p>Pontania, commonly known as the "moonflower" or "night-blooming cereus," is a genus of flowering plants in the Apocynaceae family.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the Americas, particularly Central and South America, and are known for their large, showy flowers that open at night. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. Pontania species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and unique blooming habits.</p>
<p>They are succulent plants, storing water in their thick, fleshy stems and leaves to survive in arid environments.</p>
