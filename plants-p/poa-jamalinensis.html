                    <h1>Poa jamalinensis</h1>
<p>Poa jamalinensis, commonly known as the Jamalin's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, Poa jamalinensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
