                    <h1>Platystele ortiziana</h1>
<p>Platystele ortiziana, commonly known as the Ortiz's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for nutrient absorption from the air and surrounding substrate. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Platystele ortiziana is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
