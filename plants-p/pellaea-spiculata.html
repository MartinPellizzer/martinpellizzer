<p>Pellaea spiculata, commonly known as the spiny pellaea, is a perennial fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are protected by a modified leaf called an indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Pellaea spiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
