                    <h1>Pseudopogonatherum collinum</h1>
<p>Pseudopogonatherum collinum, commonly known as the hillside grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, woodland edges, and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Pseudopogonatherum collinum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
