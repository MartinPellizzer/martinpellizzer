<p>Pilosella fuscescens, commonly known as the pale leaf mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, often pale green leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground.</p>
<p>Pilosella fuscescens is an annual or biennial species, and it plays a minor role in local ecosystems as a food source for insects and small herbivores.</p>
