<p>Peddiea polyantha, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.
