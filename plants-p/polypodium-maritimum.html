<p>Polypodium maritimum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a fern native to coastal regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it adapts to salty and windy conditions. The plant features a creeping rhizome with fronds that are typically gray-green in color. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium maritimum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
