                    <h1>Panax longissimus</h1>
<p>Panax longissimus, commonly known as the long-stemmed ginseng, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Araliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender roots and dark green, lobed leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant is native to specific regions of East Asia, where it thrives in shaded, moist forest environments. Its botanical features make it distinct from more widely cultivated ginseng species like Panax ginseng.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and herbalists alike.</p>
