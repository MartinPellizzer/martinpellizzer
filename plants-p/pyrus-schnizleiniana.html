<p>Pyrus schnizleiniana, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and small, dark green leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries that are attractive to birds. It prefers well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for gardens and naturalized areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often used in landscaping for its compact size and seasonal interest.</p>
