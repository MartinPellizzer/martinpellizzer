                    <h1>Pleudia eremophila</h1>
<p>Pleudia eremophila, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Pleudia eremophila is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to survive in low-nutrient, drought-prone habitats.</p>
