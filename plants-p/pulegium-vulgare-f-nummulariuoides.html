<p>Pulegium vulgare f. nummulariuoides, commonly known as narrow-leaved pennyroyal, is a variant of the pennyroyal plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its small, rounded, aromatic leaves that emit a strong, mint-like scent. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and digestive properties.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that the plant can be toxic if ingested in large quantities.</p>
