                    <h1>Phreatia seranica</h1>
<p>Phreatia seranica, commonly known as the Seranica orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple, with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in forested areas. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in conditions with irregular rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Phreatia seranica is considered vulnerable and is often protected in conservation programs.</p>
