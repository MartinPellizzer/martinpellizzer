                    <h1>Peperomia ridleyi</h1>
<p>Peperomia ridleyi, commonly known as the ridley peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Peperomia ridleyi is well-suited to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
