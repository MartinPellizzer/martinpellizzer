                    <h1>Prolongoa</h1>
<p>Prolongoa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has compound leaves with opposite arrangement and produces small, fragrant flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Prolongoa is now considered endangered in many regions.</p>
