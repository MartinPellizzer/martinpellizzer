<p>Pleopeltis sphaerocephala, commonly known as the globe-headed pleopeltis, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and distinctive, rounded, spore-bearing structures called sori. The fronds are typically short and broad, with a leathery texture and a dark green coloration. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it a visually striking addition to botanical collections and a subject of interest in horticultural research.</p>
