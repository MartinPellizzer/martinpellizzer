                    <h1>Poa annua var. reptans</h1>
<p>Poa annua var. reptans, commonly known as the creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, golf courses, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is both a desirable turfgrass and a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
