                    <h1>Primula farinosa var. mistassinica</h1>
<p>Primula farinosa var. mistassinica, commonly known as the Mistassinica primrose, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of eastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, grayish-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
