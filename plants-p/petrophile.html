                    <h1>Petrophile</h1>
<p>Petrophile, commonly known as the "stone flower," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in arid and rocky environments, particularly in Australia, where they have adapted to harsh conditions. They are characterized by their small, clustered flowers that often have a pink or red hue. Petrophile species usually have narrow, leathery leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils makes them an important part of the ecological balance in their native habitats.</p>
