<p>Pachysandra terminalis f. variegata, commonly known as the variegated Japanese spurge, is a low-growing evergreen ground cover plant native to Japan.</p>
<p>It features dark green foliage with striking white or yellow variegation, which enhances its ornamental value in shaded garden settings. The plant has glossy, elliptical leaves that are arranged in dense clusters along its stems. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that attract birds.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in partial to full shade, it is a popular choice for woodland gardens and erosion control.</p>
