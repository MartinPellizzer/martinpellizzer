<p>Parosela loeseneriana, commonly known as the Loesener's parosela, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, thriving in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
