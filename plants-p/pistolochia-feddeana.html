                    <h1>Pistolochia feddeana</h1>
<p>Pistolochia feddeana, commonly known as the desert pisonia, is a shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically small, elliptical, and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in dry, open habitats.</p>
