                    <h1>Pterostylis pedoglossa</h1>
<p>Pterostylis pedoglossa, commonly known as the red-tongued helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid endemic to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flower with a distinctive red lip and a greenish-yellow dorsal sepal. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist understorey environments of rainforests. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, while its leaves are narrow and grass-like.</p>
<p>The orchid relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common feature among orchids.</p>
