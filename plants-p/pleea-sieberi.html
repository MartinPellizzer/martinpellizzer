<p>Pleea sieberi, commonly known as the water thyme or marsh thyme, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes and produce small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often float on the water surface, while the roots are submerged.</p>
<p>Pleea sieberi is often used in water gardens and wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
