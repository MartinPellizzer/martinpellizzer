<p>Pergularia sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese dwarf sedge, is a flowering plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or greenish in color. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wet areas.</p>
