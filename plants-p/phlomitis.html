<p>Phlomitis, commonly known as the alpine phlomis, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Lamiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia, where they thrive in rocky and alpine environments. They are characterized by their upright growth habit, hairy stems, and showy, often violet or purple flowers. Phlomitis species typically bloom in the summer months, producing clusters of small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Their hardy nature makes them popular in rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
