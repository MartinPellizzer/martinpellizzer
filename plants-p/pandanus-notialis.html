<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in branched inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize coastal soils, making it useful for erosion control.</p>
<p>The fruit, which is a fibrous husk enclosing a single seed, is dispersed by water and animals.</p>
