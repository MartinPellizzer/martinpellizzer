                    <h1>Phemeranthus mengesii</h1>
<p>Phemeranthus mengesii, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ephemeral blooming pattern, where it flowers only for a brief period, often during the night. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that emit a mild fragrance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a specific climate to complete its life cycle.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and short blooming period, it is a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
