<p>Pancratium biflorum, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the dry season. The plant has adapted to saline environments, with salt-excreting structures on its leaves to tolerate coastal conditions. Its rhizomes form dense underground networks, helping stabilize shorelines and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Pancratium biflorum plays an important ecological role in mangrove ecosystems, supporting various marine and terrestrial life forms.</p>
