<p>Picea alba f. acutissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaf white spruce, is a cultivar of the white spruce tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and finely serrated, needle-like leaves that are narrower than those of the typical white spruce. The foliage is typically a silvery-blue hue, which enhances its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for cooler climates.</p>
<p>This form is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature.</p>
