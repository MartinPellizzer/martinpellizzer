<p>Plagioscyphus unijugatus, commonly known as the single-jugate bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowers emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Plagioscyphus unijugatus is notable for its carnivorous adaptations and is often found in nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
