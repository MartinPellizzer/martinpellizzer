                    <h1>Polygonum triangulum</h1>
<p>Polygonum triangulum, commonly known as the triangular knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia and the Americas.</p>
<p>It features triangular-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purplish in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodlands.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species.</p>
