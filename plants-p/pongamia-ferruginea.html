                    <h1>Pongamia ferruginea</h1>
<p>Pongamia ferruginea, commonly known as the Indian beech or velvet bean tree, is a leguminous plant native to tropical Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Pongamia ferruginea is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and potential use in agroforestry systems.</p>
