                    <h1>Poa ligulata var. djurdjurae</h1>
<p>Poa ligulata var. djurdjurae, commonly known as the Djurdjura bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it thrive in rocky and alpine environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-ranked flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well-adapted to cold climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
