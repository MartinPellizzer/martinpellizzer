<p>Pedilonum septemcostulatum, commonly known as the seven-costed pedilonum, is a unique flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive seven prominent costae, or ribs, on its seed pods, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface depending on the variety.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its rare morphology and limited geographic distribution.</p>
