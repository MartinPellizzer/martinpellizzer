                    <h1>Phoradendron intermedium</h1>
<p>Phoradendron intermedium, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with its host, often leading to weakened growth in the host tree over time. Its berries are a food source for birds, which then disperse the seeds to new hosts.</p>
<p>The plant's unique life cycle and ecological role make it an important species in forest ecosystems.</p>
