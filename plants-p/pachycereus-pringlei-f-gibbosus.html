<p>Pachycereus pringlei f. gibbosus, commonly known as the Sonoran giant saguaro, is a columnar cactus native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and a distinctive swollen base, which can grow up to 50 feet tall. The plant has a unique growth pattern, with new stems emerging from the base as the main stem ages. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems and having spines for protection.</p>
<p>Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are typically yellow or white and attract pollinators like bats and insects.</p>
