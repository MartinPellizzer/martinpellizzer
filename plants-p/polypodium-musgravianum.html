<p>Polypodium musgravianum, commonly known as the Musgrave water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories near streams or in wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread through the soil, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates.</p>
