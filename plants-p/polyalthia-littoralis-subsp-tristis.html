<p>Polyalthia littoralis subsp.</p>
<p>tristis, commonly known as the coastal polyalthia, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often fissured bark and compound leaves with ovate to elliptic leaflets.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by woody, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy or muddy soils near the shoreline and is often found in mangrove or brackish water environments.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability to saline conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.</p>
