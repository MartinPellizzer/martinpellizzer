                    <h1>Pleurothallis apoxys</h1>
<p>Pleurothallis apoxys, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the wet season. It has thin, wiry roots that help it anchor to tree bark and absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
