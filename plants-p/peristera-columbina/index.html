                            <h1>Peristera Columbina</h1>
<p>Peristera columbina is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is known for its small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late spring. This plant thrives in rocky soils and humid climates, often found in shaded forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure its survival in the wild.</p>
