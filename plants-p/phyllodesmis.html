                    <h1>Phyllodesmis</h1>
<p>Phyllodesmis, commonly known as the leafless fig, is a unique genus of plants in the Moraceae family.</p>
<p>Despite its name, it does not have typical leaves but instead produces specialized structures called phyllodes, which function as both leaves and stems. These phyllodes are often modified to perform photosynthesis and support the plant's growth. The plant is native to parts of Africa and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Its distinctive morphology makes it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
