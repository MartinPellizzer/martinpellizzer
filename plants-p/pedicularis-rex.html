                    <h1>Pedicularis rex</h1>
<p>Pedicularis rex, commonly known as the king's crown, is a striking member of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its vivid red and orange flowers that resemble a crown. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while performing photosynthesis. Its unique floral structure includes spurred petals that attract specific pollinators, such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is considered a symbol of strength and resilience.</p>
