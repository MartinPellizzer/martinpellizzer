<p>Pinus devoniana subsp.</p>
<p>quevedoi, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone pine, is a rare and slow-growing conifer native to the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive bark, which is thick, scaly, and often reddish-brown in color.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its needle-like leaves are typically short and clustered in bundles of five.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to high-altitude environments and exhibits a unique morphology suited to its harsh, arid habitat.</p>
