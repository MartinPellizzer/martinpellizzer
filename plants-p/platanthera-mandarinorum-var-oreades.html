                    <h1>Platanthera mandarinorum var. oreades</h1>
<p>Platanthera mandarinorum var. oreades, commonly known as the alpine lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It has a delicate root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils, often forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
