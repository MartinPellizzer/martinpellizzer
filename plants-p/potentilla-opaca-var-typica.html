                    <h1>Potentilla opaca var. typica</h1>
<p>Potentilla opaca var. typica, commonly known as the rock rose, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates.</p>
