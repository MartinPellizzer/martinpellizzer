                    <h1>Pleopeltis michauxiana</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis michauxiana, commonly known as the Michaux's rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or in forest undergrowth. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>The plant's adaptability to various substrates makes it a common sight in humid tropical ecosystems.</p>
