<p>Pedicularis mussotii var. lophocentra, commonly known as the golden beard vernal, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on its host plants for nutrients. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
