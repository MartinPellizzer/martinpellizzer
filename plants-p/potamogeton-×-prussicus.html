<p>It is characterized by its long, flexible stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which are often submerged or floating at the water's surface. Potamogeton × prussicus is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in a range of water conditions makes it a common and adaptable species in shallow, still waters.</p>
