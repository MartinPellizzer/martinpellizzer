                    <h1>Phoradendron grahamii</h1>
<p>Phoradendron grahamii, commonly known as the Graham's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and gelatinous, sticky berries that contain toxic compounds. The plant lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host tree's bark. Its flowers are small, white or greenish, and it relies on specific bird species for seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain wildlife.</p>
