<p>Panicum anisostachyum, commonly known as the variable panic grass, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear a dense cluster of spikelets at the tips. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often unequal in length, giving it the specific epithet "anisostachyum.".</p>
<p>This grass is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its fine texture and drought tolerance.</p>
