<p>Paspalum brachytrichum, commonly known as smooth paspalum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and short, stiff leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to spread rapidly and form dense mats.</p>
