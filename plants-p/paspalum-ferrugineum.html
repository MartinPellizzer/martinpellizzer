<p>Paspalum ferrugineum, commonly known as red grass or iron grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and reddish-brown inflorescences, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy areas, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it produces small, spike-like flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Paspalum ferrugineum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
