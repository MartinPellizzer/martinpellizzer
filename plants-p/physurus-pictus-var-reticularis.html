                    <h1>Physurus pictus var. reticularis</h1>
<p>Physurus pictus var. reticularis, commonly known as the red-tailed tree frog, is a species of tree frog native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red tail and green body with intricate patterns. The plant in question, however, is not a plant but an animal, specifically a frog. Therefore, it does not have botanical aspects.</p>
<p>I can't reply.</p>
