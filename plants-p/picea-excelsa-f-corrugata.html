<p>Picea excelsa f. corrugata, commonly known as the wrinkled white spruce, is a rare and unique form of the white spruce species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply furrowed bark that gives it a rugged appearance. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are typically a silvery-white color, distinguishing it from other spruce varieties. This variant is found in high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
