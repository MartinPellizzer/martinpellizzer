<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to the Americas, particularly in regions of Central and South America. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that are dispersed by birds, which also feed on the fruit. Its leaves are alternate and scale-like, and it lacks true roots, relying on its host for water and nutrients.</p>
