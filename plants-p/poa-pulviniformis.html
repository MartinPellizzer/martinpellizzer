<p>Poa pulviniformis, commonly known as the cushion grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with short, upright shoots that create a cushion-like appearance. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Poa pulviniformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soils in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
