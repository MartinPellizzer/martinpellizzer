                    <h1>Potamogeton × torssanderi</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × torssanderi, commonly known as the hybrid water milfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant that belongs to the family Potamogetonaceae.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Potamogeton perfoliatus and Potamogeton praelongus, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, greenish flowers that are typically found in clusters. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it can exhibit genetic variability, which influences its morphology and ecological distribution.</p>
