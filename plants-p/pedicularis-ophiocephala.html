<p>Pedicularis ophiocephala, commonly known as the golden monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
