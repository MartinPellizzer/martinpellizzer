                    <h1>Phegopteris gymnocarpa</h1>
<p>Phegopteris gymnocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-fruit water fern, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller, serrated segments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for studying the ecology of aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
