<p>Pandanus concretus subsp.</p>
<p>circularis, commonly known as the circular pandanus, is a species native to the Pacific Islands. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its robust, fibrous trunk and dense, fan-like leaves.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically broad, curved, and have a waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in arid conditions. It produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish flowers, followed by fibrous, spiky fruits.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in traditional crafts and has cultural significance in many island communities.</p>
