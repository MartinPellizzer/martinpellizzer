                    <h1>Polypogon × subaristatus</h1>
<p>Polypogon × subaristatus, commonly known as the hybrid false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid between Polypogon monogonus and Polypogon pauciflorus, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it forms dense, clump-like growths. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is often found in areas where the parent species overlap, contributing to ecological diversity in wetland ecosystems.</p>
