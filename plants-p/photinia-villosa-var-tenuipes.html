                    <h1>Photinia villosa var. tenuipes</h1>
<p>Photinia villosa var. tenuipes, commonly known as the silverleaf photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely textured, silvery-gray foliage that provides a striking contrast to its dark red or purple new growth. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates.</p>
