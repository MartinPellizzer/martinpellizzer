                    <h1>Psilotum floridanum</h1>
<p>Psilotum floridanum, commonly known as the Florida spike moss, is a small, primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and small, leaf-like structures called sporophylls. The plant lacks true leaves, roots, and flowers, and instead produces spores on specialized structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in sandy soils along the coasts of Florida.</p>
<p>Psilotum floridanum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
