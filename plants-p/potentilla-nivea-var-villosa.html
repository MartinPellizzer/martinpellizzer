                    <h1>Potentilla nivea var. villosa</h1>
<p>Potentilla nivea var. villosa, commonly known as the white cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
