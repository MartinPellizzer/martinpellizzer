                    <h1>Puya angelensis</h1>
<p>Puya angelensis, commonly known as the Angel's Puya, is a striking member of the bromeliad family, native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears numerous bright red or orange flowers, which are clustered in a dense, showy display. The plant has strap-shaped, evergreen leaves that form a rosette, creating a striking visual contrast with its vibrant floral display. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited natural habitat, Puya angelensis is considered a rare and valuable ornamental plant in botanical collections.</p>
