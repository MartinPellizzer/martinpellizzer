<p>Pollinia ciliata subsp.</p>
<p>wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the cold and arid conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>The pollinia, which are unique to orchids, are clustered in a structure called a pollinarium, aiding in its specialized pollination mechanism.</p>
