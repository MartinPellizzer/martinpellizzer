<p>Pediocactus schmiedickeanus var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender Schmiedicke's cactus, is a compact, columnar cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, typically in clusters at the top of the stem. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and desert gardens.</p>
