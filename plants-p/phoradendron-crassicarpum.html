                    <h1>Phoradendron crassicarpum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron crassicarpum, commonly known as the thick-fruited mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and gelatinous, sticky berries that contain toxic compounds. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria that attach to the host's vascular system. Its flowers are typically small and white or greenish, and it produces clusters of fleshy, red or orange fruits.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects, despite its toxic properties.</p>
