                    <h1>Pisophaca coriacea</h1>
<p>Pisophaca coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf sandmat, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the summer months. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils and low moisture environments.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often found in disturbed areas and is used in some traditional herbal practices.</p>
