                    <h1>Pronephrium palauense</h1>
<p>Pronephrium palauense, commonly known as the Palau kidney fern, is a species of fern native to the island of Palau in the Western Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately compound fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, which help it store water in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The fronds are often used in traditional practices by the local communities of Palau.</p>
