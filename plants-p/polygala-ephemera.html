<p>Polygala ephemera, commonly known as the ephemeral milkvetch, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often going dormant during periods of drought. Its short life cycle and rapid growth pattern make it a unique member of the Polygalaceae family.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its medicinal properties, traditionally used by indigenous communities for various health-related purposes.</p>
