                    <h1>Pedilonum uliginosum</h1>
<p>Pedilonum uliginosum, commonly known as the bog lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and green algae or cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and acidic soils. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead forms a crust-like structure on its substrate. Its growth is slow, and it plays a vital role in nutrient cycling in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator of habitat quality.</p>
