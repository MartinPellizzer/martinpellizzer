<p>Pneumatopteris florencei, commonly known as the Florence water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation for small aquatic organisms.</p>
