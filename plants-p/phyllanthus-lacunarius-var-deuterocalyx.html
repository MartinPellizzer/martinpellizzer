<p>Phyllanthus lacunarius var. deuterocalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by small, spherical fruits. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive with minimal water, making it a resilient species in drought-prone areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important plant for ecological studies and potential medicinal uses.</p>
