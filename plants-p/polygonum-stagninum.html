                    <h1>Polygonum stagninum</h1>
<p>Polygonum stagninum, commonly known as water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in shallow water or moist soil.</p>
<p>Polygonum stagninum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
