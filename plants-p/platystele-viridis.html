                    <h1>Platystele viridis</h1>
<p>Platystele viridis, commonly known as the green platystele, is a rare and unique member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically green or white, and are borne in a spike.</p>
<p>Platystele viridis is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
