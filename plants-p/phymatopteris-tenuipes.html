<p>Phymatopteris tenuipes, commonly known as the slender wall fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 20 centimeters in length. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it an important component of xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
