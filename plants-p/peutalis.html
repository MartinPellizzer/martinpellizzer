<p>Peutalis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often overlooked due to its foliage. Peutalis is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
