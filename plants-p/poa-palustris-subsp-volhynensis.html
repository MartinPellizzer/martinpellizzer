<p>Poa palustris subsp.</p>
<p>volhynensis, commonly known as the Volhynian marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often hairy leaves that are adapted to waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with bisexual flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in peat bogs and other moist environments, playing a vital role in stabilizing these fragile ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
