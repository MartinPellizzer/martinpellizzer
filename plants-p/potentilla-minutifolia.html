                    <h1>Potentilla minutifolia</h1>
<p>Potentilla minutifolia, commonly known as dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter, arranged in a dense, mat-like growth pattern. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on short, hairy pedicels. Its root system is fibrous and well adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Potentilla minutifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
