                    <h1>Pinus angulata</h1>
<p>Pinus angulata, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its distinctive, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are elongated and often pendulous, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Pinus angulata thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, dry climates and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and longevity, it is considered a valuable species for ecological and scientific study.</p>
