                    <h1>Phoradendron serpyllifolium</h1>
<p>Phoradendron serpyllifolium, commonly known as the creeping mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers followed by small, round berries that are dispersed by birds. Its roots form haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in forest understories and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife.</p>
