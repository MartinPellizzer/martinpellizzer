<p>Potentilla gelida f. pilosior, commonly known as the hairy alpine cinquefoil, is a frost-tolerant shrub native to the alpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate it against extreme cold. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a distinctive five-lobed shape.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to rocky, high-altitude environments where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil.</p>
