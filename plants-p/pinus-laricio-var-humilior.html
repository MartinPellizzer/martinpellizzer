                    <h1>Pinus laricio var. humilior</h1>
<p>Pinus laricio var. humilior, commonly known as the dwarf Macedonian pine, is a rare and low-growing variant of the European stone pine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact form, with short, twisted branches and a dense, cushion-like appearance. The needles are typically shorter and more clustered than those of the standard species, contributing to its distinctive morphology. It thrives in high-altitude, rocky environments, often found in the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species with conservation concerns.</p>
