                    <h1>Pyrus cretacea</h1>
<p>Pyrus cretacea, commonly known as the Cretaceous pear, is a fossil plant species that lived during the Cretaceous period.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its woody structure and simple, alternate leaves. The plant exhibits features typical of early angiosperms, including a vascular system and reproductive structures. Fossilized remains of Pyrus cretacea provide valuable insights into the evolution of flowering plants.</p>
<p>Its morphology suggests it may have been a small tree or shrub adapted to the warm, coastal environments of the Cretaceous era.</p>
