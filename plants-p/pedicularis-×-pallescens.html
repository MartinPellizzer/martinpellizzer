                    <h1>Pedicularis × pallescens</h1>
<p>Pedicularis × pallescens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its specialized roots. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to alpine regions of Europe and is often found growing on the stems of other plants.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
