                    <h1>Pyrethrum heldreichianum</h1>
<p>Pyrethrum heldreichianum, commonly known as the Balkan pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flower heads. The plant produces tiny, thread-like hairs called trichomes, which contain pyrethrinsâ€”natural insecticides. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and historical use in pest control, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
