                    <h1>Platanthera carnosilabris</h1>
<p>Platanthera carnosilabris, commonly known as the pink marsh-orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a short, hairy stem and produces small, greenish leaves that are adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor environments. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this species is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
