                    <h1>Phycella maulensis</h1>
<p>Phycella maulensis, commonly known as the Maul's phycella, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, pentagonal flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep red. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices or on slopes. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Phycella maulensis is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
