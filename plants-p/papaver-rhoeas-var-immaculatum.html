<p>Papaver rhoeas var. immaculatum, commonly known as the white poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its pale to white flowers.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing to a height of 30â€“60 cm. The flowers are simple, with five broad petals and a prominent central stigma, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and alternate along the stem, often with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>This variety is less common than the typical red poppy and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
