                    <h1>Picea excelsa f. tubuliformis</h1>
<p>Picea excelsa f. tubuliformis, commonly known as the Alpine fir, is a rare and distinctive subspecies of the silver fir.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, cylindrical cones and upward-curving needles that give it a unique appearance. Native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau, this plant thrives in cold, mountainous environments. Its slow growth and compact form make it well adapted to harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>The subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in alpine ecosystems.</p>
