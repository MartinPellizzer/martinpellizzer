<p>Polystichum affine, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky habitats. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in distinct groups.</p>
