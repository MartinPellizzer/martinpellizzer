                    <h1>Polystichum frigidicola</h1>
<p>Polystichum frigidicola, commonly known as the cold-loving fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or shaded areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the fern family.</p>
