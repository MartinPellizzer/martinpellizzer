<p>Pteris galeottii, commonly known as the Galeotti's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Pteris galeottii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
