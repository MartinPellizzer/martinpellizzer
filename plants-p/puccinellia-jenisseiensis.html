<p>Puccinellia jenisseiensis, commonly known as the Jenisei rush, is a perennial grass species native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet, marshy habitats and is adapted to tolerate saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
