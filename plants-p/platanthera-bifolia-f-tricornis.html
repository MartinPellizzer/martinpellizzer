                    <h1>Platanthera bifolia f. tricornis</h1>
<p>Platanthera bifolia f. tricornis, commonly known as the tricorne lady's tresses, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed lip, which gives it its specific epithet "tricornis.". The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and bogs, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pale green to yellowish in color, arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered vulnerable and is often protected in conservation efforts.</p>
