                    <h1>Patropyrum tauschii</h1>
<p>Patropyrum tauschii, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect growth and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is valued for its high biomass yield and potential as a forage crop.</p>
<p>Patropyrum tauschii is also of interest in genetic research due to its role in the evolution of wheat species.</p>
