                    <h1>Papaver rhoeas f. cruciatum</h1>
<p>Papaver rhoeas f. cruciatum, commonly known as the crimson poppy, is a botanical variant of the common poppy.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red flowers with a prominent central stigma that resembles a cross, hence the name "cruciatum.". This feature is a result of natural mutations and is more pronounced in this form compared to the typical Papaver rhoeas. The plant is native to Europe and thrives in disturbed soils, often found in fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>It is an annual herb that blooms in the summer, adding a vivid splash of color to the landscape.</p>
