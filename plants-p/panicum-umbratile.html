<p>Panicum umbratile, commonly known as the shadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded environments, often found in forest understories where light is limited. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically a deep green color, adapted to maximize light absorption. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to grow in low-light conditions, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
