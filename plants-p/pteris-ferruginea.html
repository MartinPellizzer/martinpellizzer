<p>Pteris ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty brake, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a rusty-brown spore mass. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year of growth.</p>
