                    <h1>Psammisia ulbrichiana</h1>
<p>Psammisia ulbrichiana, commonly known as the sand dune aster, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, saline environments. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Psammisia ulbrichiana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
