                    <h1>Pinus laricina</h1>
<p>Pinus laricina, commonly known as the larch or tamarack, is a deciduous conifer native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden and fall off in autumn, making it unique among pines. The tree typically grows in swampy or wetland areas, adapting to poorly drained soils. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The bark is thin and scaly, becoming thicker and more fissured with age.</p>
