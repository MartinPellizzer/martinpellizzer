<p>Pectis patula, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces showy, yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is fibrous and helps it survive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Pectis patula is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
