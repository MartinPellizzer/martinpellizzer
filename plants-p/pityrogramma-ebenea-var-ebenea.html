                    <h1>Pityrogramma ebenea var. ebenea</h1>
<p>Pityrogramma ebenea var. ebenea, commonly known as the velvet shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds with a velvety texture. The fronds are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, and the plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
