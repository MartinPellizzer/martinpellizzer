<p>It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and meadows. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The species is relatively rare and is considered a conservation concern due to habitat loss and overcollection.</p>
