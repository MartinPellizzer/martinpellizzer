<p>Phegopteris pentaphylla, commonly known as the five-lobed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are divided into five lobes, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Phegopteris pentaphylla plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling.</p>
