                    <h1>Polypodium nudatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium nudatum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly glossy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizome is fibrous and often covered with a thin layer of soil, which helps anchor it in its habitat.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
