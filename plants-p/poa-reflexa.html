<p>Poa reflexa, commonly known as bentgrass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous and clustered at the base of the stems. Poa reflexa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its fine texture and ability to thrive in cool, damp conditions.</p>
