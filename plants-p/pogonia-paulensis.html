<p>Pogonia paulensis, commonly known as the Brazilian ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, often leafless stem and a single, showy flower that resembles a ghostly face. The plant produces a delicate, greenish-white bloom with a distinctive, intricate pattern of purple and green markings. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
