<p>Paspalum cartilagineum, commonly known as the cartilage grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous rhizomes and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
