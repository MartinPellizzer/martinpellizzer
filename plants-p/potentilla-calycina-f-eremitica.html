                    <h1>Potentilla calycina f. eremitica</h1>
<p>Potentilla calycina f. eremitica, commonly known as the Desert cinquefoil, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters of five. The plant has narrow, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. It is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and erosion control in harsh climates.</p>
