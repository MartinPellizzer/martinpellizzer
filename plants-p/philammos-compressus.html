                    <h1>Philammos compressus</h1>
<p>Philammos compressus, commonly known as the flat-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that are compressed and closely arranged along its stems, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its root system is shallow and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Philammos compressus is often found in disturbed areas and is considered an indicator species for dry, open habitats.</p>
