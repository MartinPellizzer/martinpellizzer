                    <h1>Piptomeris floribunda</h1>
<p>Piptomeris floribunda, commonly known as the pink-flowered water plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a waxy coating that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Piptomeris floribunda is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive floral display and ability to thrive in moist conditions.</p>
