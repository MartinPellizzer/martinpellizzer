                <h1>Pteris aquilina</h1>
<p>Pteris aquilina, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green and have a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while the spores are produced on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Pteris aquilina is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
