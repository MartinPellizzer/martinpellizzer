<p>Paronychia suffruticosa subsp.</p>
<p>suffruticosa, commonly known as the coastal beardtongue, is a shrub-like plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, woody stems and small, hairy leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing along cliffs and dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered an important component of coastal vegetation in its native habitat.</p>
