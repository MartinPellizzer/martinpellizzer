                    <h1>Papaver ochotense f. xanthopetalum</h1>
<p>Papaver ochotense f. xanthopetalum, commonly known as the yellow-petaled poppy, is a rare and striking variant of the Ochotense poppy.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow petals, which contrast sharply with its typical red or orange hues. This botanical form is native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Siberia and is often found in alpine meadows. The plant produces delicate, cup-shaped flowers and has a short growing season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
