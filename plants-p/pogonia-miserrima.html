<p>Pogonia miserrima, commonly known as the sad pale orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale pink or white flowers with intricate patterns resembling veins, and its slender, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands, often near streams or in swampy areas. It has a short flowering period in late spring to early summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Pogonia miserrima is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
