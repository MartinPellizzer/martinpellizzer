<p>Pontederia subovata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water hyacinth, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically floating or semi-submerged, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in dense, spike-like clusters above the water surface. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Pontederia subovata is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes.</p>
