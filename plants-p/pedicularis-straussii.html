                    <h1>Pedicularis straussii</h1>
<p>Pedicularis straussii, commonly known as the Strauss's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially depends on host plants for nutrients. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas of Austria, Italy, and Switzerland. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred shape that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
