                    <h1>Pteris straminea</h1>
<p>Pteris straminea, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that are covered in a fine, cinnamon-colored down on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread slowly over time.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a broad, lance-shaped appearance that adds visual interest to shaded gardens.</p>
