<p>Pseudolaelia freyi, commonly known as the Frey's orchid, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous growth habit. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pseudolaelia freyi is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
