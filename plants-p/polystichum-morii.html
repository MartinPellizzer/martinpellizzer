<p>Polystichum morii, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, upright fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form thick mats.
