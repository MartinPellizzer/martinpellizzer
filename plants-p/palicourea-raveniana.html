<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and usually glossy leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, often appearing in the axils of the leaves. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments, making it a popular choice for tropical gardens.</p>
