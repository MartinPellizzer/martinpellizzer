                    <h1>Pentelesia</h1>
<p>Pentelesia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique member of the Apocynaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its striking, pale blue or purple flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Pentelesia thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Its flowers are primarily pollinated by specific insects, contributing to its ecological significance in desert ecosystems.</p>
