                    <h1>Phoradendron helleri</h1>
<p>Phoradendron helleri, commonly known as the Heller's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds and other animals. It is native to Australia and is often found in regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various species.</p>
