                    <h1>Physalis hederifolia var. cordifolia</h1>
<p>Physalis hederifolia var. cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf winter cherry, is a variant of the winter cherry plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, orange berries that are enclosed in a papery calyx, a feature common to many species in the Physalis genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits, though the berries are typically too tart for direct consumption.</p>
