                    <h1>Phegos</h1>
<p>Phegos, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient absorption. Its unique appearance and limited habitat make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, phegos is listed as an endangered species in many regions.</p>
