<p>Pterocypsela indivisa, commonly known as the rough-hairy sunflower, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow composite flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Its fruit is a pappus-equipped achene, typical of the sunflower family, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Native to southern Africa, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
