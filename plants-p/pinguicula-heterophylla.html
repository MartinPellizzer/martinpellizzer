                    <h1>Pinguicula heterophylla</h1>
<p>Pinguicula heterophylla, commonly known as the variable bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, modified leaves that form small bladders to trap and digest insects. The plant exhibits morphological variation depending on its habitat, with different leaf shapes in aquatic and terrestrial environments. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and can be found in wetlands and along streams.</p>
<p>Its ability to adapt its morphology highlights its evolutionary strategy for nutrient acquisition in challenging conditions.</p>
