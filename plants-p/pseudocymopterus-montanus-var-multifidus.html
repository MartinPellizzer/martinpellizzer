                    <h1>Pseudocymopterus montanus var. multifidus</h1>
<p>Pseudocymopterus montanus var. multifidus, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a variant of the pseudocymopterus montanus species.</p>
<p>It is a fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into multiple segments, giving it a finely branched appearance. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>The multifidus variety is distinguished by its more elaborate and finely divided leaflets compared to other variants of the same species.</p>
