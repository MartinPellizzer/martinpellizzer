                    <h1>Phoradendron fasciculatum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron fasciculatum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or green berries that are often consumed by birds, facilitating seed dispersal. Its leaves are evergreen, and it flowers in the spring, producing small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems by providing food for various animals and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
