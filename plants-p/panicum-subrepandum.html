                    <h1>Panicum subrepandum</h1>
<p>Panicum subrepandum, commonly known as silverleaf panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces narrow, cylindrical spikelets that are typically found in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open fields and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for erosion control and landscape use.</p>
