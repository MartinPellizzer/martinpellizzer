                    <h1>Psilotum × intermedium</h1>
<p>Psilotum × intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate whisk fern, is a hybrid plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique structure, featuring a rootstock with whorled, scale-like leaves and sporangia that are clustered in spore-producing structures called sporophylls. This plant is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. It exhibits a primitive morphology, resembling ancient ferns, and is considered a living fossil due to its evolutionary significance.</p>
<p>The plant plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
