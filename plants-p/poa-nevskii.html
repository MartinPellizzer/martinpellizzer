<p>Poa nevskii, commonly known as Nevska's bluegrass, is a rare and endemic grass species native to the Russian Far East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both bisexual and male flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Poa nevskii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
