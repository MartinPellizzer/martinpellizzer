                    <h1>Pedilonum fornicatum</h1>
<p>Pedilonum fornicatum, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive hood-like structure formed by the fusion of its petals and sepals, which encloses the reproductive organs. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to cool, humid environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pedilonum fornicatum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
