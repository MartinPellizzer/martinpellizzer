                    <h1>Panax victoriae</h1>
<p>Panax victoriae, commonly known as the Victoria ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Australian Alps.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and distinctive, red-brown tuberous roots. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role in the ecological balance of its native region.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
