<p>Pseudocoeloglossum taeniodema, commonly known as the slender lepidocarpeous fern, is a member of the Lepidoziaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, tropical environments. The plant has a distinctive, compact rosette of lanceolate, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, stalked clusters on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>This species is often found in shaded, moist habitats and is relatively rare in the wild.</p>
