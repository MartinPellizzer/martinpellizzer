                    <h1>Parsonsia linearis</h1>
<p>Parsonsia linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flame vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Australia and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and clusters of bright orange to red tubular flowers. The plant is a vigorous climber, often found growing along fences, trees, or in rocky habitats. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure.</p>
<p>Parsonsia linearis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display.</p>
