                    <h1>Pfaffia fruticulosa</h1>
<p>Pfaffia fruticulosa, commonly known as cura√ßao root, is a perennial shrub native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its branched, woody stems and small, greenish flowers. The plant is known for its deep root system, which allows it to thrive in sandy, coastal soils. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Pfaffia fruticulosa has been used traditionally for its potential medicinal properties, though its botanical features are more notable than its pharmacological applications.</p>
