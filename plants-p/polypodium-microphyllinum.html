                    <h1>Polypodium microphyllinum</h1>
<p>Polypodium microphyllinum, commonly known as the small-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
