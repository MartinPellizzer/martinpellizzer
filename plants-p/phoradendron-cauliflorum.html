                    <h1>Phoradendron cauliflorum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron cauliflorum, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Caribbean, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, evergreen leaves and small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces fleshy, red berries that are a food source for various birds and animals. Its growth is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
