                    <h1>Pycnocoma gigantea var. calcicola</h1>
<p>Pycnocoma gigantea var. calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola pycnocoma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and succulent leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, adapting to pollination by insects. It is well-suited to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous or desert-like habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapes or rock gardens.</p>
