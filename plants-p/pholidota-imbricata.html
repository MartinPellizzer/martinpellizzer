                    <h1>Pholidota imbricata</h1>
<p>Pholidota imbricata, commonly known as the African cactus or African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem covered in spiny, scale-like structures that provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Pholidota imbricata is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and can survive prolonged droughts due to its succulent nature.</p>
