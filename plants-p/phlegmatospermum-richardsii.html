This plant is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures are simple and lack the complex floral organs seen in more advanced plants.</p>
<p>Phlegmatospermum richardsii is considered a living fossil, offering insights into early plant evolution.</p>
