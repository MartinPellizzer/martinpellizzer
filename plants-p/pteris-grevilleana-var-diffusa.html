                    <h1>Pteris grevilleana var. diffusa</h1>
<p>Pteris grevilleana var. diffusa, commonly known as the Grevillea fern, is a variant of the Grevillea fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps over time. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded garden settings.</p>
