                    <h1>Paraleptochilus ovatus</h1>
<p>Paraleptochilus ovatus, commonly known as the oval leathery liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Lejeuneaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leaf-like structures called thalli, which are typically green and closely adherent to surfaces such as rocks or soil. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, relying instead on a system of specialized cells for nutrient absorption. It reproduces through spores, which are released from capsules that develop on the underside of the thallus.</p>
<p>Paraleptochilus ovatus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
