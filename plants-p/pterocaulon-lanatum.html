                    <h1>Pterocaulon lanatum</h1>
<p>Pterocaulon lanatum, commonly known as the woolly pterocaulon, is a unique succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in areas with limited rainfall. Its leaves are small and scale-like, reducing surface area to minimize evaporation.</p>
<p>Pterocaulon lanatum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, making it a resilient and specialized member of its ecosystem.</p>
