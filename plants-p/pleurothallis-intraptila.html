<p>Pleurothallis intraptila, commonly known as the "saddle-back orchid," is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It is a small epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features intricate, delicate flowers with a distinctive saddle-shaped lip, which is a characteristic trait of many pleurothallis species. Its blossoms typically range in color from white to pale yellow, and they are often fragrant.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, Pleurothallis intraptila is of interest to botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike.</p>
