                    <h1>Polypodium whartonianum</h1>
<p>Polypodium whartonianum, commonly known as the Wharton's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
