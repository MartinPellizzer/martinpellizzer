                    <h1>Potamogeton × suecicus var. cuspidatus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × suecicus var. cuspidatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as lakes and slow-moving rivers. Its roots help stabilize sediments, contributing to water clarity and habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The species is often found in nutrient-rich waters and can be an indicator of eutrophic conditions.</p>
