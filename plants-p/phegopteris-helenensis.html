                    <h1>Phegopteris helenensis</h1>
<p>Phegopteris helenensis, commonly known as the Helen's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in its survival by deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>This unique feature makes it a rare and visually striking plant in its natural habitat.</p>
