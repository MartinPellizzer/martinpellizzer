<p>Phleum tenue var. ciliatum, commonly known as the silky oat, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value.</p>
