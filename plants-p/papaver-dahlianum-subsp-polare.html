<p>Papaver dahlianum subsp.</p>
<p>polare, commonly known as the polar poppy, is a rare and cold-adapted species native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet to blue flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in harsh, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in cold climates.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its resilience and is considered an indicator of extreme environmental conditions.</p>
