                    <h1>Paspalum psammophilum</h1>
<p>Paspalum psammophilum, commonly known as the sand paspalum, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit and its ability to thrive in sandy soils with minimal water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and坚韧, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Paspalum psammophilum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and soil-stabilizing properties.</p>
