<p>Polypodium ciliolatum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered with fine, hair-like structures, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
