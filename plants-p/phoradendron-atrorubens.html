                    <h1>Phoradendron atrorubens</h1>
<p>Phoradendron atrorubens, commonly known as the red-rust mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It possesses a distinctive appearance with dark red, velvety leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it produces its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis. Its berries, which are bright red and fleshy, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>The species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and supporting avian populations.</p>
