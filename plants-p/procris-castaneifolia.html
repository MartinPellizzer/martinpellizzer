                    <h1>Procris castaneifolia</h1>
<p>Procris castaneifolia, commonly known as the horse chestnut tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which resemble those of the horse chestnut, and its showy white flowers that appear in spring. The tree produces spiny capsules containing toxic seeds, which are not suitable for human consumption. It thrives in temperate climates and is often planted for its ornamental value and shade.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that its seeds and leaves can be poisonous to both humans and animals.</p>
