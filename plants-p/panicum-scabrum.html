                    <h1>Panicum scabrum</h1>
<p>Panicum scabrum, commonly known as rough panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or disturbed soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture, and its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of bristly spikelets. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is often used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
