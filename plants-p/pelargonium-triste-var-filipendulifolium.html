<p>Pelargonium triste var. filipendulifolium, commonly known as the weeping geranium, is a unique cultivar of the geranium genus native to South Africa.</p>

The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a silvery-gray underside, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months.</p>
<p>This plant is often cultivated as a decorative specimen in gardens or as a houseplant due to its elegant form and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
