<p>Phelypaea sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters at the water's surface.</p>
<p>Phelypaea sicula plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
