                    <h1>Pyrethrum haussknechtii</h1>
<p>Pyrethrum haussknechtii, commonly known as the Haussecknecht's pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like inflorescence composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes on its leaves and stems, which contribute to its natural insect-repelling properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its chemical composition, it has been studied for potential use in organic pest control.</p>
