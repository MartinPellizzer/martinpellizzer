                    <h1>Polypodium cheilostictum var. cooperi</h1>
<p>Polypodium cheilostictum var. cooperi, commonly known as the Cooper's holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are dark green with a slightly wavy margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in such habitats.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
