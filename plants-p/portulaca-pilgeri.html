                    <h1>Portulaca pilgeri</h1>
<p>Portulaca pilgeri, commonly known as the desert purslane, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, succulent leaves and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is adapted to hot, dry environments, with a shallow root system that allows it to absorb moisture efficiently. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Portulaca pilgeri is often considered a weed in agricultural settings but plays a role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems.</p>
