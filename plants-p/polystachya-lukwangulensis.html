<p>Polystachya lukwangulensis, commonly known as the Lukwangulensis ginger orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, showy inflorescences. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
