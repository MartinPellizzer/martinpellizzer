<p>Polypodium tenericaule, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, anchoring itself with its rhizomes and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>Polypodium tenericaule thrives in humid, shaded environments, making it a common sight in tropical rainforests.</p>
