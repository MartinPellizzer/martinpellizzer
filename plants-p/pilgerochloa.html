<p>Pilgerochloa, commonly known as the desert barley, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly in the Sahel and parts of the Sahara. The plants are characterized by their slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. They are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Pilgerochloa species are often used as forage plants for livestock in regions where traditional grasses may not thrive.</p>
