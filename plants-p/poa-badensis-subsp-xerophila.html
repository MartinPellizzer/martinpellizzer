<p>Poa badensis subsp.</p>
<p>xerophila, commonly known as the desert bluegrass, is a perennial grass species adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, narrow leaves, and compact inflorescence.</p>
<p>The plant exhibits xerophytic traits, including reduced leaf surface area and deep root systems to conserve water. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils across regions with limited precipitation.</p>
<p>Its ecological significance lies in its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for desert-dwelling fauna.</p>
