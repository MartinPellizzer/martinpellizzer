                    <h1>Pontederia falciloba</h1>
<p>Pontederia falciloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water hyacinth, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, often with a waxy coating that aids in water repellence. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers with prominent violet sepals, which bloom in summer. It is often found in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in non-native regions.</p>
