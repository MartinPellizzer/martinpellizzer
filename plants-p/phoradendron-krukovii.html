                    <h1>Phoradendron krukovii</h1>
<p>Phoradendron krukovii, commonly known as the Krukovii mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that contain sticky seeds. Its leaves are often thick and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its often-dry environment.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Phoradendron krukovii plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by providing food for certain birds and insects.</p>
