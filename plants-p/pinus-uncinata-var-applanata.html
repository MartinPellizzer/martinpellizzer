                    <h1>Pinus uncinata var. applanata</h1>
<p>Pinus uncinata var. applanata, commonly known as the flatneedle pine, is a rare and specialized variant of the Spanish pine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more rigid compared to the typical pine needles. This variety is adapted to specific microhabitats, often found in rocky or high-altitude environments. Its cones are small and typically remain closed for a long period, which is a unique reproductive trait.</p>
<p>The plant plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its native mountainous regions.</p>
