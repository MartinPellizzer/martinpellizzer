                    <h1>Pteris pallida</h1>
<p>Pteris pallida, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that have a silvery appearance due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Pteris pallida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
