                    <h1>Picea abies var. pygmaea</h1>
<p>Picea abies var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf Norway spruce, is a small evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, dense branches, which give it a spherical or cushion-like appearance. The foliage consists of dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of the standard Norway spruce. This variety is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, thriving in poor, rocky soils and cold climates.</p>
<p>It is often used in rock gardens or as a decorative plant due to its unique size and hardy nature.</p>
