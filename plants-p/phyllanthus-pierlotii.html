<p>Phyllanthus pierlotii, commonly known as the African buttonweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent-like leaves. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and usually have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small seeds, aiding in its dispersal by wind or animals.</p>
