                    <h1>Polypodium lineare f. contortum</h1>
<p>Polypodium lineare f. contortum, commonly known as the twisted wall fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often contorted fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a unique twisting pattern that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive biology.</p>
