                    <h1>Phlegmariurus ophioglossoides</h1>
<p>Phlegmariurus ophioglossoides, commonly known as the common huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in small, terminal clusters called synangia, which are borne on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its primitive morphology and is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
