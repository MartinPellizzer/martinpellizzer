<p>melitense, commonly known as the Maltese water fern, is a fern species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Malta and parts of southern Europe. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant features fronds that are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomorphs, which help in anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture.</p>
