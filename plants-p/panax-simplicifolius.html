<p>Panax simplicifolius, commonly known as the simple-leaf ginseng, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Araliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, unlobed leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red berries containing several seeds. Native to specific regions in East Asia, it thrives in shaded, moist forest environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and slow growth, it is considered a valuable but endangered botanical species.</p>
