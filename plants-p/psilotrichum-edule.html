<p>Psilotrichum edule, commonly known as the edible clubmoss, is a member of the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features simple, linear leaves that arise from a short, creeping stem. It produces sporangia on specialized structures called sporophylls, which are arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>While not a true moss, it exhibits some primitive features of vascular plants.</p>
