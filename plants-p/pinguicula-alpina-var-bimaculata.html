                    <h1>Pinguicula alpina var. bimaculata</h1>
<p>Pinguicula alpina var. bimaculata, commonly known as the alpine butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It possesses sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest small insects, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are usually green with distinctive yellow or reddish markings, and it produces small, white or pink flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude conditions where few other plants can survive.</p>
