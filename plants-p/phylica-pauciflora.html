                    <h1>Phylica pauciflora</h1>
<p>Phylica pauciflora, commonly known as the coastal phylica, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in areas exposed to wind and salt spray. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Phylica pauciflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and drought tolerance.</p>
