                    <h1>Pinalia quinquelamellosa</h1>
<p>Pinalia quinquelamellosa, commonly known as the five-winged pinyon, is a rare and unique species native to the high elevations of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive five-winged fruits, which are adapted for wind dispersal in its mountainous habitat. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with both male and female flowers present on the same plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Pinalia quinquelamellosa is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
