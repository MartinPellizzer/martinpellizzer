<p>Platanthera chlorantha subsp.</p>
<p>holmboei, commonly known as the Holmboe's yellow twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to moist, calcareous habitats such as mossy woodlands and stream banks. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is crucial for its survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
