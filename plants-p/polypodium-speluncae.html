                    <h1>Polypodium speluncae</h1>
<p>Polypodium speluncae, commonly known as the cave fern, is a rare and specialized fern species adapted to life in dark, humid environments such as caves and rock crevices.</p>
<p>It thrives in low-light conditions and relies on moisture from the surrounding environment to survive. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are typically small and closely clustered. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are often found on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, Polypodium speluncae is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental stability in subterranean ecosystems.</p>
