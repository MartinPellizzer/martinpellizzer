                    <h1>Piriqueta xylocarpa</h1>
<p>Piriqueta xylocarpa, commonly known as the Mexican rosewood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
