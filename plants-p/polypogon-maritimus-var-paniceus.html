                    <h1>Polypogon maritimus var. paniceus</h1>
<p>Polypogon maritimus var. paniceus, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in saline or brackish soils and is often found in dunes, marshes, and tidal flats.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize coastal soils makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
