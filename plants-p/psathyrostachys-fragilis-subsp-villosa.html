<p>Psathyrostachys fragilis subsp.</p>
<p>villosa, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its subspecific name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or red hues.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological adaptations and potential use in restoration projects.</p>
