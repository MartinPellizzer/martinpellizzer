                    <h1>Polypodium serpentinum</h1>
<p>Polypodium serpentinum, commonly known as the serpentine fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rock surfaces or in crevices. The plant has a distinctive, creeping rhizome with fronds that are usually leathery and divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils, particularly those rich in serpentine rock, which is why it is often found in rocky, mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate harsh conditions makes it an important indicator species for serpentine habitats.</p>
