                    <h1>Phelipanche sevanensis</h1>
<p>Phelipanche sevanensis, commonly known as the Caucasian broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often inconspicuous and lack petals. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host, with seeds remaining dormant in the soil for extended periods.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health and productivity of agricultural crops.</p>
