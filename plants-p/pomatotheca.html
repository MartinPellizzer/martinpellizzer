                    <h1>Pomatotheca</h1>
<p>Pomatotheca, commonly known as the "fruit case," is a unique botanical structure found in certain seed plants.</p>
<p>It serves as a protective covering for the developing seeds, often resembling a small, hardened capsule or shell. The pomatotheca is typically composed of modified ovary walls and may contain specialized cells that aid in seed dispersal. In some species, it may also play a role in water retention or nutrient storage.</p>
<p>This structure is particularly notable in plants of the family Cucurbitaceae, where it contributes to the plant's reproductive success.</p>
