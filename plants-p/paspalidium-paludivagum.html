<p>Paspalidium paludivagum, commonly known as the swampgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, often waterlogged soils, making it common in wetlands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments.</p>
