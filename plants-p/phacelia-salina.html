<p>Phacelia salina, commonly known as saltbush phacelia, is a flowering plant native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant has adapted to high-salt conditions through specialized structures that help excrete excess sodium. Its leaves are often hairy, which aids in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Phacelia salina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils in saline habitats.</p>
