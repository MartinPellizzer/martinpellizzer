                    <h1>Phleboanthe</h1>
<p>Phleboanthe, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. They are characterized by their succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Phleboanthe species are typically shrubs or small trees, adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Their ability to store water in their thick stems and leaves makes them well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
