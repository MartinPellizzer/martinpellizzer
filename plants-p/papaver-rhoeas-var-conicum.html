                    <h1>Papaver rhoeas var. conicum</h1>
<p>Papaver rhoeas var. conicum, commonly known as the cone poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its unique, conical-shaped flower head.</p>
<p>This plant is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The flowers are typically bright red or orange, with a dense, compact structure that sets it apart from the more loosely arranged flowers of the standard Papaver rhoeas. It blooms in the summer months and is known for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
<p>The plant is also used in traditional medicine for its potential analgesic properties.</p>
