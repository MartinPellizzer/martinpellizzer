                    <h1>Potentilla turfosa</h1>
<p>Potentilla turfosa, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender stems and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ability to spread vigorously make it an effective plant for stabilizing slopes and preventing erosion.</p>
