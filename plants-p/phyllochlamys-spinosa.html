                    <h1>Phyllochlamys spinosa</h1>
<p>Phyllochlamys spinosa, commonly known as the spiny leaf fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, spiny leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, providing a unique structural appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are usually dark green with a rough texture, and the spines are thought to serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
