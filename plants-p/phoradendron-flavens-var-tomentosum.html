                    <h1>Phoradendron flavens var. tomentosum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron flavens var. tomentosum, commonly known as the silky mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host, while also contributing to the ecological dynamics of the forest canopy.</p>
