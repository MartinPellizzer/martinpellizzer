                    <h1>Poa uliginosa</h1>
<p>Poa uliginosa, commonly known as cotton grass, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in wet, boggy environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton balls, which are produced in late summer. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, narrow leaves that are often submerged in water. It plays an important role in stabilizing peat bogs and supporting biodiversity in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Poa uliginosa is adapted to nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and is often found in Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
