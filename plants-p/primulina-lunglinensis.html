<p>Primulina lunglinensis, commonly known as the Lunglin's primula, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes numerous ornamental and horticulturally significant plants. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with rosettes of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are typically tubular with brightly colored petals, often in shades of pink or white, and are adapted for pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Primulina lunglinensis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
