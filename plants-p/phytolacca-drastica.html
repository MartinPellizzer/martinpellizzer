                    <h1>Phytolacca drastica</h1>
<p>Phytolacca drastica, commonly known as the Indian cocklebur, is a herbaceous plant native to Asia and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny, spherical fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it a potential weed in agricultural settings. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for human consumption and is more commonly encountered in natural habitats.</p>
