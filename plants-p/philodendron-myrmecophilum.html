                    <h1>Philodendron myrmecophilum</h1>
<p>Philodendron myrmecophilum, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and ability to form a dense canopy that shelters ants. The plant has specialized structures called domatia, which provide shelter for ant colonies. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and help in nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Its unique symbiotic relationship with ants makes it an interesting subject in ecological studies.</p>
