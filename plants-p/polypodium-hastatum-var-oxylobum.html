                    <h1>Polypodium hastatum var. oxylobum</h1>
<p>Polypodium hastatum var. oxylobum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy green fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is fibrous and serves as a storage organ for nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are clustered in groups.</p>
