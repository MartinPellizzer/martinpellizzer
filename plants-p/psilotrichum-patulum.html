                    <h1>Psilotrichum patulum</h1>
<p>Psilotrichum patulum, commonly known as the slender whisk fern, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, branching structure and the absence of true leaves, instead having small, scale-like structures called sporophylls. The plant produces sporangia on the upper surface of these sporophylls, which release spores for reproduction. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its ancient lineage, it provides valuable insights into the evolutionary history of vascular plants.</p>
