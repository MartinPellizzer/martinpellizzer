                    <h1>Pleurocarpaea denticulata</h1>
<p>Pleurocarpaea denticulata, commonly known as the toothed pleurocarp, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. The plant's leaves are closely appressed and have a distinctive denticulate margin, contributing to its common name. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures.</p>
<p>Pleurocarpaea denticulata is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and habitat conditions due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
