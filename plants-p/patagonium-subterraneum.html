                    <h1>Patagonium subterraneum</h1>
<p>Patagonium subterraneum, commonly known as the subterranean grass, is a unique plant native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense, grass-like foliage. The plant thrives in harsh, high-altitude environments with limited soil and extreme temperature fluctuations. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish itself in rocky, nutrient-poor substrates.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its ability to survive in subterranean conditions, with some parts of its root system extending deep into the soil.</p>
