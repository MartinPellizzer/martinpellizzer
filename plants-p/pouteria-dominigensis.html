<p>Pouteria dominigensis, commonly known as the Dominican mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Dominica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, dark green,革质 (leathery) leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by oval, smooth, and glossy fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a significant resource in local economies.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered.</p>
