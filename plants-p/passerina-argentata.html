<p>Passerina argentata, commonly known as the silverleaf pasqueflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and showy, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine environments. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, are pollinated primarily by bees and other early-season pollinators.</p>
