                    <h1>Phoradendron krameri</h1>
<p>Phoradendron krameri, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Caribbean, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Ficus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using limited chlorophyll. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the berries, facilitating its spread to new hosts.</p>
<p>The plant's unique ecological role makes it an important component of tropical forest ecosystems.</p>
