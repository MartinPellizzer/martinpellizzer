                    <h1>Pteris interrupta</h1>
<p>Pteris interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into segments with a distinctive interrupted pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thin layer of spongy tissue, which helps it absorb moisture from the environment.</p>
<p>Pteris interrupta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
