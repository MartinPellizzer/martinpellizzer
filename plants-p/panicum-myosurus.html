<p>Panicum myosurus, commonly known as mouse-tail grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, drooping inflorescences that resemble a mouse's tail, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, pale green to brown spikelets.</p>
