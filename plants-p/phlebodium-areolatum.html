                    <h1>Phlebodium areolatum</h1>
<p>Phlebodium areolatum, commonly known as the golden staghorn fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's fronds are distinctive, with a velvety, golden-green appearance and a unique, shield-like shape. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens.</p>
