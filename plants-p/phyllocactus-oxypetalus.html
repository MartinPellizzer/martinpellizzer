                    <h1>Phyllocactus oxypetalus</h1>
<p>Phyllocactus oxypetalus, commonly known as the velvet cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety spines that provide protection against herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming during the warmer months. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in low-nutrient, dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
