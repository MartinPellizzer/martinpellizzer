                    <h1>Podostemum dimorphum</h1>
<p>Podostemum dimorphum, commonly known as the two-form water plant, is a rare aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, with its leaves often submerged in water while its flowers emerge above the water surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as streams and ponds. Its reproductive strategy involves both self-pollination and cross-pollination, which contributes to its genetic diversity.</p>
<p>Podostemum dimorphum plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
