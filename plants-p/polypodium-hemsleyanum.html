<p>Polypodium hemsleyanum, commonly known as the Hemsley's hart's-tongue fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, leathery, and evergreen fronds that resemble a hart's tongue in shape. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
