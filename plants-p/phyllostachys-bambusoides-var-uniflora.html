<p>Phyllostachys bambusoides var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower bamboo, is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is a clump-forming bamboo that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters, with slender, greenish-brown stems that have a smooth, almost glabrous surface. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with only one or two flowers, which is a distinguishing feature of the varietal name "uniflora.". Its leaves are long, narrow, and slightly curled at the edges, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
<p>This bamboo is well-suited for cultivation in temperate climates and is often used in landscape design for its elegant appearance and hardy nature.</p>
