                    <h1>Prenanthes lyrata</h1>
<p>Prenanthes lyrata, commonly known as the lyrata water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are floating on the water surface, with a distinct stalk connecting them to the submerged roots. The plant produces tiny white flowers in clusters, which bloom from July to September. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy layer that helps repel water, aiding in buoyancy.</p>
<p>Prenanthes lyrata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and invertebrates.</p>
