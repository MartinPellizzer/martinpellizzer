                    <h1>Potentilla pacifica</h1>
<p>Potentilla pacifica, commonly known as Sitka silverweed, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid or rocky habitat. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in umbels, blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Potentilla pacifica thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas, meadows, and disturbed sites.</p>
