<p>Phacelia bipinnatifida var. brevistylis, commonly known as the narrow-styled phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnatifid leaves, which are finely divided and give the plant a delicate, fern-like appearance. The species produces clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry slopes and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
