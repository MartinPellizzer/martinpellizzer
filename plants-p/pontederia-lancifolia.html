<p>Pontederia lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pickerelweed, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 15 centimeters long and have a distinctive pointed tip. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils and is often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of lakes.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
