                    <h1>Phoradendron gentlei</h1>
<p>Phoradendron gentlei, commonly known as the gentle's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of oak trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also deriving some of its own through photosynthesis using the limited light it receives. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are a food source for various bird species. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, allowing the plant to spread to new hosts.</p>
<p>Phoradendron gentlei is often found in the southeastern United States, particularly in regions with a warm, humid climate.</p>
