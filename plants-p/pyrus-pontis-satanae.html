<p>Pyrus pontis-satanae, commonly known as the Pontic-Satana pear, is a rare and ancient species of pear native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elongated fruits with a thin, smooth skin that ranges in color from yellow to reddish-brown. The plant typically grows in mountainous areas with well-drained soil and requires a cold winter to produce fruit. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while the flowers are white with five petals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus pontis-satanae is considered a botanically significant but endangered species.</p>
