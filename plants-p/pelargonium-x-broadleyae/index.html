                            <h1>Pelargonium × Broadleyae</h1>
<p>Broadley's geranium, scientifically known as Pelargonium × broadleyae, is a striking hybrid plant native to South Africa. This species is celebrated for its vibrant flowers and unique foliage, making it a popular choice among horticulturists and garden enthusiasts. First introduced to the international plant trade in the early 20th century, it has since gained a reputation for its adaptability and ornamental value. Its ability to thrive in a variety of climates has contributed to its widespread cultivation. Despite its popularity, Broadley's geranium remains a relatively rare and sought-after specimen in the world of botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
