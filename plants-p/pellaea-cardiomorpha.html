<p>Pellaea cardiomorpha, commonly known as the heart-shaped fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in its ecological interactions.</p>
