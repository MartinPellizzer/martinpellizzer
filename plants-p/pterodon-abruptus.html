                    <h1>Pterodon abruptus</h1>
<p>Pterodon abruptus, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil, where it thrives in moist, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich, dark coloration, making it a sought-after material in musical instrument crafting.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered critically endangered.</p>
