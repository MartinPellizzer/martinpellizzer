<p>Paphiopedilum boxallii, commonly known as Boxall's lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique slipper-shaped pouch, which is a distinctive feature of the Paphiopedilum genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white with intricate patterns, and it blooms once or twice a year.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is highly threatened in the wild.</p>
