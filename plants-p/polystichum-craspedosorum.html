<p>Polystichum craspedosorum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the southern Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery scales, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups.</p>
<p>Polystichum craspedosorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
