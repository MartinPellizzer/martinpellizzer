                    <h1>Pseudophegopteris rammelooi</h1>
<p>Pseudophegopteris rammelooi, commonly known as the Rammeloo's water fern, is a rare aquatic fern species native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, narrow segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered an endangered species in its native range.</p>
