                    <h1>Poa seredinii</h1>
<p>Poa seredinii, commonly known as the Serediva bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, often hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or reddish in color, and it blooms during the summer months. Poa seredinii thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
