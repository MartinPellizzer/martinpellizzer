                    <h1>Pinus finlaysoniana</h1>
<p>Pinus finlaysoniana, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone pine, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the high elevations of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slow growth rate and ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. The tree has a distinctive appearance with long, needle-like leaves and a conical shape. It produces cones that contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, Pinus finlaysoniana is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
