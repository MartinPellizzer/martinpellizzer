<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are densely packed, giving it a compact and lush appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor into the soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>
