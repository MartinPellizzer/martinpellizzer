                    <h1>Penaea geneiophora</h1>
<p>Penaea geneiophora, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and showy, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. It requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and indirect light, to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Penaea geneiophora is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
