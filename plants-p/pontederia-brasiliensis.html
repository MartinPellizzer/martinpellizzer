<p>Pontederia brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian water hyacinth, is a semi-aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features broad, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with a waxy texture that aids in buoyancy. The plant produces striking blue to purple flower spikes that rise above the foliage, typically blooming in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the surrounding water ecosystem.</p>
<p>It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes.</p>
