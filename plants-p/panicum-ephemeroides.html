<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, typically found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, narrow leaves and clusters of delicate, greenish-white flowers during the summer months. Its rapid growth and short lifespan are adaptations to its harsh, dry habitat.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
