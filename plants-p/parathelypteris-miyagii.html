                    <h1>Parathelypteris miyagii</h1>
<p>Parathelypteris miyagii, commonly known as Miyagi's shield fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the forests of Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in moist soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in its native range.</p>
