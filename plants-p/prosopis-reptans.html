                    <h1>Prosopis reptans</h1>
<p>Prosopis reptans, commonly known as the creeping mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by long, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. It is well-suited for erosion control and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Prosopis reptans plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various desert wildlife species.</p>
