                    <h1>Pleuropteropyrum jeholense</h1>
<p>Pleuropteropyrum jeholense, commonly known as the Jehol pleurostemon, is a rare fossil plant from the Mesozoic era.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring elongated, lanceolate leaves with distinct venation patterns. The plant is primarily known from well-preserved specimens found in the Jehol Group of China. Its structure suggests it was a herbaceous plant adapted to a warm, humid climate.</p>
<p>The study of Pleuropteropyrum jeholense provides important insights into the evolution of early angiosperm-like plants.</p>
