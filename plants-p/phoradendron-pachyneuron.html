                    <h1>Phoradendron pachyneuron</h1>
<p>Phoradendron pachyneuron, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the tropics.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are usually small and scale-like, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by providing food for various animals.</p>
