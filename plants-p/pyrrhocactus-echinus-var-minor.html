<p>Pyrrhocactus echinus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser spiny cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem covered in short, spiny tubercles, giving it a distinctive rugged appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
