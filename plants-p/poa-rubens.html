                    <h1>Poa rubens</h1>
<p>Poa rubens, commonly known as red mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces slender, cylindrical leaves that are typically a bluish-green color, with a reddish tinge on the underside. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers.</p>
<p>Poa rubens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
