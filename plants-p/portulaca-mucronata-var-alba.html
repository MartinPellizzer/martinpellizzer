<p>Portulaca mucronata var. alba, commonly known as white moss rose, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in the morning and close during the heat of the day. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
