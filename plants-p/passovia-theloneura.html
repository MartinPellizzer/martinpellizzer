<p>Passovia theloneura, commonly known as the silverleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southern United States.</p>
<p>It possesses small, leathery, evergreen leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, powdery wax, giving it its characteristic silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its berries are dark blue to black and contain toxic compounds, which can be harmful if ingested.</p>
<p>Passovia theloneura plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects, despite its parasitic nature.</p>
