                    <h1>Pilostyles holtzii</h1>
<p>Pilostyles holtzii, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thread-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden within the foliage of its host. The plant is native to regions of Central and South America, where it typically infests species of the genus Erythroxylum. Its reproductive strategy involves producing minute, wind-dispersed seeds that can germinate on suitable host plants.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle and limited distribution, Pilostyles holtzii is considered a rare and enigmatic member of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
