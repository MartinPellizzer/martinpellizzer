                    <h1>Pinguicula vulgaris var. coerulea</h1>
<p>Pinguicula vulgaris var. coerulea, commonly known as the blue butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, often found in bogs or wet meadows.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to absorb nutrients from captured prey, adapting to its specific ecological niche.</p>
