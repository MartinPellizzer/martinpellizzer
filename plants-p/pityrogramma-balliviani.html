                    <h1>Pityrogramma balliviani</h1>
<p>Pityrogramma balliviani, commonly known as the Ballivi√±a water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's simple, dichotomous branching pattern and lack of true roots make it a unique example of a free-floating fern species.</p>
