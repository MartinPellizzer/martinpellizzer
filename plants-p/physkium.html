                    <h1>Physkium</h1>
<p>Physkium, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly shapes, giving it its eerie appearance. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf surfaces. It is often found in shaded, nutrient-rich waters and is popular in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Physkium plays a role in maintaining water clarity by absorbing excess nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
