                    <h1>Polypodium albidoglaucum</h1>
<p>Polypodium albidoglaucum, commonly known as the white-veined cliff fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green with a bluish-white underside. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori.</p>
