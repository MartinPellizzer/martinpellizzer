<p>Pinus hartwegii subsp.</p>
<p>donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone pine, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, dark green foliage that forms a conical shape.</p>
<p>The tree produces long, narrow cones that release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against wildfires and harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its longevity and is considered a living relic of the prehistoric flora of the region.</p>
