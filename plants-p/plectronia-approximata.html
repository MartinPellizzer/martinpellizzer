<p>Plectronia approximata, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a unique growth habit, often growing as a low shrub with slender, hairy stems. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Plectronia approximata is considered a conservation concern.</p>
