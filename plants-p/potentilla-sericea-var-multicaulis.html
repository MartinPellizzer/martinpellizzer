                    <h1>Potentilla sericea var. multicaulis</h1>
<p>Potentilla sericea var. multicaulis, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
