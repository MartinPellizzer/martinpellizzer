                    <h1>Pleiospora obovata var. brevipedunculata</h1>
<p>Pleiospora obovata var. brevipedunculata, commonly known as the narrow-peduncled pleiospora, is a fungal species belonging to the family Pleosporaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dark brown, spherical to subglobose ascospores, which are typically 20â€“30 micrometers in diameter. The fungus is often found on decaying plant material, particularly in forested areas, where it plays a role in the decomposition process. Its morphology includes a cupulate stroma with a smooth, dark surface.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its shorter peduncles compared to the typical variety of P. obovata.</p>
