                    <h1>Pleurosorus papaverifolius var. nanus</h1>
<p>Pleurosorus papaverifolius var. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf peppergrass, is a low-growing fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white茸毛, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sorus, typically located on the underside of the fronds. It is native to parts of North America and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value.</p>
