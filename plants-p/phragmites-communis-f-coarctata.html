<p>Phragmites communis f. coarctata, commonly known as narrowleaf common reed, is a variant of the common reed characterized by its narrower leaves and reduced growth habit.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has hollow, jointed stems that are often used as nesting material by birds and other wildlife. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This form is often found in disturbed or saline soils, making it an important indicator species for certain wetland ecosystems.</p>
