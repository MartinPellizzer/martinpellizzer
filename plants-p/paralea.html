<p>Paralea, commonly known as the "false lily" or "cushion plant," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are small, mat-forming plants with succulent leaves. The leaves are typically fleshy and arranged in a rosette, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Paralea species are native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in southern Africa and the Mediterranean.</p>
