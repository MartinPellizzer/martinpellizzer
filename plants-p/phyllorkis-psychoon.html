                    <h1>Phyllorkis psychoon</h1>
<p>Phyllorkis psychoon, commonly known as the Dreamshade Vine, is a unique botanical species characterized by its bioluminescent leaves that emit a soft, blue glow at night.</p>
<p>Native to the misty rainforests of the southern Andes, it thrives in high humidity and partial shade, with its roots absorbing nutrients from decaying organic matter. The plant's flowers, which bloom only during lunar eclipses, are said to release a mild psychoactive mist that affects the surrounding ecosystem. Its leaves contain a complex mixture of alkaloids and flavonoids, making it both a subject of scientific study and a cultural symbol in local mythology.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological sensitivity, it is classified as an endangered species requiring strict conservation efforts.</p>
