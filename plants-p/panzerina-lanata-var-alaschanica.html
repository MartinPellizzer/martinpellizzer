<p>Panzerina lanata var. alaschanica, commonly known as the Alashan hairy panzerina, is a rare and unique plant species native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle floral presence to its habitat. Its adaptability to extreme conditions makes it an important species for studying desert flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
