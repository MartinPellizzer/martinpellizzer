<p>Pedicularis refracta f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered lousewort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its parasitic or hemiparasitic nature, though it primarily relies on its host plants for water and nutrients. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs and produces showy, tubular flowers with white petals. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is often found in rocky or open mountainous areas with well-drained soils.</p>
