                    <h1>Perityle vaseyi</h1>
<p>Perityle vaseyi, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a compact, mat-like growth habit, making it well adapted to harsh desert conditions. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Perityle vaseyi is often found in crevices and along canyon walls, where it thrives in full sun and minimal rainfall.</p>
