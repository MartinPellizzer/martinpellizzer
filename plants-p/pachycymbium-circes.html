                    <h1>Pachycymbium circes</h1>
<p>Pachycymbium circes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, white, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to cling to tree bark. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees in dense forest canopies.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, Pachycymbium circes is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
