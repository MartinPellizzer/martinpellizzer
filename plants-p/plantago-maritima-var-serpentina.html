                    <h1>Plantago maritima var. serpentina</h1>
<p>Plantago maritima var. serpentina, commonly known as sea plantain or saltworts, is a coastal plant adapted to saline and sandy environments.</p>
<p>It has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and other coastal habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salinity and wind makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
