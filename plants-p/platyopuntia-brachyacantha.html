<p>Platyopuntia brachyacantha, commonly known as the short-spined prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in dense clusters of short, spiny tubercles. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in providing food and shelter for local wildlife.</p>
