                    <h1>Paspalum platicaulon var. gracilius</h1>
<p>Paspalum platicaulon var. gracilius, commonly known as slender paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the tropical and subtropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and seasonally flooded areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
