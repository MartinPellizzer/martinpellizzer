                    <h1>Potentilla leucophylla</h1>
<p>Potentilla leucophylla, commonly known as white-leaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that reflect light and reduce water loss, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control.</p>
<p>Potentilla leucophylla is often found in rocky slopes and meadows at high elevations.</p>
