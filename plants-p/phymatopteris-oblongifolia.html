<p>Phymatopteris oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>The fern's delicate, feathery appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
