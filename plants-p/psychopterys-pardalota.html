<p>Psychopterys pardalota, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Psychopterys pardalota is well adapted to survive in extreme conditions, storing water in its thick stems and thriving in full sun.</p>
