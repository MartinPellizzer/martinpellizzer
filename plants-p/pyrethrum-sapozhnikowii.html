                    <h1>Pyrethrum sapozhnikowii</h1>
<p>Pyrethrum sapozhnikowii, commonly known as the Siberian pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes on its leaves and stems, which are responsible for synthesizing pyrethrinsâ€”natural insecticides. Pyrethrum sapozhnikowii thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and potential use in organic pest control.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in both horticulture and botanical research.</p>
