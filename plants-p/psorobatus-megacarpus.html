<p>Psorobatus megacarpus, commonly known as the giant sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the deserts of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant has adapted to arid environments with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize sandy soils effectively.</p>
<p>Psorobatus megacarpus plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
