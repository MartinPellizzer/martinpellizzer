                    <h1>Pteris tremula</h1>
<p>Pteris tremula, commonly known as the trembling fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that sway easily in the wind, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and colonize new areas. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Pteris tremula prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
