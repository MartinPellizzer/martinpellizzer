                    <h1>Polypodium × font-queri</h1>
<p>Polypodium × font-queri, commonly known as the hybrid wall fern, is a fern species resulting from the cross between Polypodium vulgare and Polypodium polycarpon.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. The plant features lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a membrane known as the indusium.</p>
<p>This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>
