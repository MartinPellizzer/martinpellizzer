                    <h1>Phyllanthus rupestris var. genuinus</h1>
<p>Phyllanthus rupestris var. genuinus, commonly known as the rock phyllanthus, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. It is well-suited for xerophytic gardens due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it an attractive ornamental plant in rock gardens and as a ground cover.</p>
