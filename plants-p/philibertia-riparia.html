                    <h1>Philibertia riparia</h1>
<p>Philibertia riparia, commonly known as the riverbank filbert, is a perennial herb native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and other wetland habitats. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard, woody capsule, which splits open to release the seeds.</p>
<p>Philibertia riparia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
