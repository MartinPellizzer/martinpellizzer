<p>Pteris squamipes, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the substrate.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi-directionally divided, giving the plant its distinctive, lace-like appearance.</p>
