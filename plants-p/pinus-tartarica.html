                    <h1>Pinus tartarica</h1>
<p>Pinus tartarica, commonly known as the Siberian pine, is a coniferous tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Mongolia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically bundled in groups of five and have a bluish-green color. The tree produces cones that are woody and often remain attached to the branches for many years. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The Siberian pine is valued for its resilience and is often used in reforestation efforts in arid and cold regions.</p>
