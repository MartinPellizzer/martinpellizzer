<p>Polypodium punctatum subsp.</p>
<p>subirideum, commonly known as the Indian brake fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a distinctive, serrated margin.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and produce roots that help anchor it to moist, rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
