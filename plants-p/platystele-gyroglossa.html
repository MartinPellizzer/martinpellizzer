                    <h1>Platystele gyroglossa</h1>
<p>Platystele gyroglossa, commonly known as the spiral-tongue platystele, is a rare and unique epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its striking, spiral-shaped inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in a tight spiral, making it visually distinctive. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
