                    <h1>Populus × moscoviensis</h1>
<p>Populus × moscoviensis, commonly known as the black poplar, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the white poplar (Populus alba) and the aspen (Populus tremula).</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its dark, almost black bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-7 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins that release pollen in the spring, contributing to its role in wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones, wetlands, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its fast growth and adaptability, it has been widely planted for reforestation and as an ornamental tree.</p>
