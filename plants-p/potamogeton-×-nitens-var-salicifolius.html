                    <h1>Potamogeton × nitens var. salicifolius</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × nitens var. salicifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly pointed. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or floating.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in suitable conditions, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive.</p>
