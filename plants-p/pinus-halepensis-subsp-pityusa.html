<p>Pinus halepensis subsp.</p>
<p>pityusa, commonly known as the Aleppo pine, is a subspecies native to the Mediterranean region. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its cones are serotinous, meaning they remain closed until exposed to heat, often from a fire, which aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays an important role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
