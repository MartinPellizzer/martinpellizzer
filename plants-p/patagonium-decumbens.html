<p>Patagonium decumbens, commonly known as the Patagonian cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial found in the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh environments. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, reducing water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are inconspicuous, typically greenish or reddish, and appear in clusters near the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Patagonium decumbens plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat.</p>
