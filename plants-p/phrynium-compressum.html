<p>Phrynium compressum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers surrounded by a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. Its rhizomes are used as a starch source, similar to arrowroot, and the plant is often grown for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Phrynium compressum thrives in moist, shady environments and is relatively easy to cultivate in warm climates.</p>
