<p>Persicaria ruderalis, commonly known as yellow knotgrass, is a flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ability to thrive in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Persicaria ruderalis is also known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces, making it both a weed and a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
