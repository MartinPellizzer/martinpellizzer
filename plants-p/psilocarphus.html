                    <h1>Psilocarphus</h1>
<p>Psilocarphus, commonly known as the "ghost mushroom," is a genus of fungi within the family Tricholomataceae.</p>
<p>These fungi are typically found in temperate regions and are often associated with decaying wood or leaf litter. They are characterized by their delicate, often pale or ghostly-colored caps and slender stems. Psilocarphus species are generally non-toxic but are sometimes mistaken for edible mushrooms due to their subtle appearance.</p>
<p>Their ecological role includes contributing to the decomposition of organic matter in forest ecosystems.</p>
