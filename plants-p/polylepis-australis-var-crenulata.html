                    <h1>Polylepis australis var. crenulata</h1>
<p>Polylepis australis var. crenulata, commonly known as the Andean polylepis, is a shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and silver-gray bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are typically small, oval, and have a serrated edge, while the flowers are small and clustered in panicles. This species thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, it is considered vulnerable and is of significant ecological importance in its native range.</p>
