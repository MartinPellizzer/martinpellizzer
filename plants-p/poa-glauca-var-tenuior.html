<p>Poa glauca var. tenuior, commonly known as the slender bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense growth habit, making it a popular choice for lawns and ornamental landscapes. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 20 inches and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, and it is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements, it is often used in turfgrass mixes and erosion control applications.</p>
