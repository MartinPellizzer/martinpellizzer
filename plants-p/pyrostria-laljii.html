                    <h1>Pyrostria laljii</h1>
<p>Pyrostria laljii, commonly known as the Lalji's pyrostria, is a rare and unique plant native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its striking, spiky inflorescence that resembles a torch. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Pyrostria laljii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
