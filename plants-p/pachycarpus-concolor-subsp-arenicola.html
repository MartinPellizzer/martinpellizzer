<p>Pachycarpus concolor subsp.</p>
<p>arenicola, commonly known as the coastal dune lichen, is a lichen that thrives in arid and coastal environments. It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form, which helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, enabling it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It is typically found on rocky surfaces or sandy soils near the coast, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate extreme temperatures and salinity makes it an important indicator species for coastal ecosystems.</p>
