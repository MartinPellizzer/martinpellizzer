<p>Prasophyllum incompositum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish or brownish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open forests or heathlands. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
