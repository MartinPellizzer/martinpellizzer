                    <h1>Pedicularis rigida</h1>
<p>Pedicularis rigida, commonly known as the rigid monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is often found growing at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a striking visual element to its natural habitat.</p>
