                    <h1>Pseudosmodingium perniciosum</h1>
<p>Pseudosmodingium perniciosum, commonly known as the toxic blight fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant produces sporangia that are clustered in sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by herbivores and is considered a potential indicator of environmental stress in its habitat.</p>
