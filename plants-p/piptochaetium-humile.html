                    <h1>Piptochaetium humile</h1>
<p>Piptochaetium humile, commonly known as the dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a dense, tufted growth habit, and its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-like structure bearing small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh environments through its deep root system and ability to retain water efficiently. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is used in some regions for livestock forage.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
