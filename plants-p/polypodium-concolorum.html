<p>Polypodium concolorum, commonly known as the smooth polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain green throughout the year. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, forming dense, compact colonies. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium concolorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden environments.</p>
