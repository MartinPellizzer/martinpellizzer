                    <h1>Phoradendron knoopii</h1>
<p>Phoradendron knoopii, commonly known as the knoop's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stem and leaves, which are adapted for this parasitic lifestyle. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and berries that are often dispersed by birds. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological role, it is an important component of forest ecosystems.</p>
