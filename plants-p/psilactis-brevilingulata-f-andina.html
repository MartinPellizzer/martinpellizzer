<p>Psilactis brevilingulata f. andina, commonly known as the Andean psilactis, is a rare fern species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Psilotaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure known as a synangium, which contains the spores necessary for its propagation. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
