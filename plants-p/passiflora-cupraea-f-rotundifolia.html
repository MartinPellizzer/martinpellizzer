<p>Passiflora cupraea f. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf passionflower, is a rare and unique variant of the passionflower genus.</p>

The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with intricate structures typical of the Passiflora family. It is native to specific regions in South America and is often found in shaded, moist environments.</p>
