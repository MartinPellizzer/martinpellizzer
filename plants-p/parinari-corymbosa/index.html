                            <h1>Parinari Corymbosa</h1>
<p>Parinari corymbosa is a tropical tree known for its striking red flowers and edible fruits. Native to Africa and parts of Asia, it thrives in humid climates and is often found in rainforests. The tree's fruit, called the "mangosteen" in some regions, is prized for its sweet, tangy flavor and nutritional value. Its wood is also valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture making. Despite its benefits, the plant faces threats from habitat loss and overharvesting.</p>
