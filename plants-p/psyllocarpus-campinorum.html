<p>Psyllocarpus campinorum, commonly known as the Colombian ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and evergreen foliage, which contributes to its ecological importance in its native habitat. The plant has compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a threatened species in its natural range.</p>
