<p>Parapolystichum munitum, commonly known as the Pacific silver fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, silver-gray fronds that are adorned with fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Parapolystichum munitum plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
