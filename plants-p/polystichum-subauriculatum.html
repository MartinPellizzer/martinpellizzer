<p>Polystichum subauriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, ear-shaped lobes along the margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Polystichum subauriculatum plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
