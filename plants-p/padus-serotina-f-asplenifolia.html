                    <h1>Padus serotina f. asplenifolia</h1>
<p>Padus serotina f. asplenifolia, commonly known as the asplenifoliate whitebeam, is a rare and botanically distinctive variant of the whitebeam tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of the genus Asplenium, giving it its common name. The plant is native to specific regions of Europe, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have a silvery underside.</p>
<p>This form is considered a botanical curiosity due to its unique foliage and limited distribution.</p>
