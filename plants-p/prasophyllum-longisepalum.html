<p>Prasophyllum longisepalum, commonly known as the long-sepal orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces a single, elongated flower spike bearing several pale green to white, fragrant flowers with long, narrow sepals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and heathlands, often growing in sandy or loamy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
