                    <h1>Pomatostoma</h1>
<p>Pomatostoma, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and are often found in rocky or arid environments. They are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to yellow. Pomatostoma species are typically drought-tolerant and have adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology and ecological adaptations make them an important component of their native ecosystems.</p>
