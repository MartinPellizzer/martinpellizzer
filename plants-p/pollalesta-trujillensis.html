                    <h1>Pollalesta trujillensis</h1>
<p>Pollalesta trujillensis, commonly known as the Trujillo orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the coastal regions of northern Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments along the Pacific coast, where it often grows on rocky outcrops or in coastal forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the mist and sea breeze, which is crucial for its survival in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
