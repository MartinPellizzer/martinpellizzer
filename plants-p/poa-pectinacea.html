                    <h1>Poa pectinacea</h1>
<p>Poa pectinacea, commonly known as the cushion grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, dense growth habit, forming compact cushions that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand freezing temperatures makes it an important component of tundra and alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Poa pectinacea plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small invertebrates and birds.</p>
