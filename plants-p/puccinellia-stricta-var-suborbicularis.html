                    <h1>Puccinellia stricta var. suborbicularis</h1>
<p>Puccinellia stricta var. suborbicularis, commonly known as the narrowleaf saltbush, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, suborbicular (nearly round) leaves. The plant is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing degraded lands. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of tiny florets.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
