                    <h1>Psilotrichum ferrugineum</h1>
<p>Psilotrichum ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty psilotum, is a small, herbaceous fern that belongs to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, dichotomous branching pattern and the absence of true leaves, instead possessing small, scale-like structures called rhizomes. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in dense groups on the stems.</p>
<p>Psilotrichum ferrugineum is notable for its primitive morphology, reflecting its ancient lineage among vascular plants.</p>
