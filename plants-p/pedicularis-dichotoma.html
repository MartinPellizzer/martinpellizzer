                    <h1>Pedicularis dichotoma</h1>
<p>Pedicularis dichotoma, commonly known as the forked lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers are usually reddish or orange in color, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, Pedicularis dichotoma is often found in high-altitude environments where competition from other plants is minimal.</p>
