<p>Phragmites australis subsp.</p>
<p>americanus, commonly known as the common reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its hollow, jointed stems and dense, fibrous root system, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The plant produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences that are wind-pollinated, contributing to its widespread distribution. It is highly adaptable, often forming dense monocultures in marshes, shores, and other moist habitats.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and extensive rhizomes make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
