                    <h1>Pinus nesselrodiana</h1>
<p>Pinus nesselrodiana, commonly known as the Nesselrode pine, is a rare and endangered species native to the high elevations of the Andes in Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, straight trunk and needle-like leaves arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are typically 5â€“8 centimeters long, containing edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
