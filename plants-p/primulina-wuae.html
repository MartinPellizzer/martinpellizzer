<p>Primulina wuae, commonly known as the Wuae arrowroot, is a rare tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
