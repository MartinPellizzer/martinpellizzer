                    <h1>Poa nemoralis var. ligulata</h1>
<p>Poa nemoralis var. ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form of Poa nemoralis. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
