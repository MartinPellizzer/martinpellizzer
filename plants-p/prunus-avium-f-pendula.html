                    <h1>Prunus avium f. pendula</h1>
<p>Prunus avium f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping cherry or weeping peach, is a cultivar of the peach tree characterized by its cascading branches that create a distinctive, elegant appearance.</p>
<p>It features showy pink to white flowers in early spring, which bloom before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically less flavorful compared to standard peaches. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental tree in gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often planted for its aesthetic appeal rather than for fruit production.</p>
