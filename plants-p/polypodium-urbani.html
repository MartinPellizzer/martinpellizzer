                    <h1>Polypodium urbani</h1>
<p>Polypodium urbani, commonly known as the urban fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that typically grow in shaded, humid environments. The plant's rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from its substrate. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found on tree trunks or rocks in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
