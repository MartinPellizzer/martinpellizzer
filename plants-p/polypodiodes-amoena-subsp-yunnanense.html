<p>Polypodiodes amoena subsp.</p>
<p>yunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan lady's-tongue, is a fern native to China, particularly in Yunnan Province. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle.</p>
