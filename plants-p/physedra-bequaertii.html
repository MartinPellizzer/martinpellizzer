<p>Physedra bequaertii, commonly known as the Bequaert's bladderworts, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap microscopic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. Native to specific regions in Africa, it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant has a delicate, floating growth form with simple, whorled leaves.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
