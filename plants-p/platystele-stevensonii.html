<p>Platystele stevensonii, commonly known as the Stevenson's ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree branches or rock surfaces.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species.</p>
