<p>Penaea punicea, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, corky bark and its ability to thrive in saline and brackish water environments. The plant has specialized root systems that help it anchor in soft, muddy soils and filter out excess salt. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Penaea punicea plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
