                    <h1>Pteroceras decipiens</h1>
<p>Pteroceras decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive horned fern, is a unique member of the Pteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, often asymmetrical fronds that resemble the shape of a horn, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, stout rhizome with dense, clustered roots that help anchor it in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its propagation in the wild.</p>
