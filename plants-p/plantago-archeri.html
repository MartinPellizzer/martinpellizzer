<p>Plantago archeri, commonly known as the alpine plantain, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>This species is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, harsh climates.</p>
