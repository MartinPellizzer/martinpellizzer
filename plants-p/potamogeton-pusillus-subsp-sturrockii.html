<p>Potamogeton pusillus subsp.</p>
<p>sturrockii, commonly known as Sturrock's narrowleaf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving to still waters, such as lakes, ponds, and canals, where it forms dense underwater vegetation.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are usually less than 2 millimeters wide, and it produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its distribution is often limited to specific water bodies, making it a valuable indicator of water quality and ecological conditions.</p>
