                <h1>Pneumatopteris parksii</h1>
<p>Pneumatopteris parksii, commonly known as the Park's water fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Pneumatopteris parksii is considered a relict species, reflecting its evolutionary history from the Paleozoic era.</p>
