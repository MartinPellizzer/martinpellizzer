<p>Phalangium liliago subsp.</p>
<p>baeticum, commonly known as the Baetican lily, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions, preferring partial shade to full sun. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
