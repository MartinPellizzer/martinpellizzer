                    <h1>Peperomia arabica var. parvifolia</h1>
<p>Peperomia arabica var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are smaller than those of the typical peperomia arabica. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers arranged in spikes, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its compact size and attractive foliage.</p>
