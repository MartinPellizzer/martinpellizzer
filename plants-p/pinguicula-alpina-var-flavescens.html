                    <h1>Pinguicula alpina var. flavescens</h1>
<p>Pinguicula alpina var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and broad, fleshy leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique trapping mechanism and striking appearance, it is a popular subject for both botanists and plant enthusiasts.</p>
