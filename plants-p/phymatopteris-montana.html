<p>Phymatopteris montana, commonly known as the mountain maidenhair fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Phymatopteris montana plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms.</p>
