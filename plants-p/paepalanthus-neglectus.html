<p>Paepalanthus neglectus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant has a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting it to its dry environment. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Paepalanthus neglectus is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its resilience in harsh conditions.</p>
