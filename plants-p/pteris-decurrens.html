                    <h1>Pteris decurrens</h1>
<p>Pteris decurrens, commonly known as the running brake fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that often have a serrated or toothed margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
