<p>Phoradendron oliveirae, commonly known as the Oliveira's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily ficus and myrtles, through its haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
