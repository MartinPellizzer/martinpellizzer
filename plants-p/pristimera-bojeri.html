<p>Pristimera bojeri, commonly known as the Bojer's spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Pristimera bojeri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
