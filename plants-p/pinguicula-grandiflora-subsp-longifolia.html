<p>Pinguicula grandiflora subsp.</p>
<p>longifolia, commonly known as the long-flowered butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Europe. It features small, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects, a key adaptation for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, adding ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity to flourish.</p>
<p>Its subspecies distinction is based on floral morphology and leaf characteristics, distinguishing it from closely related species.</p>
