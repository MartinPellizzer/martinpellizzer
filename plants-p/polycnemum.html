                    <h1>Polycnemum</h1>
<p>Polycnemum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their floating leaves that are divided into four parts, resembling a clover leaf. They typically thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Polycnemum species are often found in temperate regions and are known for their ability to form dense mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>Their reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the leaves, contributing to their ecological role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
