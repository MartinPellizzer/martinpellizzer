<p>Portulaca filamentosa, commonly known as the threadleaf purslane, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, branching stems that are covered in fine, thread-like hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to store water in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Portulaca filamentosa is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
