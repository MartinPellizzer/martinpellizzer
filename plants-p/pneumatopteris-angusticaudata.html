<p>Pneumatopteris angusticaudata, commonly known as the narrow-tailed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are adapted for life in freshwater environments. The plant typically grows in slow-moving streams and ponds, where it anchors itself to submerged surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Pneumatopteris angusticaudata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling.</p>
