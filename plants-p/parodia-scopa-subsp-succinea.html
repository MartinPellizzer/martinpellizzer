<p>Parodia scopa subsp.</p>
<p>succinea, commonly known as the "Cactus Mouse," is a compact, globular cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It features a short, thick stem with a dense covering of white, woolly bristles that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its succulent leaves are modified into spines, which provide protection from herbivores and aid in reducing transpiration.</p>
<p>This subspecies is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant.</p>
