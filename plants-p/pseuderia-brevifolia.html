                    <h1>Pseuderia brevifolia</h1>
<p>Pseuderia brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved spider orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spider-like flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with intricate patterns. The plant has narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette formation, allowing it to conserve moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Pseuderia brevifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires high humidity and indirect light to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is classified as a threatened species under Australian conservation laws.</p>
