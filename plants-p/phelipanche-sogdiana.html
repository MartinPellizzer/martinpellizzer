                    <h1>Phelipanche sogdiana</h1>
<p>Phelipanche sogdiana, commonly known as the Sogdian broomrape, is a root parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to its lack of showy petals. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain viable in the soil for several years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
