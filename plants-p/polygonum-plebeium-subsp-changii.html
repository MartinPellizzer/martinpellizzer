<p>Polygonum plebeium subsp.</p>
<p>changii, commonly known as the Chinese knotweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to red. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive.</p>
