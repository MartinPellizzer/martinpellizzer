<p>Polypodium lechleri, commonly known as the "dragon's blood tree," is a tropical evergreen fern native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds and distinctive, clustered rhizomes. The plant is renowned for its sap, which is a deep red resin used in traditional medicine and as a natural dye. The sap contains high concentrations of anthraquinones, which have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered and is protected in some regions.</p>
