                    <h1>Polystichum annapurnicola</h1>
<p>Polystichum annapurnicola, commonly known as the Annapurna shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lanceolate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in shaded forest areas. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
