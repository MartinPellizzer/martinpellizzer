                    <h1>Paspalum obtusatum</h1>
<p>Paspalum obtusatum, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and other coastal habitats. The plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with narrow, bluish-green leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and can withstand salt spray, making it an important pioneer species in coastal restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion contributes to its ecological significance in maritime environments.</p>
