                    <h1>Poa lapponica var. turiensis</h1>
<p>Poa lapponica var. turiensis, commonly known as Turi's fine fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a low-maintenance ornamental grass in colder climates.</p>
