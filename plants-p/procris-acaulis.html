                    <h1>Procris acaulis</h1>
<p>Procris acaulis, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a splash of color to its rocky habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Procris acaulis is often found in alpine and mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight.</p>
