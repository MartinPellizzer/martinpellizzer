<p>Pereskia grandiflora, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a unique cactus species native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that resemble those of a shrub rather than a typical cactus. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming around the holiday season. It has a shallow root system and thrives in well-drained soil with bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Despite its name, it is not a true cactus but belongs to the Cactaceae family, sharing some structural similarities with other cacti.</p>
