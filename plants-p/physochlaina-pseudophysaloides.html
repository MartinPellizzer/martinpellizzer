<p>Physochlaina pseudophysaloides, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and stems adapted to store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
