                <h1>Platycerium bifurcatum</h1>
<p>Platycerium bifurcatum, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is an epiphytic plant native to Australia and New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, antler-like fronds that grow directly from the central stem. The plant does not have true roots but instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its fronds from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks.</p>
<p>Its distinctive appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens.</p>
