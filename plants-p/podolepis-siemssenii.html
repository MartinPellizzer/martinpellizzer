<p>Podolepis siemssenii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.</p>
<p>It is a bulbous perennial that produces tall, slender stems with showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its alpine habitat. Podolepis siemssenii is considered endangered due to habitat loss and climate change.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
