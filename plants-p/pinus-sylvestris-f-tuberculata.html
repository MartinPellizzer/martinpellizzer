This form is typically found in cooler, more humid environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The cones are similar to those of the standard Scots pine, but the seedlings may show more pronounced variegation.</p>
<p>It is a popular ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardiness.</p>
