<p>Pediocactus bradyi subsp.</p>
<p>winkleri, commonly known as the Winkler's paddle cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are often covered in a layer of white, waxy bloom.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a vibrant contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
