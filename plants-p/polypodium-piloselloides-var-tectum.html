                    <h1>Polypodium piloselloides var. tectum</h1>
<p>Polypodium piloselloides var. tectum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the polypody fern characterized by its distinctive fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a dense covering of short, soft hairs that give it its common name. The sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, arranged in clusters called sori, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its adaptability and is often found in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
