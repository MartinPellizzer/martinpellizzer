                    <h1>Pleopeltis loriformis</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis loriformis, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that often form dense clusters on trees or rocks. The plant produces small, greenish spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
