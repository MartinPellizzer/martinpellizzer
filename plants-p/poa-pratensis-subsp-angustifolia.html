<p>Poa pratensis subsp.</p>
<p>angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf meadow grass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, blade-like leaves that are typically narrower than those of the main species, Poa pratensis.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. Its flowering stems are usually shorter and less branched compared to the main species, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in turfgrass mixes for its fine texture and durability.</p>
