                    <h1>Pityrogramma eggersii</h1>
<p>Pityrogramma eggersii, commonly known as the Eggers' water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to submerged surfaces.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting small aquatic organisms for nutrient absorption.</p>
