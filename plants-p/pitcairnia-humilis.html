                    <h1>Pitcairnia humilis</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf pitcairnia, is a small bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with colorful, showy bracts that range from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
