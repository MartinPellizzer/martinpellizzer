                    <h1>Pimelea prostrata var. repens</h1>
<p>Pimelea prostrata var. repens, commonly known as the prostrate pimelea, is a low-growing shrub native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy ground cover plant.</p>
