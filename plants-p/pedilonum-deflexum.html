<p>Pedilonum deflexum, commonly known as the drooping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Pedilonum deflexum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme environments.</p>
