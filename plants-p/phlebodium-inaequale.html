                    <h1>Phlebodium inaequale</h1>
<p>Phlebodium inaequale, commonly known as the unequal staghorn fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a distinctive frond structure with a thick, leathery rachis and dichotomous branching. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
