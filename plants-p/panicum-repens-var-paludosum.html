                    <h1>Panicum repens var. paludosum</h1>
<p>Panicum repens var. paludosum, commonly known as swamp panicum, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to saturated soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, oat-like seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that help stabilize soil in waterlogged areas.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its ability to tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
