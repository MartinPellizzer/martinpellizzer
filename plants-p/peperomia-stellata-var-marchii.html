<p>Peperomia stellata var. marchii, commonly known as the star peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving them a unique, almost silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, reddish-brown flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, adding a subtle ornamental touch. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its foliage is characterized by a striking contrast between the dark green upper surface and the lighter, sometimes variegated underside.</p>
