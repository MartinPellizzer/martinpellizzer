                    <h1>Penaea dubia</h1>
<p>Penaea dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, thin stem and showy, pale green or white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and threats from deforestation, Penaea dubia is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
