<p>Primula walshii, commonly known as the Walsh's primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a hairy texture, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
