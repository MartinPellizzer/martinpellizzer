                    <h1>Phoradendron holtonis</h1>
<p>Phoradendron holtonis, commonly known as the Holton's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaraceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or pale green flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are adapted for attachment to the host. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, are important food sources for various bird species.</p>
<p>Phoradendron holtonis plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing tree growth and supporting biodiversity.</p>
