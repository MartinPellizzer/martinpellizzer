                    <h1>Polystichum × flemingii</h1>
<p>Polystichum × flemingii, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between *Polystichum acrostichum* and *Polystichum milleflorum*.</p>
<p>It is a hardy evergreen fern that thrives in shady, moist environments, typically found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant features long, arching fronds with a dark green, leathery texture and a distinctive, glossy appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce viable offspring and is propagated through division of its rhizomes.</p>
