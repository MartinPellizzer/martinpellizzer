                    <h1>Populus hudsonica</h1>
<p>Populus hudsonica, commonly known as Hudson's poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across open landscapes. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found near rivers, lakes, and marshes.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
