                    <h1>Pedicularis brachychila</h1>
<p>Pedicularis brachychila, commonly known as the short-stemmed monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its specialized root system. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive, elongated lip that aids in pollination by insects. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
