<p>Polypodium fibrillosum, commonly known as the fibrous shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous rhizomes and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically divided into segments with a leathery texture and a distinctive, shield-like appearance. It produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori.</p>
<p>This plant is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems.</p>
