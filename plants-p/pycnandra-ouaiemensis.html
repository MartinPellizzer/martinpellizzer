                    <h1>Pycnandra ouaiemensis</h1>
<p>Pycnandra ouaiemensis, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which allow it to absorb oxygen from the air in waterlogged soil. The plant's leaves are alternate and elliptical, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries.</p>
<p>This species plays a vital ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
