                    <h1>Parathelypteris auriculata</h1>
<p>Parathelypteris auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds with a distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, aiding in its ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
