                    <h1>Pinus oocarpa var. ochoterenae</h1>
<p>Pinus oocarpa var. ochoterenae, commonly known as the Ochoterenae pine, is a rare variant of the Oocarpa pine native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique needle morphology, with longer and more rigid needles compared to other Pinus species. The cones of this variant are typically larger and more robust, often containing larger seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
