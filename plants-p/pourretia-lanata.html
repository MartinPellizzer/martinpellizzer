                    <h1>Pourretia lanata</h1>
<p>Pourretia lanata, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and is considered a weed in some regions.</p>
