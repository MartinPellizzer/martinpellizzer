                    <h1>Primula spathulifolia</h1>
<p>Primula spathulifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections for its delicate appearance and early spring bloom.</p>
