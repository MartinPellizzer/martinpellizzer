                    <h1>Phragmipedium × merinoi</h1>
<p>Phragmipedium × merinoi, commonly known as the Merino orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and orange, with intricate patterns on the lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
