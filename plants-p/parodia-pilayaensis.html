<p>Parodia pilayaensis, commonly known as the Pilaya cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular shape and spiny, ribbed structure, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10â€“20 centimeters and produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its stems are covered in white, woolly hairs that provide additional protection from intense sunlight and dehydration.</p>
<p>Parodia pilayaensis is well-suited for cultivation in rocky or sandy soils with minimal water requirements.</p>
