                    <h1>Prangos serpentinica</h1>
<p>Prangos serpentinica, commonly known as the serpentine milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, magnesium-rich soils, particularly those derived from serpentine rock. The plant features upright stems with alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellowish-white flowers are arranged in racemate inflorescences, typical of the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>Prangos serpentinica is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions, making it an important species in ecological studies of extreme habitats.</p>
