                    <h1>Picea obovata var. alpestris</h1>
<p>Picea obovata var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to high-altitude regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its narrow, obovate-shaped needles and conical crown. The plant thrives in cold, mountainous climates with well-drained soils, often growing at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its foliage is typically a silvery-gray or white hue, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its resilience and is often used in reforestation and ecological restoration projects in alpine zones.</p>
