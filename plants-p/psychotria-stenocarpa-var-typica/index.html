                            <h1>Psychotria Stenocarpa Var. Typica</h1>
<p>Coffeeberry, scientifically known as Psychotria stenocarpa var. typica, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is recognized for its small, bright red berries that resemble coffee beans, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its berries are not only visually striking but also contain psychoactive compounds, making it a subject of interest in both botanical and ethnobotanical studies. Despite its allure, the Coffeeberry remains relatively obscure and under-researched in the broader scientific community.</p>
