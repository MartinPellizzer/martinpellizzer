                    <h1>Pandanus tessellatus</h1>
<p>Pandanus tessellatus, commonly known as the zigzag palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped leaves that have a zigzag pattern along the midrib. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a spadix, which are followed by fibrous, coconut-like fruits. Its roots are fibrous and help in stabilizing the soil, making it useful for erosion control.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching material.</p>
