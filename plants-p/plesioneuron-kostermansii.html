                    <h1>Plesioneuron kostermansii</h1>
<p>Plesioneuron kostermansii, commonly known as the Kostermans' pteridium, is a rare fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
