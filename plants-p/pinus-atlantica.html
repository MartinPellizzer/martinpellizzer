                    <h1>Pinus atlantica</h1>
<p>Pinus atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are often covered in a thick, resinous coating, which helps protect the seeds from moisture and pests. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
