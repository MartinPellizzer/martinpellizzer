                            <h1>Primulina Annamensis</h1>
<p>Primulina annamensis is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Vietnam. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family, known for its vibrant and often showy flowers. This species is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and delicate, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is now critically endangered and protected in several conservation programs. Its unique beauty and ecological significance make it a subject of both scientific study and botanical fascination.</p>
