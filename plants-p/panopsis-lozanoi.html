<p>Panopsis lozanoi, commonly known as the Lozano's panopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Panopsis lozanoi is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
