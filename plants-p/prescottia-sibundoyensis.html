<p>Prescottia sibundoyensis, commonly known as the Sibundoy puya, is a rare and striking member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to the Andean regions of Colombia, it is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, colorful bracts that display a range of hues. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
