                    <h1>Potamogeton pusillus var. tenuifolius</h1>
<p>Potamogeton pusillus var. tenuifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are often less than 1 cm in width. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which float at the water's surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for nutrient-rich waters, it is often found in eutrophic lakes and ponds.</p>
