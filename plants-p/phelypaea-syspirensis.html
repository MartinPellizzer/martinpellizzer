<p>Phelypaea syspirensis, commonly known as the Florida shield fern, is a rare and endangered fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands and along the edges of swamps. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
