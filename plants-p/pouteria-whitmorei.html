                    <h1>Pouteria whitmorei</h1>
<p>Pouteria whitmorei, commonly known as the Bornean sapodilla, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces edible fruits with a sweet, custard-like pulp, similar to the common sapodilla (Manilkara zapota). Its flowers are small, green, and clustered in panicles, while the fruit develops from an inferior ovary.</p>
<p>Pouteria whitmorei is valued not only for its fruit but also for its ecological role in tropical rainforests.</p>
