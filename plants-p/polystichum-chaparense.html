<p>Polystichum chaparense, commonly known as the Chaparral fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Polystichum chaparense plays an important role in maintaining ecological balance by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
