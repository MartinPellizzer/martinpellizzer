<p>Pilogyne immarginata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense clusters, with slender, grass-like leaves that are narrow and have a distinct midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Pilogyne immarginata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
