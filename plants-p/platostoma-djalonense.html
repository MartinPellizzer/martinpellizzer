<p>Platostoma djalonense, commonly known as the African marsh fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to West Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to its aquatic habitat. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the muddy substrate.</p>
<p>Platostoma djalonense plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland ecosystem by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
