<p>Polypodium vastum, commonly known as the giant wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
