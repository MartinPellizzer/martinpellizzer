                            <h1>Pasania Rajah</h1>
<p>Pasania rajah, scientifically known as Pasania rajah, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. This unique species is characterized by its vibrant, bi-colored leaves that display a striking contrast of deep green and rich red. Often found in shaded, moist environments, Pasania rajah thrives in the understory of dense rainforests. Its ornamental qualities have made it a sought-after plant among horticulturists and botanists alike. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pasania rajah is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
