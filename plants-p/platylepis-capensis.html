                    <h1>Platylepis capensis</h1>
<p>Platylepis capensis, commonly known as the Cape flat lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family and is primarily found in southern Africa.</p>
<p>This plant is a lichen, a composite organism formed by a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is often seen growing on soil, stone, or bark. The thallus of Platylepis capensis is typically crustose, forming a thin, flat layer that adheres tightly to its substrate.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its native habitats.</p>
