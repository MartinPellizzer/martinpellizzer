                            <h1>Potentilla Tabernaemontani Var. Serotina</h1>
<p>Serotina cinquefoil, scientifically known as Potentilla tabernaemontani var. serotina, is a rare and fascinating plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. This variant of the cinquefoil family is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in harsh alpine environments. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively obscure and underappreciated in the botanical world. Its limited distribution and delicate nature make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike. Understanding and protecting this species is crucial for preserving biodiversity in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
