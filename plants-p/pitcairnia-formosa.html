                    <h1>Pitcairnia formosa</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia formosa, commonly known as the "queen of the bromeliads," is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant's vibrant, long-lasting flowers, which can range from red to orange, are borne on a tall inflorescence. Its leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia formosa is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
