                    <h1>Picea hondoensis</h1>
<p>Picea hondoensis, commonly known as the Hondo spruce, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the island of Hondo in the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of up to 20 meters, with a conical shape and dense, dark green foliage. The needles are flat, shiny, and arranged in spirals along the branches, while the cones are small and woody, maturing to a reddish-brown color. This species thrives in cool, moist montane forests and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Picea hondoensis is considered vulnerable and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
