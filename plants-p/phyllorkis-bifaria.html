<p>Phyllorkis bifaria, commonly known as the two-leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, intricately patterned flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has a short, stocky stem with two leaves, from which the name "bifaria" is derived. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
