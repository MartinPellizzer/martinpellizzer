<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant has a low, spreading growth habit with silver-gray foliage adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with tubular centers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Pseudoblepharis insignis is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
