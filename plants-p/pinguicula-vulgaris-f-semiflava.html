                    <h1>Pinguicula vulgaris f. semiflava</h1>
<p>Pinguicula vulgaris f. semiflava, commonly known as the semi-flowered butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap small insects. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are less showy compared to the typical form of Pinguicula vulgaris. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in bogs or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its semi-flavescens form refers to the pale or yellowish coloration of its flowers, distinguishing it from the more vibrant varieties.</p>
