                    <h1>Phleum pratense var. armatum</h1>
<p>Phleum pratense var. armatum, commonly known as hairy meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, with each spikelet bearing small, two-lobed flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
