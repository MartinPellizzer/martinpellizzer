<p>Polystichum walkerae, commonly known as the Walker's sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while supporting the growth of its fronds.</p>
<p>Polystichum walkerae is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
