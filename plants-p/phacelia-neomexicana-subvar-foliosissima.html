                    <h1>Phacelia neomexicana subvar. foliosissima</h1>
<p>Phacelia neomexicana subvar. foliosissima, commonly known as the Mexican phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators and its use in native plant gardens.</p>
