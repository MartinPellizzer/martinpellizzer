<p>Paspalum umbratile, commonly known as the shade paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate low light conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion.</p>
