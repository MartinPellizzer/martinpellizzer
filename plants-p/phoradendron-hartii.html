                    <h1>Phoradendron hartii</h1>
<p>Phoradendron hartii, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it produces its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant's berries are often used in traditional medicine and are also a food source for birds, which help in seed dispersal. Its sticky seeds adhere to the bark of host trees, enabling propagation.</p>
<p>Phoradendron hartii plays a significant ecological role in its habitat by influencing host tree growth and supporting local wildlife.</p>
