                    <h1>Pilea alpestris</h1>
<p>Pilea alpestris, commonly known as the alpine pilea, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery or grayish pubescence, which helps reflect excess sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces inconspicuous, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
<p>Its compact size and hardy nature make it well-suited for cultivation in temperate climates.</p>
