<p>Phippsia himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan phippsia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cold and arid conditions. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
