                    <h1>Polypodium auriculatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium auriculatum, commonly known as the ear-shaped fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are often shaped like ears, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Polypodium auriculatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in warm, humid conditions.</p>
