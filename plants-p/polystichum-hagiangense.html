                    <h1>Polystichum hagiangense</h1>
<p>Polystichum hagiangense, commonly known as the Hagiang fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of northern Vietnam.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Polystichum hagiangense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
