                    <h1>Polypodium griseum</h1>
<p>Polypodium griseum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, wiry fronds that often grow in dense clusters on rocky or shaded surfaces. The plant thrives in humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its spores are produced in small, round structures called sorangia, which are typically found on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium griseum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions.</p>
