<p>Phyllactis dinorrhiza, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which allow for gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant's leaves are alternate and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, reddish berries that are dispersed by water and birds.</p>
<p>Phyllactis dinorrhiza plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion.</p>
