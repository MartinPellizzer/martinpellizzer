                    <h1>Primula caldaria var. nana</h1>
<p>Primula caldaria var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf mountain primrose, is a compact, low-growing perennial that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It features hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Native to the high alpine regions of Europe, this variety is well adapted to harsh, rocky soils and strong winds. It blooms in early spring, making it a valuable early-season nectar source for pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
