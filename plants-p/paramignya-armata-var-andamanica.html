                    <h1>Paramignya armata var. andamanica</h1>
<p>Paramignya armata var. andamanica, commonly known as the Andaman mountain fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Andaman Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits. It is often found growing in dense undergrowth along forest edges and in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
