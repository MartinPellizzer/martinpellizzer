                    <h1>Pentameris propinqua</h1>
<p>Pentameris propinqua, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically arranged in umbels. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Pentameris propinqua plays a role in supporting pollinators, though it is less commonly cultivated than other milkweed species.</p>
