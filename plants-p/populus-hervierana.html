                    <h1>Populus hervierana</h1>
<p>Populus hervierana, commonly known as the Hervier's poplar, is a rare and ancient species of poplar native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing some resistance to harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Populus hervierana is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
