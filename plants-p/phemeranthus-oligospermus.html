<p>Phemeranthus oligospermus, commonly known as the fleeting flower, is a rare and short-lived plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that open only for a brief period, typically at night. The plant has a very short lifespan, often dying within a few days after flowering. It grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and is often found in areas with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its ephemeral nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
