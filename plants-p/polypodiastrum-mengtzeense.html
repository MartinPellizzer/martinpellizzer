                    <h1>Polypodiastrum mengtzeense</h1>
<p>Polypodiastrum mengtzeense, commonly known as Mengtze's polypody, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rocks or in moist, forested areas. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
