                    <h1>Phoradendron calyculatum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron calyculatum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Quercus*.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers followed by fleshy, pink or red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its parasitic nature allows it to thrive in a wide range of environments, often forming dense clusters on tree branches.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic lifestyle, Phoradendron calyculatum plays a role in supporting bird populations by providing a food source.</p>
