<p>Platanthera × enigma, commonly known as the enigmatic lady's tresses, is a hybrid orchid species native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and a striking, fragrant inflorescence composed of numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, where it thrives in rich, organic soil. Its hybrid origin results from crosses between Platanthera filiformis and Platanthera psycodes, leading to unique morphological traits.</p>
<p>The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological and genetic significance.</p>
