<p>Phlegmariurus mirabilis, commonly known as the fairy moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dense, and often cushion-like growth form, typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a thalloid structure with a leafless stem and a dense covering of leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>This moss is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
