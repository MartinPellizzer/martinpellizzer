<p>Phegopteris stegnogramme, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that are typically broad and undulating. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself to submerged or floating surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen.</p>
