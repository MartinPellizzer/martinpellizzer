<p>Polystichum melanochlamys, commonly known as the black-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are often adorned with a dense covering of small, glandular hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, supporting the growth of its compound, bipinnate fronds.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
