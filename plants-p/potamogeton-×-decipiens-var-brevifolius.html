                    <h1>Potamogeton × decipiens var. brevifolius</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × decipiens var. brevifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams, where it thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikelets, and it is often submerged, with only the upper parts emerging slightly above the water surface. Its leaves are usually arranged spirally along the stem and have a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is known for its adaptability and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
