<p>Pariti wrayae, commonly known as the Wray's pariti, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure, typical of bromeliads. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of red or orange.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pariti wrayae is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
