<p>Paepalanthus humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt's pincushion cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a spherical or cylindrical shape, resembling a pincushion. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiky structure. It is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, dry conditions with well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by cactus enthusiasts.</p>
