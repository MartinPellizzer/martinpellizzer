The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sunny environments.</p>
<p>Paspalum mollendense is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
