                    <h1>Poa catharinae</h1>
<p>Poa catharinae, commonly known as the Catherine's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typical of the Poaceae family, with elongated, awned lemmas. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range.</p>
