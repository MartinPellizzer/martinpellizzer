                <h1>Pocockia ovalis</h1>
<p>Pocockia ovalis, commonly known as the oval leaved fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of lanceolate, glossy green leaves that are typically arranged in a tight, upright cluster. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori. Pocockia ovalis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
