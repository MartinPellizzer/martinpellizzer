                    <h1>Pityrogramma flexilis</h1>
<p>Pityrogramma flexilis, commonly known as the flexible water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Pityrogramma flexilis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
