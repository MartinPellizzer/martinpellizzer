<p>Peperomia peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian pepper plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically oval or heart-shaped, often with a reddish or purplish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by tiny, berry-like fruits. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Peperomia peruviana is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types.</p>
