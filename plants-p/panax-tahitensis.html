<p>Panax tahitensis, commonly known as the Tahitian ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, yellowish roots that are highly valued for their medicinal properties. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments on rocky or limestone soils. Its leaves are palmate, with five to seven lobes, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by orange-red berries.</p>
