                    <h1>Petrodoxa</h1>
<p>Petrodoxa, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid regions.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. Its stems are often covered in a waxy coating, which further aids in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Petrodoxa is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky outcrops and dry meadows.</p>
