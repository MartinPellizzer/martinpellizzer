<p>Pinus ayacahuite subsp.</p>
<p>veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's Mexican pine, is a rare and critically endangered subspecies native to a small region in central Mexico. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its long, slender needles and distinctive, often twisted cones.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, temperate climate with moderate rainfall. Due to habitat loss and limited natural propagation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and role in the local ecosystem.</p>
