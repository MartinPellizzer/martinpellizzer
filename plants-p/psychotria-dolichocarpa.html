<p>Psychotria dolichocarpa, commonly known as the "arrow poison plant," is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It contains various alkaloids, including the potent neurotoxin tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which has been historically used by indigenous peoples for hunting.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a dangerous plant and is often avoided in ecological studies unless handled with care.</p>
