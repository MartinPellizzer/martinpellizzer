<p>Poa pratensis subsp.</p>
<p>dolichophylla, commonly known as the long-leaf meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are often more than twice the length of the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This subspecies typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
