<p>Pityrogramma pallida, commonly known as the pale water fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pityrogrammaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually pale green to silvery in color, which helps reflect excess light and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Pityrogramma pallida is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in containers or as a ground cover in humid gardens.</p>
