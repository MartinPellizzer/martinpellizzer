                    <h1>Psyllophora sieberiana</h1>
<p>Psyllophora sieberiana, commonly known as the Sieber's psyllid, is a small insect belonging to the family Psyllidae, often referred to as scale insects.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe and parts of Asia. The plant it feeds on is typically a member of the genus Cotoneaster, where it colonizes the stems and leaves. Its life cycle involves laying eggs on the plant surface, from which nymphs emerge and begin feeding on plant sap.</p>
<p>This feeding can cause deformation of the host plant's growth, making it a potential pest in certain horticultural settings.</p>
