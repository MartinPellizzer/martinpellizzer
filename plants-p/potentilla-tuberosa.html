<p>Potentilla tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has smooth, often hairy leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, and it produces tuberous roots that store nutrients. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and alpine settings.</p>
