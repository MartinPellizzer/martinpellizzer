                    <h1>Poa oraria</h1>
<p>Poa oraria, commonly known as the sand bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to coastal areas of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sandy soils, making it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Poa oraria is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
