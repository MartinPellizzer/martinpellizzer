                    <h1>Poilannammia allomorphioidea</h1>
<p>Poilannammia allomorphioidea, commonly known as the silverleaf moonflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that reflect sunlight, helping it conserve moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from shallow soil layers, and it thrives in cool, shaded conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation reserves.</p>
