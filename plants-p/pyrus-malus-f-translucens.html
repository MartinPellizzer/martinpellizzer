                    <h1>Pyrus malus f. translucens</h1>
<p>Pyrus malus f. translucens, commonly known as the translucent apple.</p>
<p>This unique cultivar is characterized by its distinctive translucent or opalescent leaves, which exhibit a glassy appearance due to a specialized cell structure. The leaves often display a striking contrast between the clear, waxy surface and the underlying green tissue. While it is not widely cultivated for fruit production, it is highly valued in botanical gardens for its ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>The plant retains the typical growth habits of the apple tree, with a compact form and a preference for well-drained, fertile soils.</p>
