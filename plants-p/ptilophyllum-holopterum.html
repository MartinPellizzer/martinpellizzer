<p>Ptilophyllum holopterum, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, resembling a small, four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, contributing to water filtration and habitat creation for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Ptilophyllum holopterum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
