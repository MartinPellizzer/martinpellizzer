                    <h1>Petrogeton patens</h1>
<p>Petrogeton patens, commonly known as the rock dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nourishment.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a vine-like structure that allows it to attach to host plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across rocky and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
