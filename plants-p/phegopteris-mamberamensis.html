                    <h1>Phegopteris mamberamensis</h1>
<p>Phegopteris mamberamensis, commonly known as the Mamberam fern, is a rare and endemic species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Phegopteris mamberamensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
