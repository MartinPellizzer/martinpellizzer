                    <h1>Parodia koehresiana</h1>
<p>Parodia koehresiana, commonly known as the "Pincushion Cactus," is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white to pale blue spines, giving it a pincushion-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short pedicels near the top of the plant. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
