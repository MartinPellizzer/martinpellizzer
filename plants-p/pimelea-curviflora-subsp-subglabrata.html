<p>Pimelea curviflora subsp.</p>
<p>subglabrata, commonly known as the smooth-leaved gold flower, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils, often in heathlands and open forests.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow to golden-orange flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking contrast to its grey-green foliage. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which gives it the subspecies name "subglabrata.".</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest.</p>
