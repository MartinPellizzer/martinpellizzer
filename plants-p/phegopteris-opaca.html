                    <h1>Phegopteris opaca</h1>
<p>Phegopteris opaca, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and colonize rocky or shaded areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Phegopteris opaca thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories or on rock surfaces.</p>
