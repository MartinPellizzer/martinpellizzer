                    <h1>Paepalanthus coutoensis</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus coutoensis, commonly known as the Cotoense Puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the high-altitude grasslands of southern Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears numerous small, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red and yellow. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andean p√°ramo ecosystem. Its rosette of sword-shaped leaves forms a water-holding structure, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
