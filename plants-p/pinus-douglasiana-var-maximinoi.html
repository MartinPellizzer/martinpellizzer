                    <h1>Pinus douglasiana var. maximinoi</h1>
<p>Pinus douglasiana var. maximinoi, commonly known as the Mexican red fir, is a rare and endemic coniferous tree native to the high-altitude regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The needles are long, flat, and often have a bluish-green hue, while the cones are typically reddish and persist on the branches for several years. This variant is adapted to cool, moist climates and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
