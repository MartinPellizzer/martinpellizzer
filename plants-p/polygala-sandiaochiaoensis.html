<p>Polygala sandiaochiaoensis, commonly known as the sandiaochiao polygala, is a rare flowering plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, sparsely branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a unique structure that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
