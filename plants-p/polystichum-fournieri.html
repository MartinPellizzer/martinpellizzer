<p>Polystichum fournieri, commonly known as the Fournier's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright clump. The fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving the plant a finely textured appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
