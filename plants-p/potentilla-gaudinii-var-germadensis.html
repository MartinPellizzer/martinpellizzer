                    <h1>Potentilla gaudinii var. germadensis</h1>
<p>Potentilla gaudinii var. germadensis, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features wiry, ascending stems covered with glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered with fine, glandular trichomes, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in high-altitude environments.</p>
