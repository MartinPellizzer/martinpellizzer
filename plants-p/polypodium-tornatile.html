                    <h1>Polypodium tornatile</h1>
<p>Polypodium tornatile, commonly known as the wandering fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint glow in the dark, a unique trait among ferns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome system allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle.</p>
