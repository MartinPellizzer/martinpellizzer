                    <h1>Polygonatum macrophyllum</h1>
<p>Polygonatum macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf Solomon's seal, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features tall, upright stems that bear broad, lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late spring, which are followed by red berries in the autumn. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in woodland environments.</p>
<p>Polygonatum macrophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens.</p>
