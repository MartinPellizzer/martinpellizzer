                    <h1>Psammisia urichiana</h1>
<p>Psammisia urichiana, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent-like structure, with hairy stems and lobed leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pale, cotton-like seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in harsh environments.</p>
