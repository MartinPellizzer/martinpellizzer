                    <h1>Phymatopsis intermedia</h1>
<p>Phymatopsis intermedia, commonly known as the Texas milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>Texas milkweed plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees.</p>
