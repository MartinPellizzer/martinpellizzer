                    <h1>Plantago krascheninnikovii</h1>
<p>Plantago krascheninnikovii, commonly known as the Arctic plantain, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters during the short growing season. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in extreme conditions makes it an important component of Arctic ecosystems.</p>
