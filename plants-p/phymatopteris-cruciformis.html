<p>Phymatopteris cruciformis, commonly known as the cross fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, cross-shaped fronds that are typically divided into four parts. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The cross fern is an important component of its ecosystem, providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
