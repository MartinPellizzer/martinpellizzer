                    <h1>Paspalum graniticum</h1>
<p>Paspalum graniticum, commonly known as the granite paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is well adapted to poor soils and can tolerate high levels of salinity and drought. Its dense growth pattern makes it useful for erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
<p>Paspalum graniticum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
