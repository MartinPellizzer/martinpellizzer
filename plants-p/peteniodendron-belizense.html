<p>Peteniodendron belizense, commonly known as the Belize mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the lowland rainforests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and showy yellow flowers. The tree produces small, red fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fibrous aril. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which has been historically used in furniture and cabinetry.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species.</p>
