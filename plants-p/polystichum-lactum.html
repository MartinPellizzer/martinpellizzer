<p>Polystichum lactum, commonly known as the milk fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bioluminescent spore cases, which emit a faint glow in the dark. The plant has feather-like fronds that are divided into smaller, lance-shaped segments. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in forest understories.</p>
<p>The spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
