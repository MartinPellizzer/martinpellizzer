                    <h1>Phoradendron fragile</h1>
<p>Phoradendron fragile, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted for this parasitic lifestyle. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often used in holiday traditions. It is found in various regions of the Americas and is known for its ecological role in supporting bird populations.</p>
<p>Its presence can weaken the host tree over time, making it both a fascinating and sometimes problematic species.</p>
