<p>Ptychophyllum dichotomum, commonly known as the dichotomous bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, dichotomously branched stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches. It has no true leaves, instead relying on its specialized bladders for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Ptychophyllum dichotomum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web through its prey capture mechanism.</p>
