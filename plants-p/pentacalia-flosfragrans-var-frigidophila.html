                    <h1>Pentacalia flosfragrans var. frigidophila</h1>
<p>Pentacalia flosfragrans var. frigidophila, commonly known as the cold-loving pentacalia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions with cool climates.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sun exposure. Its unique adaptation to cold environments makes it a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
