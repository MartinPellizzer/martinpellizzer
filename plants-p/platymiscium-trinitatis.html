<p>Platymiscium trinitatis, commonly known as the Trinidad mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed.
