<p>Polypodium lehmannii var. mairei, commonly known as the Maire's shield fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental qualities.</p>
