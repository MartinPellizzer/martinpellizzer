                    <h1>Pinus jeffreyi var. peninsularis</h1>
<p>Pinus jeffreyi var. peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular Jeffrey pine, is a variant of the Jeffrey pine native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a tall, slender evergreen conifer with long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are often retained on the branches for many years, a feature known as serotiny. It thrives in coastal habitats with mild, wet winters and dry summers.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
