<p>Pancheria xaragurensis, commonly known as the Xaragure wild orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late winter or early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its flowers are usually pale pink or white, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with darker pigmentation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pancheria xaragurensis is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
