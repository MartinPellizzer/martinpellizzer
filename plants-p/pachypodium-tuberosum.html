                    <h1>Pachypodium tuberosum</h1>
<p>Pachypodium tuberosum, commonly known as the tuberous pachypodium, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the dry season, which are often followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Pachypodium tuberosum is well-suited for xerophytic gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
