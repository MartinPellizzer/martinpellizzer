                    <h1>Polylophium petrophilum</h1>
<p>Polylophium petrophilum, commonly known as the rock-loving fern, is a rare and specialized plant species that thrives in rocky, acidic soils.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions where it can anchor itself in crevices and receive adequate moisture. Its unique morphology allows it to efficiently absorb nutrients from limited soil sources.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Polylophium petrophilum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
