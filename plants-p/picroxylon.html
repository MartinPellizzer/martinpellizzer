                    <h1>Picroxylon</h1>
<p>Picroxylon, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, thick, waxy leaves, and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces hard, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its natural range.</p>
