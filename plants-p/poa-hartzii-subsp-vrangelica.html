<p>Poa hartzii subsp.</p>
<p>vrangelica, commonly known as the Vrangelskaya bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat.</p>
