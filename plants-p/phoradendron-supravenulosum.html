                    <h1>Phoradendron supravenulosum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron supravenulosum, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Neotropics, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. It is found primarily in Central and South America, growing in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important part of the ecosystem, supporting various wildlife species.</p>
