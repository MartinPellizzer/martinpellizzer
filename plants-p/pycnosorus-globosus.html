                    <h1>Pycnosorus globosus</h1>
<p>Pycnosorus globosus, commonly known as the globe lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms dense, cushion-like growths on rock surfaces.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange thallus, which is rich in photosynthetic pigments. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on symbiotic algae for nutrition. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
