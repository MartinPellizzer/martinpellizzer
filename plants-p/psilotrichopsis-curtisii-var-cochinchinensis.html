                    <h1>Psilotrichopsis curtisii var. cochinchinensis</h1>
<p>Psilotrichopsis curtisii var. cochinchinensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that lack true vascular tissues. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It has a limited geographic distribution, primarily found in Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and parts of China.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status remains poorly understood.</p>
