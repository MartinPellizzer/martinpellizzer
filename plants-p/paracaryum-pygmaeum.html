<p>Paracaryum pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Native to southern Africa, this plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures include a large, cone-like structure that produces both male and female spores.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
