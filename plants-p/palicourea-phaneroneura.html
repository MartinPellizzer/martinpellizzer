                    <h1>Palicourea phaneroneura</h1>
<p>Palicourea phaneroneura, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. Its fruits are small berries that turn red when mature, containing seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it attaches to host trees and derives some of its nutrients from them.</p>
