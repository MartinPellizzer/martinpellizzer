<p>Porsildia groenlandica subsp.</p>
<p>glabra, commonly known as the Greenland sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments.</p>
<p>The plant has small, typically green or bluish-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
