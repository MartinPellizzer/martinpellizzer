                    <h1>Psychrogeton mollissimus</h1>
<p>Psychrogeton mollissimus, commonly known as the soft-leaved psychrogeton, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in its cold, arid environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, adapted for pollination by insects. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem.</p>
