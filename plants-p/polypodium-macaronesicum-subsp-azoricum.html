<p>Polypodium macaronesicum subsp.</p>
<p>azoricum, commonly known as the Azorean cliff fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found exclusively in the Azores. It thrives in rocky, coastal environments, often growing on limestone outcrops and cliff faces.</p>
<p>The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with dark green, leathery fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region.</p>
