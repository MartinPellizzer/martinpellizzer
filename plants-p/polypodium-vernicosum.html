<p>Polypodium vernicosum, commonly known as the common wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to various parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock faces, walls, and woodlands. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to grow on surfaces without soil makes it an important component of forest ecosystems.</p>
