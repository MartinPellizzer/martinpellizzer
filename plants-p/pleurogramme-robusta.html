<p>Pleurogramme robusta, commonly known as the robust pleurogramme, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has long, slender fronds that are often submerged or floating, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Pleurogramme robusta is valued in aquariums for its ornamental beauty and ability to thrive in controlled aquatic settings.</p>
