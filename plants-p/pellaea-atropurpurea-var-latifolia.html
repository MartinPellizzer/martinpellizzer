<p>Pellaea atropurpurea var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple to reddish stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry, sunny environments.</p>
