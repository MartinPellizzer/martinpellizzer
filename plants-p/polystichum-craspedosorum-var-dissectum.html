                    <h1>Polystichum craspedosorum var. dissectum</h1>
<p>Polystichum craspedosorum var. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that give it a delicate, almost lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
