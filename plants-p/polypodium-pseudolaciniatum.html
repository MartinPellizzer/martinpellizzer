<p>Polypodium pseudolaciniatum, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are divided into numerous small, serrated segments. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
