                    <h1>Podocoma hieraciifolia</h1>
<p>Podocoma hieraciifolia, commonly known as the mossy cushion plant, is a succulent species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that form a compact cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically during the cooler months. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Podocoma hieraciifolia is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species.</p>
