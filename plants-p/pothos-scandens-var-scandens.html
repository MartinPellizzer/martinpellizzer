                    <h1>Pothos scandens var. scandens</h1>
<p>Pothos scandens var. scandens, commonly known as the creeping pothos, is a vigorous climbing vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically light to dark green, with a slightly variegated pattern in some cultivars. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is primarily grown for its foliage rather than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and is highly adaptable to various indoor environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to climb and trail makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets and shelf displays.</p>
