<p>Pinus wallichiana subsp.</p>
<p>parva, commonly known as the dwarf Himalayan pine, is a small evergreen conifer native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, twisted branches and needle-like leaves that are typically 2â€“4 cm long.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years, releasing seeds in the fall. It thrives in cold, dry climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
