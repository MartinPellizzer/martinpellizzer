                    <h1>Panax vinosus</h1>
<p>Panax vinosus, commonly known as the purple ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China and Korea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive purple stems and dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed. Its roots are valued in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits, though they are less well-known than those of Panax ginseng.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Panax vinosus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
