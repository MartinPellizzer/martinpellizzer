                    <h1>Poa densa var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Poa densa var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and compact, tufted foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. One of its notable features is its ability to produce viviparous shoots, which can develop into new plants while still attached to the parent.</p>
<p>This trait makes it an interesting subject for studying vegetative reproduction in grasses.</p>
