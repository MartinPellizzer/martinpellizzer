                    <h1>Pierardia flaccida</h1>
<p>Pierardia flaccida, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, perennial herb with a rosette of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that store water, an adaptation to its dry habitat. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. Its succulent leaves and drought-resistant nature make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
