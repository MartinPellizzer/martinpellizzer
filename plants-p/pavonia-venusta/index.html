                            <h1>Pavonia Venusta</h1>
<p>Pavonia venusta is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant known for its vibrant red blooms and lush green foliage. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in coastal and sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. This plant is often referred to as the "beach hibiscus" due to its ability to withstand salty air and strong winds. Its showy flowers attract a variety of pollinators, making it a valuable addition to gardens and natural habitats. Despite its ornamental appeal, Pavonia venusta also plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
