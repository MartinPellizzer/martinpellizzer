<p>Primula lhasaensis, commonly known as the Lhasa primrose, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Tibet and Nepal.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of pink, white, or purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of down, which helps to retain moisture.</p>
<p>Primula lhasaensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment.</p>
