<p>Panicum bradypus, commonly known as the slow-growing panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces fluffy, seed-bearing spikes that are characteristic of the grass family. Its growth rate is notably slow, which contributes to its name and makes it a resilient species in challenging environments.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and supporting biodiversity.</p>
