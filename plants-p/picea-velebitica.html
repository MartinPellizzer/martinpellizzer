<p>Picea velebitica, commonly known as the Velebit fir, is a rare conifer native to the mountainous regions of Croatia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
