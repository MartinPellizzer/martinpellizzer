<p>Platystylis stipulacea, commonly known as the broad-styled mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and gelatinous berries. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, deriving water and nutrients through its haustoria. Its flowers are typically green or yellowish, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are important for bird dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species.</p>
