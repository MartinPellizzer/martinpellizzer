<p>Polypodium semipinnatum, commonly known as the rock fern or shield fern, is a species of polypody that is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its compact, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or in forest floors. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense mats, allowing it to colonize rocky or shaded areas effectively.</p>
<p>Polypodium semipinnatum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature.</p>
