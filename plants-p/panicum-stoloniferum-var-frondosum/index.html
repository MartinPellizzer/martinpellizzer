                            <h1>Panicum Stoloniferum Var. Frondosum</h1>
<p>Panicum stoloniferum var. frondosum is a striking ornamental grass known for its feathery plumes and graceful appearance. Native to regions with temperate climates, it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun exposure. This variety is prized for its ability to add texture and movement to garden landscapes throughout the growing season. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense clumps that are both drought tolerant and low maintenance. Whether used as a focal point or in mass plantings, this plant offers year-round visual interest and ecological benefits.</p>
