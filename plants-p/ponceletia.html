                    <h1>Ponceletia</h1>
<p>Ponceletia, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are native to Africa and parts of Asia. The plants are characterized by their succulent stems and leaves, which store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. They produce small, often clustered flowers that can be white, pink, or yellow in color.</p>
<p>The bark and leaves of Ponceletia species contain milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus.</p>
