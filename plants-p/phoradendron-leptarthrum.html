                    <h1>Phoradendron leptarthrum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron leptarthrum, commonly known as the lesser mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often inconspicuous, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that attract birds and other animals. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fruits, allowing the plant to spread to new hosts.</p>
<p>This species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
