<p>Pellacalyx yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan peacock flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy inflorescences that resemble peacock feathers, hence its common name. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in dense, branched panicles. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
