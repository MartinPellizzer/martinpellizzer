<p>Pinus greggii subsp.</p>
<p>australis, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone pine, is a subspecies native to the high-altitude regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its slow growth, long lifespan, and ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments.</p>
<p>The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and its cones are small and often covered in a sticky resin. It is adapted to rocky soils and can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its ecological resilience and potential for studying climate change impacts on plant life.</p>
