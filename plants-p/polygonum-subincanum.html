<p>Polygonum subincanum, commonly known as the silverleaf knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and streambanks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a common wildflower and a potential weed in certain habitats.</p>
