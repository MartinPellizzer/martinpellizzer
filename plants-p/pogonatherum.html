<p>Pogonatherum, commonly known as the beardgrass, is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in wetland or marshy habitats. Pogonatherum species are characterized by their dense, tufted growth and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. They produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers.</p>
<p>The genus is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
