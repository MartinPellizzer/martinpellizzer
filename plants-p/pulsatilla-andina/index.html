                            <h1>Pulsatilla Andina</h1>
<p>Andean pasqueflower, scientifically known as Pulsatilla andina, is a striking member of the Ranunculaceae family native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. This rare and delicate plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers surrounded by velvety, fuzzy bracts that resemble a crown. Thriving in cool, moist environments, it is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, the Andean pasqueflower is considered an endangered species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss. Its unique beauty and ecological importance make it a subject of both scientific study and conservation efforts.</p>
