                    <h1>Peridium ovale</h1>
<p>Peridium ovale, commonly known as the oval peridium, is a unique botanical structure found in certain fungal spore capsules.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its oval shape and smooth, often waxy surface, which aids in spore dispersal. The peridium ovale is typically composed of a thick, multilayered cell wall that provides structural integrity. It serves as a protective casing for the spores inside, shielding them from environmental stressors.</p>
<p>This structure is crucial for the reproductive cycle of the associated fungus.</p>
