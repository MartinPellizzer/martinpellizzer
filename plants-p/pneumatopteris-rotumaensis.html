<p>Pneumatopteris rotumaensis, commonly known as the Rotuma fern, is a rare fern species native to the island of Rotuma in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in coastal or lowland forest areas. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
