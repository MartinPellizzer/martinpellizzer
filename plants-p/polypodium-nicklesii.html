                    <h1>Polypodium nicklesii</h1>
<p>Polypodium nicklesii, commonly known as the Nickles' holly fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found in specific regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some areas.</p>
