<p>Psathyrostachys lanuginosa, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and potential for forage, it has been studied for agricultural and ecological applications.</p>
