                    <h1>Protea involucrata</h1>
<p>Protea involucrata, commonly known as the silver protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence composed of numerous white to pinkish flower heads surrounded by a cluster of modified leaves called bracts. The plant is native to the Western and Eastern Cape provinces, where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, which are attracted by the nectar.</p>
<p>The protea is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
