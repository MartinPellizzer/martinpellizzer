<p>Perfoliata villosa, commonly known as the hairy leaf perfoliate, is a flowering plant characterized by its hairy, often silvery foliage.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is native to arid and semi-arid regions. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates.
