                    <h1>Petrosedum pruinatum</h1>
<p>Petrosedum pruinatum, commonly known as the silver stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a versatile and drought-tolerant addition to many landscapes.</p>
