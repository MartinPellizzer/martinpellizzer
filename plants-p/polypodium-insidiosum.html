<p>Polypodium insidiosum, commonly known as the insidious polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are typically 10â€“30 cm long and have a finely toothed margin. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released as spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its rhizome is creeping and can form dense mats, contributing to its invasive potential in certain areas.</p>
