<p>Puccinellia distans subsp.</p>
<p>fontana, commonly known as Fontana's saltbush, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of coastal and desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its resilience to harsh environmental conditions contributes to its ecological significance in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
