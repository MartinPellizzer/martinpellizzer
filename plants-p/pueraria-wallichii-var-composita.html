<p>Pueraria wallichii var. composita, commonly known as the Chinese kudzu or broad-leaf kudzu, is a perennial vine native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust growth, with large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 20 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, pale purple flowers that bloom in summer, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its vigorous growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
