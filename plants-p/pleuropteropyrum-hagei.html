<p>It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including its small, clustered growth habit and specialized leaf structures adapted to its specific ecological niche. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests or along rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, with a complex arrangement of spore-bearing capsules that contribute to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
