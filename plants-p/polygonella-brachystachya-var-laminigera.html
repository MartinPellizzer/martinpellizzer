                    <h1>Polygonella brachystachya var. laminigera</h1>
<p>Polygonella brachystachya var. laminigera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mountain sandwort, is a low-growing, perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in compact, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh conditions, it is a characteristic component of high-elevation plant communities.</p>
