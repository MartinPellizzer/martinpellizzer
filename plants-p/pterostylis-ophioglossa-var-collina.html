                    <h1>Pterostylis ophioglossa var. collina</h1>
<p>Pterostylis ophioglossa var. collina, commonly known as the coastal spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid endemic to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that resemble spiders, a feature typical of the Pterostylis genus. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in coastal heathlands and is often found in areas with high humidity and mild temperatures. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and land-use alterations.</p>
