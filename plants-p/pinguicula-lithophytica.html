                    <h1>Pinguicula lithophytica</h1>
<p>Pinguicula lithophytica, commonly known as the rock butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming plant with hairy, succulent leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant's leaves are typically green or reddish in color, and they curl around prey to aid in digestion. Pinguicula lithophytica thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptation to nutrient-scarce environments makes it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
