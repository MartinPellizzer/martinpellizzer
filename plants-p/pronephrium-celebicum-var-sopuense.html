<p>Pronephrium celebicum var. sopuense, commonly known as the Celebes pronephrium, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the tropical regions of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbellate inflorescences, which are followed by red, fleshy berries containing numerous seeds. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and restricted distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its ecological role and conservation status remain poorly understood.</p>
