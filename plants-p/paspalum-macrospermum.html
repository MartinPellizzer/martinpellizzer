                    <h1>Paspalum macrospermum</h1>
<p>Paspalum macrospermum, commonly known as giant paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, narrow leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in wetland and marshy environments, often forming dense stands that stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable ecological plant and a potential invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
