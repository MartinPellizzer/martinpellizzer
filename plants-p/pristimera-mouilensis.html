                    <h1>Pristimera mouilensis</h1>
<p>Pristimera mouilensis, commonly known as the Mouil River fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble ferns. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments with high humidity and moderate light exposure. Its rhizomes anchor it to the substrate, while its leaves float on the water surface, facilitating photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pristimera mouilensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
