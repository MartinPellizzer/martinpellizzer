                    <h1>Phoradendron brachypodum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron brachypodum, commonly known as the shortpod mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Quercus*.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>This species is native to parts of Central and South America, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
