                    <h1>Potamogeton crispus var. serratus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton crispus var. serratus, commonly known as the serrated curly pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often curled and have serrated edges, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense spikes, and it thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain conditions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
