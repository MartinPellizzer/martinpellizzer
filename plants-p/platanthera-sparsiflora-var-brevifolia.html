                    <h1>Platanthera sparsiflora var. brevifolia</h1>
<p>Platanthera sparsiflora var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved coralroot, is a rare and elusive orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a spike, and its leaves are short and sparse, giving it its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its secretive nature, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
