                    <h1>Pachypodium</h1>
<p>Pachypodium, commonly known as the moon cactus or bottle tree, is a genus of succulent plants native to Madagascar and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. Their leaves are typically small and may be deciduous, reducing water loss. Pachypodium species often produce striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red.</p>
<p>They are popular in horticulture due to their unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
