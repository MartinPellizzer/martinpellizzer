<p>Polystichum webbianum, commonly known as the Webb's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments, giving the plant a distinctive, feathery appearance. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction.</p>
