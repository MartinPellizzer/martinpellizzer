                    <h1>Populus × bachelieri</h1>
<p>Populus × bachelieri, commonly known as the Weeping Poplar, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that give it a unique, almost weeping appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray, with a fibrous texture that becomes more pronounced as the tree matures.</p>
