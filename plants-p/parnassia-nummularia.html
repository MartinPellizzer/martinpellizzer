<p>Parnassia nummularia, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of thick, waxy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, rocky areas, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Parnassia nummularia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
