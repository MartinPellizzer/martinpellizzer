<p>Paragymnopteris bipinnata, commonly known as the two-pinnate cliff fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are divided into two levels of pinnae, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments, thriving in humid climates.</p>
<p>Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its natural habitat.</p>
