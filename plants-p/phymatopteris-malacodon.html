<p>Phymatopteris malacodon, commonly known as the Malacodon hawksbeard fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green to pale yellow in color. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread across moist, shaded habitats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in humid environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
