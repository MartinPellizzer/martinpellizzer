The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The showy pink to reddish flowers appear in late spring and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native environment.</p>
