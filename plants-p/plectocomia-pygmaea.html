                    <h1>Plectocomia pygmaea</h1>
<p>Plectocomia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf plectocomia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Plectocomia pygmaea is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
