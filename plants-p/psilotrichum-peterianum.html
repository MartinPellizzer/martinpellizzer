                    <h1>Psilotrichum peterianum</h1>
<p>Psilotrichum peterianum, commonly known as the Peter's spike moss, is a small, terrestrial fern that belongs to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, spike-like formations along the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forests or rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
