<p>Passerina pubescens var. virgata, commonly known as the silverleaf pasqueflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, which bloom in early spring. Its stems are erect and often branched, bearing the same silvery foliage.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
