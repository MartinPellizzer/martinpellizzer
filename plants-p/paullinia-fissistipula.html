<p>Paullinia fissistipula, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife.</p>
<p>Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its ecological impact as an invasive species in some regions is a concern.</p>
