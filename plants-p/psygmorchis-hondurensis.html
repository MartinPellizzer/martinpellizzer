                    <h1>Psygmorchis hondurensis</h1>
<p>Psygmorchis hondurensis, commonly known as the Honduras orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
