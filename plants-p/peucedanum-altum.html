                    <h1>Peucedanum altum</h1>
<p>Peucedanum altum, commonly known as greater cowparsley, is a tall biennial or perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its seeds are enclosed in small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which disperse easily by wind.</p>
<p>Peucedanum altum is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
