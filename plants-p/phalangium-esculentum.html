                    <h1>Phalangium esculentum</h1>
<p>Phalangium esculentum, commonly known as the edible centipede, is a species of centipede that is occasionally consumed in certain cultures.</p>
<p>It belongs to the order Scolopendridae and is characterized by its long, segmented body and numerous pairs of legs. The plant-like appearance of its body can sometimes lead to confusion with certain arthropods. While not a true plant, it is sometimes referred to in botanical discussions due to its habitat in moist, plant-rich environments.</p>
<p>Its role in the ecosystem is primarily as a predator of small invertebrates.</p>
