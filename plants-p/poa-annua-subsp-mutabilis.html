<p>Poa annua subsp.</p>
<p>mutabilis, commonly known as the variable bluegrass, is a cool-season grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a bluish-green color, often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The plant exhibits morphological variability, with differences in leaf width, tillering, and flowering structures depending on environmental conditions. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences and is wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is both a desirable turfgrass and a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
