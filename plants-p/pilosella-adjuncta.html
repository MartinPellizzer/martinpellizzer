                    <h1>Pilosella adjuncta</h1>
<p>Pilosella adjuncta, commonly known as the alpine mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically forms compact rosettes and has a fibrous root system adapted to rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Pilosella adjuncta is often found in open, sunny habitats at high elevations.</p>
