                    <h1>Pollia didyma</h1>
<p>Pollia didyma, commonly known as the two-colored silk-cotton tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a capsule, a feature that aids in its dispersal. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Pollia didyma is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional crafts and medicine in some regions.</p>
