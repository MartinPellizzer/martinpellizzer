<p>Polypodium marginellum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, making it a common sight in forested areas. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
