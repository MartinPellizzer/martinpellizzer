<p>Pseudoanastatica dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched false sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous annual plant characterized by its dichotomous branching pattern, where each stem splits into two equal branches. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically narrow and linear. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions through its deep root system and succulent stems.</p>
<p>Pseudoanastatica dichotoma is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
