                    <h1>Pterocarpus abyssinicus</h1>
<p>Pterocarpus abyssinicus, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to Ethiopia and parts of East Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark brown bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, dark seeds. Its heartwood is highly valued for its rich, reddish-brown color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in furniture and musical instrument crafting.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.</p>
