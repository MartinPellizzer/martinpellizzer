<p>Panicum truncatum, commonly known as cutgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clump-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and roadside ditches, and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
