<p>Pseudophegopteris pyrrhorhachis subsp.</p>
<p>distans, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cliff fern, is a rare and specialized fern species found in specific mountainous regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in crevices. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it reproduces primarily through sporophytic development.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
