<p>Pleurogramme linearifolia, commonly known as the linear-leaf pleurogramme, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves that form dense, floating mats on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Pleurogramme linearifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
