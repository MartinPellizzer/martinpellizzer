<p>Potamogeton × fluitans var. spathulatus, commonly known as the broadleaf pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, flat, ribbon-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant grows in shallow to moderately deep freshwater environments, such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a common and sometimes invasive species in waterways.</p>
