                    <h1>Pulicaria undulata f. villosissima</h1>
<p>Pulicaria undulata f. villosissima, commonly known as the woolly sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
