                    <h1>Prasiteles</h1>
<p>Prasiteles, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a unique plant that exhibits parasitic behavior, deriving nutrients from host plants.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, which means it cannot perform photosynthesis. The plant typically attaches itself to the roots of other plants, often in forest environments. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a specialized structure for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a specific role in ecological systems, though it can be detrimental to its host.</p>
