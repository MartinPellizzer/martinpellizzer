                    <h1>Pellaea nana</h1>
<p>Pellaea nana, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small, compact fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into delicate, lance-shaped leaves. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Pellaea nana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light.</p>
