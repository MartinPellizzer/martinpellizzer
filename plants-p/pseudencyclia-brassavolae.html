<p>Pseudencyclia brassavolae, commonly known as the Cape York cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish male cones and large, spiny female cones, which are typically found on separate plants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
