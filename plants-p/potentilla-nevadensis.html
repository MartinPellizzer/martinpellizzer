<p>Potentilla nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra snowbank, is a low-growing shrub native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.</p>
<p>It is adapted to cold, alpine environments and typically thrives in rocky soils and open slopes. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Potentilla nevadensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife.</p>
