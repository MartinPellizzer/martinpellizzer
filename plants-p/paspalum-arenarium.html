<p>Paspalum arenarium, commonly known as sand paspalum, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought and saline conditions.</p>
<p>Paspalum arenarium is often found in coastal dunes and inland sand plains, playing a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
