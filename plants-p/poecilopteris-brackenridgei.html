                    <h1>Poecilopteris brackenridgei</h1>
<p>Poecilopteris brackenridgei, commonly known as the Brackenridge's cliff fern, is a fossilized plant from the Late Cretaceous period.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its complex frond structure with a distinct pinnae arrangement. The plant exhibits features typical of ancient ferns, including a rhizome and sporangia clusters. Its fossilized remains are often found in sedimentary rocks in North America.</p>
<p>This species provides valuable insights into the paleobotanical diversity of prehistoric ecosystems.</p>
