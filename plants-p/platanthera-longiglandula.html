                    <h1>Platanthera longiglandula</h1>
<p>Platanthera longiglandula, commonly known as the long-glandular twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to North America.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant with a slender, leafless stem that typically grows to a height of about 10â€“20 cm. The plant produces striking, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, often with a distinct, spurred lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a rare and threatened species in many regions.</p>
