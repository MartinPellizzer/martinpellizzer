                    <h1>Pteris silvatica</h1>
<p>Pteris silvatica, commonly known as the forest water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a soft blue glow in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizome system allows it to spread rapidly through the forest floor, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Pteris silvatica plays a vital role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small forest organisms.</p>
