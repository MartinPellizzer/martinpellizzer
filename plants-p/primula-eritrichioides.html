                    <h1>Primula eritrichioides</h1>
<p>Primula eritrichioides, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with rosettes of fleshy, basal leaves that help it survive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens with alpine or rock garden settings.</p>
