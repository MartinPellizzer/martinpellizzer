                    <h1>Pleonotoma flavida</h1>
<p>Pleonotoma flavida, commonly known as the yellow-banded flat bark scale, is a small, sedentary insect that belongs to the family Diaspididae.</p>
<p>It is primarily found on the stems and branches of various woody plants, where it feeds on plant sap using its specialized piercing-sucking mouthparts. The adult females are typically covered in a waxy, protective coating that helps them retain moisture and avoid predation. This species is known for its bright yellow body coloration, which serves as a warning signal to potential predators.</p>
<p>Due to its cryptic nature and limited mobility, it plays a minor role in the ecological dynamics of its host plants.</p>
