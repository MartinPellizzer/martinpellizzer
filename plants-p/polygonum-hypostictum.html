<p>Polygonum hypostictum, commonly known as the Chinese knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features rhizomatous growth and can form dense colonies, making it a common invasive species in wetlands and disturbed soils. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple-tinged, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist environments and is often found along riverbanks and in marshy areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through underground stems contribute to its ecological impact.</p>
