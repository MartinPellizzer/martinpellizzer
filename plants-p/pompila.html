                    <h1>Pompila</h1>
<p>Pompila, commonly known as the common wasp, is a type of wasp that belongs to the family Vespidae.</p>
<p>It is a solitary wasp, meaning it does not live in colonies like social wasps. The plant name "Pompila" is actually a misnomer, as it refers to the wasp rather than a botanical species. The confusion may arise from the similarity in name between the wasp and certain flowering plants.</p>
<p>In botany, the term "Pompila" is not used to describe any known plant species.</p>
