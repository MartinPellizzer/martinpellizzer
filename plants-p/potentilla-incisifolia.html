                    <h1>Potentilla incisifolia</h1>
<p>Potentilla incisifolia, commonly known as the cut-leaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates.</p>
