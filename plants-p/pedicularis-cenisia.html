                    <h1>Pedicularis cenisia</h1>
<p>Pedicularis cenisia, commonly known as the white fairy slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like flower that resembles a slipper, with a white or pale pink coloration. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pedicularis cenisia is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
