<p>Panicum cynodon, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, reddish-colored blades that often have a bluish tint. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common weed in agricultural fields and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, Panicum cynodon is often considered a problematic invasive species in certain regions.</p>
