<p>oederi, commonly known as the Oeder's lousewort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>The plant features showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is often found in rocky or meadow environments at high elevations.</p>
