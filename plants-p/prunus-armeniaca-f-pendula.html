                    <h1>Prunus armeniaca f. pendula</h1>
<p>Prunus armeniaca f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping cherry or weeping peach, is a cultivar of the peach tree characterized by its graceful, cascading branches.</p>
<p>It features showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of pink or white. The plant produces small, edible fruits similar to those of the common peach, though they are often less abundant than in other varieties. Its ornamental value lies in its elegant, drooping form, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green and provide a striking contrast to the blossoms and fruit.</p>
