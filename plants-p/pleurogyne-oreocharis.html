                    <h1>Pleurogyne oreocharis</h1>
<p>Pleurogyne oreocharis, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the south-western region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, sandy soils, often in heathland or coastal areas. The plant is characterized by its showy, golden-yellow inflorescences that resemble misty clouds, hence its common name. Its flowers are arranged in dense, terminal clusters and are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pleurogyne oreocharis is considered vulnerable and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
