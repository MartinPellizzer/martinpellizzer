<p>Pyrus nivalis f. pallidifolia, commonly known as the Whiteleaf Pear, is a unique horticultural form of the White Pear.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its pale, almost white leaves that contrast with its typical green foliage, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters. The leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruit that is similar to the common pear but often smaller and less sweet.</p>
