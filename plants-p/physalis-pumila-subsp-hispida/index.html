                            <h1>Physalis Pumila Subsp. Hispida</h1>
<p>Physalis pumila subsp. hispida is a lesser-known member of the nightshade family known for its unique appearance and ecological significance. This low-growing plant is often found in disturbed soils and rocky habitats across temperate regions. Its small, hairy fruits encase a cluster of bright orange seeds, making it visually striking yet easy to overlook. Despite its modest size, it plays a vital role in supporting local insect and bird populations. Understanding this species helps highlight the diversity within the Physalis genus and the importance of preserving such plants in natural ecosystems.</p>
