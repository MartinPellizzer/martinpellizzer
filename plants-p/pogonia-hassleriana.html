<p>Pogonia hassleriana, commonly known as the pink fairy-orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking pink and white floral structure, which resembles a fairy's costume, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as hardwood forests and swampy areas. It has a short, underground rhizome and produces a single, showy flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
