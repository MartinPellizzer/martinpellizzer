                    <h1>Phegopteris sturmii</h1>
<p>Phegopteris sturmii, commonly known as the Sturm's water fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature in the fern family.</p>
<p>Phegopteris sturmii plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem.</p>
