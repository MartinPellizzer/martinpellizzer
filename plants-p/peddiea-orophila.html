<p>Peddiea orophila, commonly known as the mountain peddiea, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Peddiea orophila is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
