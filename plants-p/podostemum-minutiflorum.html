                    <h1>Podostemum minutiflorum</h1>
<p>Podostemum minutiflorum, commonly known as the dwarf flowered water plant, is a rare aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and its unique adaptation to growing in fast-flowing freshwater environments. The plant typically attaches itself to rocks or submerged vegetation using its specialized roots. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, and it produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom close to the water's surface.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often found in clear, nutrient-rich streams.</p>
