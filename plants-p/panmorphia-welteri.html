                    <h1>Panmorphia welteri</h1>
<p>Panmorphia welteri, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, orchid-like flowers and its unique ability to thrive without soil, relying instead on the roots of trees for nutrients. The plant's leaves are typically slender and elongated, adapted for capturing moisture from the humid air. Its blooming period is short-lived, often occurring only once every few years, making it a sought-after specimen among botanists and plant enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Panmorphia welteri is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
