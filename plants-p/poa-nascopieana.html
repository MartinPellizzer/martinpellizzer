                    <h1>Poa nascopieana</h1>
<p>Poa nascopieana, commonly known as the Nascopie grass, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the Nascopie region of New York.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass with slender, tufted culms and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Poa nascopieana is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health in its native environment.</p>
