<p>Peliosanthes arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal Himalayan cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being particularly large and woody. It thrives in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, typically between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
