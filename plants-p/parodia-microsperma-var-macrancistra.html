<p>Parodia microsperma var. macrancistra, commonly known as the Macrantha Cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>

The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its compact growth habit and striking appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is well-suited for experienced growers.</p>
