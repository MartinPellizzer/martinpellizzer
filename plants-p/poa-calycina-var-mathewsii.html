                    <h1>Poa calycina var. mathewsii</h1>
<p>Poa calycina var. mathewsii, commonly known as Mathews' bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 5 mm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
