                    <h1>Pinus monophylla var. fallax</h1>
<p>Pinus monophylla var. fallax, commonly known as the fallax variant of the single-leaf pine, is a rare and unique subspecies native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more clustered than those of the typical Pinus monophylla. The plant is evergreen, with a slow growth rate and a conical shape that becomes more rounded with age. It thrives in arid environments, often found in rocky soils and elevations ranging from 3,000 to 7,000 feet.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts.</p>
