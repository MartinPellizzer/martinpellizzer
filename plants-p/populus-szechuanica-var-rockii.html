<p>Populus szechuanica var. rockii, commonly known as the Yunnan poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall stature, often reaching heights of up to 30 meters, and its heart-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in forested areas at high elevations.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in mountainous environments.</p>
