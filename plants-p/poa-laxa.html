<p>Poa laxa, commonly known as slender meadow grass, is a species of grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, pale green blades that often curl at the tips. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and sandy soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Poa laxa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
