<p>Pycreus sanguinolentus subsp.</p>
<p>melanocephalus, commonly known as the black-headed pycreus, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, inflorescences that contrast sharply with its pale green foliage.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators such as moths and beetles.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
