                    <h1>Poa parvissima</h1>
<p>Poa parvissima, commonly known as the dwarf mountain grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like tufts that help stabilize soil in rocky and high-altitude environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Poa parvissima is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in mountainous areas with limited soil depth.</p>
