                    <h1>Pandanus latifolius var. minor</h1>
<p>Pandanus latifolius var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear fragrant, yellowish flowers, which are often used in traditional crafts and rituals. Its fibrous leaves are also utilized for making thatch and baskets.</p>
<p>This variant is generally smaller than the typical Pandanus latifolius, with a more compact growth habit.</p>
