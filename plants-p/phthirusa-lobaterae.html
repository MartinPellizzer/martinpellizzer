<p>Phthirusa lobaterae, commonly known as the lobate phthiriasis mite, is a species of mite belonging to the family Phthirioidea.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it inhabits the roots of certain plants. The mite is characterized by its small, oval-shaped body and specialized mouthparts adapted for feeding on plant tissues. Its life cycle includes several developmental stages, with the adult female laying eggs on the host plant.</p>
<p>Due to its microscopic size, it is often overlooked but plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
