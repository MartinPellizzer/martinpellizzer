                            <h1>Parthenium Fruticosum Var. Typicum</h1>
<p>Parthenium fruticosum var. typicum is a hardy shrub native to southern Africa known for its adaptability to arid conditions. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in clusters and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The species is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in degraded landscapes. Despite its ecological benefits, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
