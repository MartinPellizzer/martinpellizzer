                    <h1>Poa rigida</h1>
<p>Poa rigida, commonly known as rigid grass or mountain grass, is a perennial species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, stiff culms and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences, which contain tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Poa rigida is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
