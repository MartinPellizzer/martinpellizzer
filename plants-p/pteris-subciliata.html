<p>Pteris subciliata, commonly known as the fringed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures along the edges. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive fringed appearance that gives it its common name.</p>
