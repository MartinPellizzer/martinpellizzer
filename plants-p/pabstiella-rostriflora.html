                    <h1>Pabstiella rostriflora</h1>
<p>Pabstiella rostriflora, commonly known as the rostriflorous pabstiella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the cooler months. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Pabstiella rostriflora is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
