<p>Poa cenisia subsp.</p>
<p>arctica, commonly known as Arctic bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and fine, blue-green foliage.</p>
<p>The plant typically forms dense mats, which help stabilize fragile Arctic soils. It thrives in cold climates and is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce wind-dispersed seeds, facilitating its spread in harsh environments.</p>
