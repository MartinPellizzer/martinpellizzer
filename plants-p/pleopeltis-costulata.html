                    <h1>Pleopeltis costulata</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis costulata, commonly known as the toothed wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinct, tooth-like margin. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense mats, contributing to its ability to colonize various substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
