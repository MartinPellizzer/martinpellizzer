<p>Portulaca edulis, commonly known as purslane, is a succulent plant native to Africa, Asia, and Europe.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, prostrate stems and thick, waxy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its leaves and stems are edible, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, and often used in salads or cooked dishes.</p>
<p>Purslane is also valued for its ability to suppress weeds and improve soil health.</p>
