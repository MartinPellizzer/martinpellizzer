                    <h1>Pinus × cerambycifera</h1>
<p>Pinus × cerambycifera, commonly known as the cross pine, is a hybrid conifer resulting from the interbreeding of Pinus caribea and Pinus patula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and a conical shape, with needle-like leaves that are typically 4 to 8 inches long. The tree produces cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural range in tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with ample sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a mix of traits from both parent species, making it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
