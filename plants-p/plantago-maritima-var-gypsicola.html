                    <h1>Plantago maritima var. gypsicola</h1>
<p>Plantago maritima var. gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum plant or sea plantain, is a variant of the common plantain adapted to saline and alkaline soils.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other disturbed soils with high mineral content.</p>
<p>This variant is particularly notable for its ability to tolerate high levels of salt and gypsum, making it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
