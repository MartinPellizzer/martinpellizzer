<p>Platystele enervis, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and a single, elongated flower that typically blooms in the summer. The plant has a unique root system adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
