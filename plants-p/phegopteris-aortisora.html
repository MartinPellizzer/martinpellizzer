<p>Phegopteris aortisora, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Phegopteris aortisora make it an important component of forest ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
