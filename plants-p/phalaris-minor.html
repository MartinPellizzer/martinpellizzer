                <h1>Phalaris minor</h1>
<p>Phalaris minor, commonly known as lesser quackgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense stands.</p>
<p>Phalaris minor is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
