<p>Polypodium wobbense, commonly known as the Wobbly fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often grow in a cascading manner. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of forests. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in structure and function.</p>
