<p>Populus tremuloides f. reniformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf trembling aspen, is a variant of the trembling aspen characterized by its distinctive narrow, elongated leaves.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a unique leaf morphology with a reniform (kidney-shaped) base, setting it apart from the typical broad-leafed form. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed forests across North America. The plant is a deciduous tree or shrub, capable of forming extensive clonal colonies through root sprouting.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
