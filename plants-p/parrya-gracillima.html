<p>Parrya gracillima, commonly known as the slender parrya, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada and adjacent mountain ranges in California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected under California's Endangered Species Act.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it an important subject for conservation and ecological study.</p>
