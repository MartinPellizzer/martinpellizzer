                    <h1>Paspalum notatum</h1>
<p>Paspalum notatum, commonly known as buffalograss, is a native grass species found across much of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, dense turf and its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to drought conditions and requires minimal maintenance once established.</p>
<p>Paspalum notatum is often used in landscaping and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and ecological benefits.</p>
