<p>Pedistylis galpinii, commonly known as the Galpin's pedistylis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, including its delicate, tubular flowers and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in woodland or grassland habitats. Its blooming period occurs during the cooler months, producing small, pale blue to violet flowers that attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pedistylis galpinii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
