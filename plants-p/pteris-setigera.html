<p>Pteris setigera, commonly known as the fan-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fan-shaped fronds that are typically light green with a silvery underside. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in lines.</p>
<p>Pteris setigera thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
