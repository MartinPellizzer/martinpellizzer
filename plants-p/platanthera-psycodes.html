                    <h1>Platanthera psycodes</h1>
<p>Platanthera psycodes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Platanthera psycodes is listed as endangered in many regions.</p>
