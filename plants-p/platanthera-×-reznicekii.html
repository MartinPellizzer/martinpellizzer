                    <h1>Platanthera × reznicekii</h1>
<p>Platanthera × reznicekii, commonly known as the hybrid lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Platanthera falcata and Platanthera chlorophaea, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant produces tall, erect stems with dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that have a faint fragrance. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, often growing in association with specific fungal symbionts.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a hybrid that demonstrates the genetic diversity and adaptability within the orchid family.</p>
