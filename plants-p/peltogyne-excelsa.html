                    <h1>Peltogyne excelsa</h1>
<p>Peltogyne excelsa, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a large evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and elliptical, leathery leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the branches. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, oblong seeds. It is valued for its heavy, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
