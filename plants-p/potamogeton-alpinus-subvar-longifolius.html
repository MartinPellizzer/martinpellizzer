                    <h1>Potamogeton alpinus subvar. longifolius</h1>
<p>Potamogeton alpinus subvar. longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to cold, freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown, and it thrives in nutrient-rich, shallow waters. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a common species in lakes and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>This subvariety is adapted to cooler climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
