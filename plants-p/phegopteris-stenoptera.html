<p>Phegopteris stenoptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help anchor it in wet soil or aquatic substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Phegopteris stenoptera is often found in temperate regions, thriving in ponds, streams, and marshy areas where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
