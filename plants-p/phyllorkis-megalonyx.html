<p>Phyllorkis megalonyx, commonly known as the giant rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in difficult terrain.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.</p>
