<p>Pittosporum virgatum var. crataegifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf pittosporum, is a shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped leaves that are glossy green on top and silvery white underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal.</p>
