<p>Pelazoneuron blepharis, commonly known as the silverleaf cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny clusters of cylindrical stems that are covered in a silvery, waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Pelazoneuron blepharis is well adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with minimal water.</p>
