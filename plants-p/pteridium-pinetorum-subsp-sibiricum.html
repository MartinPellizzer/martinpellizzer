<p>Pteridium pinetorum subsp.</p>
<p>sibiricum, commonly known as the Siberian bracken, is a fern species native to cold climates in Asia. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can spread aggressively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle.</p>
