                    <h1>Polystichum aristatum var. assamicum</h1>
<p>Polystichum aristatum var. assamicum, commonly known as the Assam sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous evergreen fern characterized by its tall, narrow, and serrated fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dissemination rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
