                    <h1>Pedicularis crenularis</h1>
<p>Pedicularis crenularis, commonly known as the serrated lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, deriving some of its nutrients from the roots of host plants. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, Pedicularis crenularis is a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticultural cultivation.</p>
