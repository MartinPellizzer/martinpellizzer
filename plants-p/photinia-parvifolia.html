                    <h1>Photinia parvifolia</h1>
<p>Photinia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved firethorn, is a shrub native to southern China.</p>
<p>It features glossy, dark green leaves that are small and oval in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, which are followed by bright red berries in late summer. These berries are toxic to humans and animals, so care should be taken when handling the plant.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in gardens.</p>
