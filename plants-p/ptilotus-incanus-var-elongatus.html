The plant produces distinctive, spiky fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to harsh, sandy soils and can thrive in low-nutrient environments.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>
