                    <h1>Primula sonchifolia var. atrocoerulea</h1>
<p>Primula sonchifolia var. atrocoerulea, commonly known as the dark blue primrose, is a rare and striking variant of the primula genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deep, almost indigo-blue petals that contrast sharply with its pale yellow centers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, velvety hairs, enhancing its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique coloration, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts.</p>
