                    <h1>Polypodium leuconeurum</h1>
<p>Polypodium leuconeurum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a yellowish tint. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
