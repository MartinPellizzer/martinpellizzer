                    <h1>Platystele examen-culicum</h1>
<p>Platystele examen-culicum, commonly known as the Culiculum leafless orchid, is a rare and specialized epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying solely on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in a spike, adapted to attract specific pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is often found in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of orchid evolution and ecological adaptation in tropical ecosystems.</p>
