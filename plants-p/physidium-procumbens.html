<p>Physidium procumbens, commonly known as the creeping liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a mat-forming species that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, consisting of a flat, ribbon-like body with differentiated zones for photosynthesis and reproduction. It produces small, capsule-like structures that release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and adaptability to harsh conditions make it a common indicator species in moist, temperate habitats.</p>
