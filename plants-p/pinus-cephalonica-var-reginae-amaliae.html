<p>Pinus cephalonica var. reginae-amaliae, commonly known as the Queen Amalia's pine, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Cephalonica pine.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Greece, specifically the Peloponnese peninsula. This conifer is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like foliage. The cones are typically small and cylindrical, maturing to a reddish-brown color.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
