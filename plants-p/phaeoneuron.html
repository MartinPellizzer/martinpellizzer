                    <h1>Phaeoneuron</h1>
<p>Phaeoneuron, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale green or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has small, scale-like leaves and produces a single, showy flower that blooms for only a short period.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat requirements and limited distribution, Phaeoneuron is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
