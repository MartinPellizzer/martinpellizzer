The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem.</p>
<p>Pedicularis oxyrhyncha thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas.</p>
