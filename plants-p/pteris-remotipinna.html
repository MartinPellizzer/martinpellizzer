                    <h1>Pteris remotipinna</h1>
<p>Pteris remotipinna, commonly known as the remote pinna fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often described as lacy or feathery in appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery indusium.</p>
