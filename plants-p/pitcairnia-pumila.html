                    <h1>Pitcairnia pumila</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf pitcairnia, is a small bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central water-holding cup. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, often in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is well-suited for indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a popular choice for collectors and gardeners alike.</p>
