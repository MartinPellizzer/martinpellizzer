                    <h1>Pitcairnia saltensis</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia saltensis, commonly known as the salt marsh pitcairnia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to coastal regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. This plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding basin, a common adaptation for surviving in arid or saline environments. The leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia saltensis produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
