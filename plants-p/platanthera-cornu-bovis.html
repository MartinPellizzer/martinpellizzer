                    <h1>Platanthera cornu-bovis</h1>
<p>Platanthera cornu-bovis, commonly known as the cattle-antler orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pale green or yellowish flowers that resemble antlers, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a short-lived root system and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
