                    <h1>Phreatia clivicola</h1>
<p>Phreatia clivicola, commonly known as the cliff orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the sides of cliffs or in dense forest canopies. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale yellow, are clustered in inflorescences and bloom during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Phreatia clivicola is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
