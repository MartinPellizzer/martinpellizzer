                    <h1>Papaver rhoeas f. dentatopinnatifidum</h1>
<p>Papaver rhoeas f. dentatopinnatifidum, commonly known as the toothed and pinnatifid poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology.</p>
<p>The leaves are deeply lobed and serrated, with a pinnatifid pattern that gives them a unique, almost fern-like appearance. This form exhibits a more robust and rugged foliage compared to the typical Papaver rhoeas. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, similar to its parent species.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy red-orange flowers with a white corona, typical of the Papaver genus.</p>
