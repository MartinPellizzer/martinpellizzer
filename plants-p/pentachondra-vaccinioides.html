<p>Pentachondra vaccinioides, commonly known as the silverleaf pentachondra, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and its resilience to drought.</p>
