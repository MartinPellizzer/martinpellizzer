                    <h1>Portulaca brevifolia var. stellata</h1>
<p>Portulaca brevifolia var. stellata, commonly known as star moss purslane, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in the morning. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it a common weed in dry landscapes.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments.</p>
