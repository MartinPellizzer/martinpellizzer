<p>Pharochilum daintreanum, commonly known as the Daintree flame flower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of northeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy orange-red bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are pollinated by birds and insects, particularly honeyeaters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a notable species in the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
