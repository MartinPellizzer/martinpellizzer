<p>Polypodium myosuroides, commonly known as the horse-tail fern, is a tropical fern native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered fronds that resemble a horse's tail, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi-directionally pinnate, with small, rounded lobes that contribute to its distinctive appearance.</p>
