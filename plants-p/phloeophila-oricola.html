                    <h1>Phloeophila oricola</h1>
<p>Phloeophila oricola, commonly known as the coastal lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, coastal environments where it attaches itself to rocks or tree bark. The plant's structure is characterized by its thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the algal and fungal components. It plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized requirements, it is often found in limited geographic regions along shorelines.</p>
