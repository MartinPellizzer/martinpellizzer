<p>Pedicellaria glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular pedicellaria, is a species of sea holly native to the northeastern Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant characterized by its spiny, glandular structures called pedicellariae, which are used for defense against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, typically along rocky shores and tide pools. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to withstand the harsh conditions of coastal environments.</p>
<p>The glandular secretions on its stems and leaves may play a role in deterring predators or reducing water loss.</p>
