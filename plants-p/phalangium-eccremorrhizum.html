                    <h1>Phalangium eccremorrhizum</h1>
<p>Phalangium eccremorrhizum, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique member of the family Pichiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a non-photosynthetic plant that relies entirely on its host for nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship with certain fungi. The plant lacks true roots, leaves, and stems, instead consisting of a cluster of filaments that grow from the base of the host. It is often found in moist, shaded environments, typically associated with mosses or other fungi.</p>
<p>Its distinctive appearance and ecological role make it an intriguing subject in botanical studies.</p>
