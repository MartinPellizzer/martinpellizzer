                    <h1>Podocarpus insularis</h1>
<p>Podocarpus insularis, commonly known as the Socotra cedar, is a unique evergreen conifer native to the island of Socotra in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, scale-like leaves that are arranged in dense, flat sprays. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, typical of the Podocarpaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky slopes and in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
