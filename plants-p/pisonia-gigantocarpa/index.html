                            <h1>Pisonia Gigantocarpa</h1>
<p>Coral tree, scientifically known as Pisonia gigantocarpa, is a striking tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is renowned for its vibrant, coral-like flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a dazzling visual display. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Its unique appearance and ecological importance make it a popular subject in botany and horticulture. Despite its beauty, it requires careful cultivation to flourish in non-native environments.</p>
