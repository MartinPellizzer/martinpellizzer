                    <h1>Porterandia crosbyi</h1>
<p>Porterandia crosbyi, commonly known as the Texas snowbell, is a rare flowering plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Texas and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its branched stems. The plant has small, oval leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
