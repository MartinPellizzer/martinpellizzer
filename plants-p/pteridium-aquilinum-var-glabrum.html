                    <h1>Pteridium aquilinum var. glabrum</h1>
<p>Pteridium aquilinum var. glabrum, commonly known as the bracken fern, is a widely distributed fern species characterized by its large, triangular fronds.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate and subtropical regions, often colonizing disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has a short, stout rhizome that produces numerous stolons, allowing it to spread rapidly. Its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its successful reproduction.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, serrated margin.</p>
