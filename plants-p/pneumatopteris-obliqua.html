                    <h1>Pneumatopteris obliqua</h1>
<p>Pneumatopteris obliqua, commonly known as the oblique water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are adapted for efficient gas exchange in water. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Pneumatopteris obliqua plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to water filtration.</p>
