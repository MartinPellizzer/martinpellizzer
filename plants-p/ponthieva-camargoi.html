<p>Ponthieva camargoi, commonly known as the Camargue fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Camargue region of France.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands and marshy areas. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing cones, are typically hidden within the foliage.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Ponthieva camargoi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
