<p>Poa nemoralis var. bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive bulbous base, which allows it to survive harsh conditions. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in nutrient-poor soils and is an important component of grassland ecosystems.</p>
