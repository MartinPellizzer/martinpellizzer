                    <h1>Potentilla flabellifolia var. pilosior</h1>
<p>Potentilla flabellifolia var. pilosior, commonly known as the silky potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and features narrow, elongated leaves covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often described as having a soft, fuzzy texture due to the dense pubescence on both the upper and lower surfaces.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
