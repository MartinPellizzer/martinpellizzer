                    <h1>Pedicularis pennellii var. insularis</h1>
<p>Pedicularis pennellii var. insularis, commonly known as the island monkey orchid, is a rare and specialized member of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. This variety is native to the remote islands of the South Pacific, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically bright red or orange, with a unique spurred structure that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
