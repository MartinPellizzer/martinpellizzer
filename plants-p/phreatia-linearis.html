<p>Phreatia linearis, commonly known as the linear phreatia, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and produces striking, showy inflorescences with pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories or near water sources. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for both horticultural and ecological studies.</p>
