                    <h1>Potentilla anserina f. furcata</h1>
<p>Potentilla anserina f. furcata, commonly known as the silverweed or stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss and reflects sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its stems are usually prostrate or ascending, and it often forms dense mats on rocky or dry soils.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
