                    <h1>Pentaphragma insigne</h1>
<p>Pentaphragma insigne, commonly known as the showy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often translucent and contain specialized bladder-like structures. These bladders are used to trap small aquatic organisms, which the plant then absorbs for nutrients. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptations make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
