<p>Phreatia pleistantha, commonly known as the Philippine ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to white flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree branches or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
