<p>Phleum viride, commonly known as green fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is frequently found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Phleum viride is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
