<p>Poa trivialis f. majorica, commonly known as the Majorcan meadow grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in Spain and Portugal. The plant typically forms dense, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora in its native habitat.</p>
