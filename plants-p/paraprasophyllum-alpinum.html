                    <h1>Paraprasophyllum alpinum</h1>
<p>Paraprasophyllum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine paraprasophyllum, is a rare and specialized plant found in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, cushion-like structure that helps it withstand harsh climatic conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, adapting to pollination by wind or specialized insects. Its leaves are thick and waxy, reducing water loss in arid, cold climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
