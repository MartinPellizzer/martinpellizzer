<p>Panicum caespitosum, commonly known as bush bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue-green spikelets that are characteristic of the Panicum genus. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically valuable.</p>
<p>It is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to establish quickly in various soil types.</p>
