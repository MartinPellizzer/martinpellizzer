<p>Polypodium simplicissimum, commonly known as the simple holly fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a compact and upright growth habit. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive line along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium simplicissimum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions.</p>
