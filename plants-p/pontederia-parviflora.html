                    <h1>Pontederia parviflora</h1>
<p>Pontederia parviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water hyacinth, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy coating that helps repel water. The plant produces small, fragrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in dense clusters above the water. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native regions, impacting local ecosystems.</p>
