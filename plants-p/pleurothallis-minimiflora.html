<p>Pleurothallis minimiflora, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a small epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces tiny, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green, often clustered in small inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value.</p>
