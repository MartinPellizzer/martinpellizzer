<p>Pyrethrum cassium, commonly known as the African pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers. The plant produces small, cylindrical flower heads that contain numerous fine, hair-like structures called phytanthus. These structures are the source of natural insecticides due to their pyrethrin content.</p>
