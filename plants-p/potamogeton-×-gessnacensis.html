                    <h1>Potamogeton × gessnacensis</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × gessnacensis, commonly known as the hybrid water plantain, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Potamogeton perfoliatus and Potamogeton praelatus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged in aquatic environments. This plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its flowers are small and clustered, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
