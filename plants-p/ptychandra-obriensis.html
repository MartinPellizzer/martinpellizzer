<p>Ptychandra obriensis, commonly known as the Obrin's ptychandra, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as montane forests, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are usually ovate with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ptychandra obriensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
