                    <h1>Pollinia eucnemis</h1>
<p>Pollinia eucnemis, commonly known as the orchid bee pollinia, is a unique structure found in certain orchid species.</p>
<p>It consists of sticky masses of pollen that are transferred from one flower to another by pollinators, primarily bees. These pollinia are often attached to the bodies of insects, facilitating cross-pollination between plants. The structure is adapted for specific pollination syndromes, ensuring efficient pollen transfer.</p>
<p>Its morphology and function are closely linked to the evolutionary relationships between orchids and their pollinators.</p>
