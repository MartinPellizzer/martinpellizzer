                    <h1>Pentanema parietarioides</h1>
<p>Pentanema parietarioides, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a low-growing habit with dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it conserve water in harsh environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which reduce transpiration and reflect sunlight.</p>
<p>Pentanema parietarioides is often found growing on rocky outcrops and dry soil, making it well adapted to extreme conditions.</p>
