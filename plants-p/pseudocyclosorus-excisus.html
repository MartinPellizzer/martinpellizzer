                    <h1>Pseudocyclosorus excisus</h1>
<p>Pseudocyclosorus excisus, commonly known as the excised cyclosorus, is a rare fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically divided into small, serrated segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
