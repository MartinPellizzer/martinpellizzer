                <h1>Pinus apollinis</h1>
<p>Pinus apollinis, commonly known as the Apollo pine, is a rare and ancient species of conifer native to the mountainous regions of Southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces distinctive cone-shaped fruits that contain seeds covered in a protective scale. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid climate to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pinus apollinis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
