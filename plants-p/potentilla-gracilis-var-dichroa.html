                    <h1>Potentilla gracilis var. dichroa</h1>
<p>Potentilla gracilis var. dichroa, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves that reflect light and provide a striking visual contrast against its green stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens.</p>
