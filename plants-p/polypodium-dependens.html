<p>Polypodium dependens, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees or rocks, using its rhizomes to anchor itself while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a dense, hanging structure. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Polypodium dependens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
