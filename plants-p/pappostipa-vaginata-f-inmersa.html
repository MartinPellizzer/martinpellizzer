                    <h1>Pappostipa vaginata f. inmersa</h1>
<p>Pappostipa vaginata f. inmersa, commonly known as the submerged false brome, is a rare grass species characterized by its unique aquatic adaptation.</p>
<p>It exhibits a prostrate growth habit with leaves that are often submerged or floating in wetland environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This ecotype is typically found in shallow, nutrient-rich waters, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediment and supporting aquatic ecosystems.</p>
