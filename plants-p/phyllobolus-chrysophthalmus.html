<p>Phyllobolus chrysophthalmus, commonly known as the golden-eyed leaf beetle, is a species of leaf beetle found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow and black coloration, which serves as a form of aposematic warning to potential predators. The beetle's larvae feed on the leaves of various plants, often causing noticeable damage to host species. Its life cycle includes several developmental stages, with adults typically emerging in the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for the beetle and its potential ecological impact on local flora.</p>
