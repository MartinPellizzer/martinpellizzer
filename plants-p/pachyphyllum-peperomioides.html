<p>Pachyphyllum peperomioides, commonly known as the silver star cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>The species is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts.</p>
