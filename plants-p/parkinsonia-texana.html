                    <h1>Parkinsonia texana</h1>
<p>Parkinsonia texana, commonly known as Texas huisache, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing some protection against fire and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Parkinsonia texana is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
