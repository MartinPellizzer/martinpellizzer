<p>Pyrus arbutifolia subsp.</p>
<p>nigra, commonly known as blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and small, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the autumn. These berries are a food source for birds and other wildlife, and the plant is often used in hedgerows for its dense growth habit.</p>
<p>It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and hardy nature.</p>
