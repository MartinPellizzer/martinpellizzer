                    <h1>Pycnoloma metacoelum</h1>
<p>Pycnoloma metacoelum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence and striking, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical features include fleshy roots adapted for water storage and specialized structures for absorbing moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile nature and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
