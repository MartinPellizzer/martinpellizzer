                    <h1>Pycreus compressiformis</h1>
<p>Pycreus compressiformis, commonly known as the compressed-form fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments, often found in slow-moving streams and marshy areas. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are densely packed, giving it a compact appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
