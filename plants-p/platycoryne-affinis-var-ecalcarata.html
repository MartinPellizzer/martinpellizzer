<p>It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The variety ecalcarata is distinguished by the presence of short, stiff hairs on its leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
