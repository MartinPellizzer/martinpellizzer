<p>Psittacanthus cuneifolius subsp.</p>
<p>viscoides, commonly known as the viscous psittacanthus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to Central and South America, particularly in regions with humid, tropical climates.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, adding ornamental value to its appearance.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often grown as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
