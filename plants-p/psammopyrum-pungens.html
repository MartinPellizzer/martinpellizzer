                    <h1>Psammopyrum pungens</h1>
<p>Psammopyrum pungens, commonly known as the spiny pincushion cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and spiny, segmented stems that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often followed by small, red fruits. Its adaptations include thick, fleshy stems for water storage and a nocturnal blooming pattern to avoid daytime heat.</p>
<p>Psammopyrum pungens is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique appearance.</p>
