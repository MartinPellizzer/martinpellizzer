<p>Platycarpum, commonly known as the broad-fruit plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The fruit is typically a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Platycarpum species are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments.</p>
