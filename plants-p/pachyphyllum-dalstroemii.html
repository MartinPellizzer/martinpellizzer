                    <h1>Pachyphyllum dalstroemii</h1>
<p>Pachyphyllum dalstroemii, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and protect it from herbivores.</p>
<p>Pachyphyllum dalstroemii is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for xerophytic gardens.</p>
