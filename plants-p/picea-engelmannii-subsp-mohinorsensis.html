<p>Picea engelmannii subsp.</p>
<p>mohinorsensis, commonly known as the Mohinorsky Engelmann spruce, is a rare subspecies native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its conical shape, dark green needle-like leaves, and a dense, compact growth habit.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
