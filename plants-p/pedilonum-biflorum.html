<p>Pedilonum biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered slipper, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pale yellow to green in color. The plant produces two small, fragrant flowers per stem, which bloom during the late spring or early summer. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, shaded environments where it grows.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pedilonum biflorum is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs.</p>
