<p>Pulicaria adenensis, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent appearance with hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Pulicaria adenensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
