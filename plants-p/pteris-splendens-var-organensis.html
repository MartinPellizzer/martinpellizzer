<p>Pteris splendens var. organensis, commonly known as the organensis water fern, is a variant of the sword fern family.</p>
<p>It is a tropical evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to maintain its lush appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
