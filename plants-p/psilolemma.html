                    <h1>Psilolemma</h1>
<p>Psilolemma, commonly known as the "naked seed coat," is a specialized structure found in certain seed plants.</p>
<p>It is a thin, membranous layer that directly surrounds the seed embryo, lacking the thickened, protective layers found in other seed coats. The psilolemma is typically composed of a single layer of cells and is often translucent, allowing for the exchange of gases and water. This structure is particularly prominent in some gymnosperms and certain primitive angiosperms.</p>
<p>Its simplicity and permeability make it an important feature in the early development and germination of the seed.</p>
