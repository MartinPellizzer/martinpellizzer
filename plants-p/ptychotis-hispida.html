<p>Ptychotis hispida, commonly known as the rough bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually short and club-shaped, with a rough texture due to the presence of small, stiff hairs.</p>
<p>Ptychotis hispida is often found in temperate regions and is known for its unique adaptations to aquatic life.</p>
