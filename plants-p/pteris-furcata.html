                    <h1>Pteris furcata</h1>
<p>Pteris furcata, commonly known as the forked water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
