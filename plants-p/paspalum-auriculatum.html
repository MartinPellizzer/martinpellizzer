                    <h1>Paspalum auriculatum</h1>
<p>Paspalum auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with auriculate (ear-like) bases. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in restoration projects for stabilizing soil in wetland areas.</p>
