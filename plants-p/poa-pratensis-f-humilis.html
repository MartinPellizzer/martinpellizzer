                    <h1>Poa pratensis f. humilis</h1>
<p>Poa pratensis f. humilis, commonly known as the creeping meadowgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows and pastures. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of grassland ecosystems.</p>
