                    <h1>Payena mentzelii</h1>
<p>Payena mentzelii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and high value for timber, it is considered vulnerable to overexploitation.</p>
