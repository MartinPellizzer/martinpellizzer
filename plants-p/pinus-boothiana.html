                    <h1>Pinus boothiana</h1>
<p>Pinus boothiana, commonly known as the Booth's pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree that typically grows in high-altitude forests, often in association with other endemic species. The tree has slender, cylindrical cones and needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pinus boothiana is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
