                    <h1>Platanthera chlorantha var. angustata</h1>
<p>Platanthera chlorantha var. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to moist, shaded habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features a slender, branching stem with numerous small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose, lateral raceme. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in bogs, wet meadows, and along stream banks.</p>
