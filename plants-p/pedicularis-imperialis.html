<p>Pedicularis imperialis, commonly known as the imperial lousewort, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant that grows in alpine and subalpine regions, primarily in the European Alps and Scandinavia. The plant features showy, spurred flowers that range in color from red to orange, attracting specific pollinators like bees and flies. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
