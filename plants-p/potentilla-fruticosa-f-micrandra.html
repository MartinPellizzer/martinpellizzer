                    <h1>Potentilla fruticosa f. micrandra</h1>
<p>Potentilla fruticosa f. micrandra, commonly known as the small-flowered cinquefoil, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features dense, upright growth with small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its hardy nature and ability to form dense, low-growing mats in exposed conditions.</p>
