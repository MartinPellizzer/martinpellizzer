                    <h1>Pitcairnia pyramidata</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia pyramidata, commonly known as the sacred mistletoe, is a bromeliad native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure, which is used to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds. Its aerial roots allow it to attach to trees, making it an epiphytic species.</p>
<p>The plant's unique adaptations enable it to thrive in high-altitude, humid environments.</p>
