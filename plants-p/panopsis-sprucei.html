                    <h1>Panopsis sprucei</h1>
<p>Panopsis sprucei, commonly known as the Alaska spruce, is a coniferous tree native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in spirals. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in boreal forests and alpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in cooler climates.</p>
