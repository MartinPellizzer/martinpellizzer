                    <h1>Potentilla sierrae-blancae</h1>
<p>Potentilla sierrae-blancae, commonly known as Sierra Whitecinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or talus slopes, where it thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
