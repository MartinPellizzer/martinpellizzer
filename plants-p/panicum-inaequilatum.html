<p>Panicum inaequilatum, commonly known as the unequal panicgrass, is a species of grass native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects or as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
