                    <h1>Phyllanthus meridensis</h1>
<p>Phyllanthus meridensis, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is often found in rocky soils and desert environments. Its unique morphology allows it to thrive in harsh, dry conditions with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Phyllanthus meridensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
