                    <h1>Polygonum aviculare var. ramosissimum</h1>
<p>Polygonum aviculare var. ramosissimum, commonly known as the prostrate knotgrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant characterized by its sprawling growth habit.</p>
<p>It features small, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense inflorescences, which are often borne on short, erect stalks. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it a common weed in agricultural settings.</p>
