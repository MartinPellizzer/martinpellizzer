                    <h1>Papaver desertorum</h1>
<p>Papaver desertorum, commonly known as the desert poppy, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It produces striking, vividly colored flowers that range from red to orange, often with a dark central spot. The plant has a taproot system that allows it to survive in dry conditions by accessing deep water sources. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The seeds are small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or sandy soils.</p>
