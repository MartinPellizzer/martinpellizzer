                    <h1>Pentaschistis borussica var. minor</h1>
<p>Pentaschistis borussica var. minor, commonly known as the lesser Siberian bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in tundra and alpine meadows. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces a single flower per stem, making it visually striking despite its modest size.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
