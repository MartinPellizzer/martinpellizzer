<p>Paepalanthus regalis var. recurvata, commonly known as the royal paepalanthus, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height, adorned with vibrant purple and red bracts. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that bloom sequentially along the inflorescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
