                    <h1>Pescatoria pulvinaris</h1>
<p>Pescatoria pulvinaris, commonly known as the sunspine fern, is a unique vascular plant characterized by its intricate frond structure.</p>
<p>Its leaves are divided into numerous small, finger-like segments that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate rainforests. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly across the forest floor.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
