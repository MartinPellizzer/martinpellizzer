<p>Piptadeniastrum, commonly known as the "African mahogany," is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its deciduous, often thorny trees with compound leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered, and the fruits are legumes that split open to release seeds. Piptadeniastrum species are valued for their durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, many species are now threatened with extinction.</p>
