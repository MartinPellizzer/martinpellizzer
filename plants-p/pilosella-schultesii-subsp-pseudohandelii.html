<p>Pilosella schultesii subsp.</p>
<p>pseudohandelii, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy, often silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it is adapted to cold and harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
