<p>Phoradendron leucarpum subsp.</p>
<p>tomentosum, commonly known as the white-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the southeastern United States. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent.</p>
<p>Its unique growth habit and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
