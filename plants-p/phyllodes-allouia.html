<p>Phyllodes allouia, commonly known as the Allouia phyllodes, is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its unique, flattened, leaf-like structures called phyllodes.

<p>It is well adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
