                    <h1>Panicum guineense</h1>
<p>Panicum guineense, commonly known as Guinea grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa, particularly found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and spreading habit, it can become invasive in certain areas.</p>
