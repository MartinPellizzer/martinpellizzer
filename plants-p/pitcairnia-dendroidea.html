<p>Pitcairnia dendroidea, commonly known as the tree pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>

The plant produces striking inflorescences with long, colorful bracts that can range from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses and as a houseplant.</p>
