<p>Pentaraphia cumanensis, commonly known as the Cumanese orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and is often found near streams or in undergrowth. Its root system is fibrous, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
