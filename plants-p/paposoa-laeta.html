                    <h1>Paposoa laeta</h1>
<p>Paposoa laeta, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of its host trees, primarily pines and podocarps, and relies on them for water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native birds. Its leaves are evergreen, and it has a unique ability to photosynthesize, though it still depends on its host for survival.</p>
<p>Paposoa laeta plays a significant role in the ecological balance of New Zealand's forests.</p>
