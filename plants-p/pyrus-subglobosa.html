                    <h1>Pyrus subglobosa</h1>
<p>Pyrus subglobosa, commonly known as the globe pear, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded, often multi-stemmed growth habit and thick, peeling bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruit that ripens in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth margin with a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>Pyrus subglobosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in horticulture.</p>
