                    <h1>Pitcairnia mirandae</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia mirandae, commonly known as the Mirand√° pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, a common adaptation in its humid, high-altitude habitat. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically broad and pointed, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia mirandae is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
