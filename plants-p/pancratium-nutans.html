                    <h1>Pancratium nutans</h1>
<p>Pancratium nutans, commonly known as the nodding lantern or sea daffodil, is a striking flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features strap-like, grassy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Pancratium nutans thrives in sandy soils and is often found growing near the shoreline, where it is exposed to salt spray.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a notable species in coastal botanical studies.</p>
