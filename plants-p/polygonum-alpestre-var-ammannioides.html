                    <h1>Polygonum alpestre var. ammannioides</h1>
<p>Polygonum alpestre var. ammannioides, commonly known as the alpine knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it is adapted to cold and harsh conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This species is often found in mountainous habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens that mimic alpine landscapes.</p>
