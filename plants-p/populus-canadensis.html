                    <h1>Populus canadensis</h1>
<p>Populus canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian poplar, is a large, fast-growing tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are wind-pollinated. Its bark is smooth and light gray when young, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Populus canadensis is often used in reforestation and for its timber, which is valued for its strength and workability.</p>
