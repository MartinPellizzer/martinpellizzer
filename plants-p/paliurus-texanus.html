                    <h1>Paliurus texanus</h1>
<p>Paliurus texanus, commonly known as Texas palo blanco, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale white bark, which becomes fissured with age, and its compound leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental features, it is sometimes cultivated in arid landscapes.</p>
