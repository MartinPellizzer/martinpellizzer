<p>Phalaris aquatica var. macrostachya, commonly known as the broad-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It features grass-like leaves that are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear spike-like clusters of small, greenish-white flowers.
