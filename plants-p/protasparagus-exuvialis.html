                    <h1>Protasparagus exuvialis</h1>
<p>Protasparagus exuvialis, commonly known as the desert asparagus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically reduced to small scales, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Protasparagus exuvialis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
