                    <h1>Polystichum × hagenahii</h1>
<p>Polystichum × hagenahii, commonly known as the Hagen's shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Polystichum setiferum and Polystichum acutiforme.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous fern characterized by its large, deeply divided fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its elegant, feathery foliage that adds texture and visual interest to the landscape.</p>
<p>Polystichum × hagenahii is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shaded environments and its ability to spread through rhizomes.</p>
