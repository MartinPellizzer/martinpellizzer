                    <h1>Phoradendron viscifolium</h1>
<p>Phoradendron viscifolium, commonly known as the sticky leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the Americas.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps in adhering to its host and deterring herbivores. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Viscaraceae family and is characterized by its specialized roots that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract nutrients.</p>
