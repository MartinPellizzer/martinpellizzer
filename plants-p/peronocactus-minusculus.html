                    <h1>Peronocactus minusculus</h1>
<p>Peronocactus minusculus, commonly known as the miniature cactus or dwarf cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular plant with a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, typical of cacti adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and low maintenance, it is often used as a decorative plant in both outdoor and indoor settings.</p>
