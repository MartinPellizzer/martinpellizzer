                    <h1>Pisonia corniculata</h1>
<p>Pisonia corniculata, commonly known as the coral tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, bright red or orange bracts that resemble coral, which are not true flowers but modified leaves. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters, often surrounded by the showy bracts. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for coastal and urban landscapes.</p>
<p>Pisonia corniculata is often used in ornamental horticulture for its vibrant, long-lasting display.</p>
