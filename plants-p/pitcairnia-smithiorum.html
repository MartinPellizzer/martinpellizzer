                    <h1>Pitcairnia smithiorum</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia smithiorum, commonly known as the Smith's pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, a common adaptation in its natural habitat. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that can last for several months, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia smithiorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
