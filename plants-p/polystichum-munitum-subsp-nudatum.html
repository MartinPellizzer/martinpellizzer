<p>Polystichum munitum subsp.</p>
<p>nudatum, commonly known as the Pacific silver fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive, silver-gray fronds that are densely covered with fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor it to the soil while spreading vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
