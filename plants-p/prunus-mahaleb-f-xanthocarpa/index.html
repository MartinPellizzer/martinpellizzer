<p>Mahaleb cherry, scientifically known as Prunus mahaleb f. xanthocarpa, is a rare and ornamental variant of the common Mahaleb cherry. This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and is prized for its striking yellow fruit, which contrasts beautifully with its delicate pink blossoms. While it shares many characteristics with its parent species, the xanthocarpa form exhibits a unique coloration that makes it a sought-after addition to gardens and botanical collections. Its small size and compact growth habit make it ideal for smaller spaces, yet it still commands attention with its seasonal display. Despite its beauty, the Mahaleb cherry requires specific care to thrive, making it a rewarding choice for dedicated plant enthusiasts.</p>
