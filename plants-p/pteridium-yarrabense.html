                    <h1>Pteridium yarrabense</h1>
<p>Pteridium yarrabense, commonly known as the Yarrabene bracken, is a fern native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that form a thick mat on the ground. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal heathlands and sand dunes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread rapidly, forming extensive colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
