                    <h1>Phellopterus littoralis</h1>
<p>Phellopterus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal phellopterus, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to thrive in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or white, which are pollinated by wind or insects. Its root system is highly developed, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat, Phellopterus littoralis is considered a sensitive indicator species for coastal ecosystem health.</p>
