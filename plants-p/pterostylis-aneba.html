<p>Pterostylis aneba, commonly known as the yellow-stained helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a slender, grass-like leaf and a single, elongated flower spike that bears a single, distinctive yellow-green flower. Its pollination is primarily achieved through specific insect species, particularly flies.</p>
<p>The orchid's unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important subject in botanical studies.</p>
