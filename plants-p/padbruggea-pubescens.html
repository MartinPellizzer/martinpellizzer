<p>Padbruggea pubescens, commonly known as the woolly padbruggea, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
