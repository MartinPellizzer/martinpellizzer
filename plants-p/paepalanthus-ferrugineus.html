                    <h1>Paepalanthus ferrugineus</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty pincushion cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a spherical or flattened shape, resembling a pincushion. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Paepalanthus ferrugineus is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
