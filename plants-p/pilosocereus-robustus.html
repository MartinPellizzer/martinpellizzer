                    <h1>Pilosocereus robustus</h1>
<p>Pilosocereus robustus, commonly known as the robust night bloomer, is a cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of white or pink, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and unique blooming habit, it is a popular choice for succulent collections and xeriscaping.</p>
