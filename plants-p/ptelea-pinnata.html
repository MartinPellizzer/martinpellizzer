                    <h1>Ptelea pinnata</h1>
<p>Ptelea pinnata, commonly known as the silky dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, almost lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in the spring, which are followed by blue-black berries in the fall. Its bark is smooth and gray, often exfoliating to reveal a mottled pattern.</p>
<p>Ptelea pinnata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats.</p>
