<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. Native to specific regions in South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with a short, sturdy stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
