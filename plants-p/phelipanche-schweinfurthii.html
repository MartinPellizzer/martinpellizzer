                    <h1>Phelipanche schweinfurthii</h1>
<p>Phelipanche schweinfurthii, commonly known as the Mediterranean broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of flowering plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, fleshy stem. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in dry, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings.</p>
