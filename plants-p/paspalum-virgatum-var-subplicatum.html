                    <h1>Paspalum virgatum var. subplicatum</h1>
<p>Paspalum virgatum var. subplicatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often folded or rolled when young. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects.</p>
