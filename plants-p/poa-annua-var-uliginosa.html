                    <h1>Poa annua var. uliginosa</h1>
<p>Poa annua var. uliginosa, commonly known as the swamp annual bluegrass, is a perennial grass species that thrives in wet or marshy environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of other Poa species. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are often inconspicuous, and it is commonly found in temperate regions with moist soils. It is adaptable to a variety of soil types but prefers nutrient-rich, waterlogged conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
