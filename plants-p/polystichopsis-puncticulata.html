                    <h1>Polystichopsis puncticulata</h1>
<p>Polystichopsis puncticulata, commonly known as the punctuated fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered and covered by a thin, membranous indusium.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it a valuable subject for study in both horticulture and ecological research.</p>
