                    <h1>Physocodon macrobotrys</h1>
<p>Physocodon macrobotrys, commonly known as the giant water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It has broad, waxy leaves that float on the water surface, with a spongy underside that helps it stay afloat. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling those of the common water hyacinth. It is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to dense mats on water surfaces.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in non-native environments.</p>
