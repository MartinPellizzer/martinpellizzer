                    <h1>Plectritis capitata</h1>
<p>Plectritis capitata, commonly known as the common hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a single, compact head. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Plectritis capitata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
