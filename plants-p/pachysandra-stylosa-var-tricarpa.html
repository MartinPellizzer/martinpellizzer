                    <h1>Pachysandra stylosa var. tricarpa</h1>
<p>Pachysandra stylosa var. tricarpa, commonly known as the three-fruited pachysandra, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage that remains throughout the year, making it suitable for ground cover in shaded areas. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by three-lobed, berry-like fruits that mature to a deep red color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form a thick mat, which helps suppress weeds.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
