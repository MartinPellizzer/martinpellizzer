                    <h1>Pitcairnia sceptrigera</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia sceptrigera, commonly known as the royal pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a common adaptation among bromeliads. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences that bear striking, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its leaves are typically broad, glossy, and covered in fine, white trichomes that help in water retention.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia sceptrigera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to bright, indirect light in indoor environments.</p>
