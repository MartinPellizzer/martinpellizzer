The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in the understorey of evergreen forests. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, clustered flowers in spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
