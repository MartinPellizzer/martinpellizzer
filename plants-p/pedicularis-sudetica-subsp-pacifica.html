<p>Pedicularis sudetica subsp.</p>
<p>pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often on rocky slopes or in meadows at high elevations. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and the stems are erect, bearing the showy inflorescences.</p>
<p>This subspecies is part of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its hemiparasitic nature, where the plant derives some of its nutrients from its host plants.</p>
