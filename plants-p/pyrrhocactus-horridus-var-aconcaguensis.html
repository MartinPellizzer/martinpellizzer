<p>Pyrrhocactus horridus var. aconcaguensis, commonly known as the Aconcagua pyrrhocactus, is a rare cactus native to the Andean region of Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, typical of desert plants. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring season, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
