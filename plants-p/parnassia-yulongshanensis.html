<p>Parnassia yulongshanensis, commonly known as the Yulongshan Parnassia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Yulong Mountains in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers that resemble those of the genus Parnassia. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change.</p>
