<p>Phyllanthus polymorphus, commonly known as the variegated stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are often variegated with white or yellow markings, adding to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Phyllanthus polymorphus is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to tolerate bright, indirect light.</p>
