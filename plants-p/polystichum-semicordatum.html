<p>Polystichum semicordatum, commonly known as the heart-shaped fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed, heart-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with new fronds emerging from the crown each year.</p>
