                    <h1>Polypodium subirideum</h1>
<p>Polypodium subirideum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a small evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically 10â€“30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
