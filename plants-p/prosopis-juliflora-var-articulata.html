                    <h1>Prosopis juliflora var. articulata</h1>
<p>Prosopis juliflora var. articulata, commonly known as the screwbean mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and its ability to thrive in harsh, drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects, followed by the development of long, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It has deep roots that allow it to access groundwater, making it highly resilient to extreme conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions outside its native range.</p>
