                    <h1>Polypodium parietinum</h1>
<p>Polypodium parietinum, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a small evergreen fern that thrives in rocky, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a compact, creeping growth habit with rhizomes that anchor it to limestone or other rocky substrates. Its fronds are typically narrow and linear, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces spores in spherical clusters called sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium parietinum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ability to colonize difficult terrain.</p>
