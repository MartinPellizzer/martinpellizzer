                    <h1>Pelexia vaginata</h1>
<p>Pelexia vaginata, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Pelexia vaginata plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and rocky mountainous areas.</p>
