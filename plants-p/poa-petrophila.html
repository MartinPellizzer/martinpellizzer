                    <h1>Poa petrophila</h1>
<p>Poa petrophila, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green leaves. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous and wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Poa petrophila is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
