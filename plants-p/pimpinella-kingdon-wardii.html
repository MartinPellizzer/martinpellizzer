                    <h1>Pimpinella kingdon-wardii</h1>
<p>Pimpinella kingdon-wardii, commonly known as the Kingdon-Ward's cowparley, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of western Yunnan, China, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its habitat is highly specific, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural range.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
