                    <h1>Puccinellia</h1>
<p>Puccinellia, commonly known as saltbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in saline or arid environments, showcasing their adaptability to harsh conditions. Many species of Puccinellia have small, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss and increase drought tolerance. They often form dense mats or low shrubs, which help stabilize soil in coastal or inland salt marshes.</p>
<p>The genus includes both annual and perennial species, with some being important for forage or ecological restoration.</p>
