<p>Pedicularis romanzovii, commonly known as the Romanzov's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Its unique morphology includes spurred petals and a distinctive calyx that aids in pollination by insects.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
