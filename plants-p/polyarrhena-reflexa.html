                    <h1>Polyarrhena reflexa</h1>
<p>Polyarrhena reflexa, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its fruit is a slender, hairy achene that is dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across dry, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Polyarrhena reflexa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
