                    <h1>Poa rigens f. filipes</h1>
<p>Poa rigens f. filipes, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a variant of the bentgrass species characterized by its fine, delicate foliage.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in moist, well-drained soils, often in meadows or along stream banks. It has a low-growing habit with a dense, mat-like structure that helps it thrive in shaded or compacted environments. The leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
