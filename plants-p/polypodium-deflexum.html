<p>Polypodium deflexum, commonly known as the flexible shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often drooping or curled, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its rhizomes are wiry and can form dense mats, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Polypodium deflexum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
