<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in association with other rare alpine flora.</p>
