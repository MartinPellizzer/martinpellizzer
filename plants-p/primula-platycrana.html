<p>Primula platycrana, commonly known as the broad-leaf primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically blooms in early spring, making it a notable early-flowering species. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky habitats.</p>
