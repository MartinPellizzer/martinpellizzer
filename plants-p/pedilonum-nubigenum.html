<p>Pedilonum nubigenum, commonly known as the cloud-footed orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green leaves that are adapted to thrive in cool, misty environments. The plant produces tiny, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the early morning hours. Its root system is specialized to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Pedilonum nubigenum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
