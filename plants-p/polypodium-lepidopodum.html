<p>Polypodium lepidopodum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green and finely divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are deciduous, with the plant shedding them seasonally to conserve energy.</p>
