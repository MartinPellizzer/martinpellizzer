                    <h1>Platanthera atropatanica</h1>
<p>Platanthera atropatanica, commonly known as the purple twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in many regions.</p>
