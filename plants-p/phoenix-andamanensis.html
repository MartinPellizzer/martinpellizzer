<p>Phoenix andamanensis, commonly known as the Andaman date palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, sweet fruits similar to dates. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires ample sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts.</p>
