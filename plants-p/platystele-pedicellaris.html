                    <h1>Platystele pedicellaris</h1>
<p>Platystele pedicellaris, commonly known as the pedicellate ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white leaves and its unique, slender, unbranched inflorescence. Its flowers are small, with three sepals and three petals, and are often pale green or white in color.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Platystele pedicellaris is considered critically endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
