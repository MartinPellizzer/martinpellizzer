                    <h1>Phoradendron bolleanum subsp. pauciflorum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron bolleanum subsp.</p>
<p>pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, leathery leaves and produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in small inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it photosynthesizes to some extent on its own. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting bird populations and contributing to the biodiversity of its forest ecosystems.</p>
