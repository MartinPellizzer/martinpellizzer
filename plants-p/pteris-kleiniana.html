<p>Pteris kleiniana, commonly known as the dwarf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Pteris kleiniana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care.</p>
