                    <h1>Potentilla anserina var. nuda</h1>
<p>Potentilla anserina var. nuda, commonly known as the naked sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, greenish-yellow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its lack of stipules, giving it a more streamlined appearance compared to other Potentilla species.</p>
