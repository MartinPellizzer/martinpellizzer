                    <h1>Pseudodanthonia trigyna</h1>
<p>Pseudodanthonia trigyna, commonly known as the narrowleaf muhly, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist to wet soils.</p>
<p>Pseudodanthonia trigyna is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms.</p>
