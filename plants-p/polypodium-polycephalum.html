<p>Polypodium polycephalum, commonly known as the horseâ€™s tail fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, clustered fronds that resemble a horse's tail, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of its fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
