<p>Purshia hispida, commonly known as the roughleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish bark, spiny branches, and small, yellowish-green leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, reddish-purple flowers in early spring, which are followed by elongated, ribbed fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Purshia hispida is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native range.</p>
