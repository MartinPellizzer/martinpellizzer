                    <h1>Potentilla subpalmata</h1>
<p>Potentilla subpalmata, commonly known as the subpalmate cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately divided leaves, which are typically five-lobed and have a distinctive, almost palm-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
