                    <h1>Peucedanum glaucum var. nagpurense</h1>
<p>Peucedanum glaucum var. nagpurense, commonly known as the Nagpuren mountain angelica, is a rare and endemic plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, typically between 2,000 and 4,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
