<p>Potentilla anachoretica var. planiuscula, commonly known as the smoothleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
