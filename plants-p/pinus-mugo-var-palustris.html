                    <h1>Pinus mugo var. palustris</h1>
<p>Pinus mugo var. palustris, commonly known as the swamp mountain pine, is a variant of the creeping pine that thrives in moist, acidic soils.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit and short, twisted branches. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its needles are typically dark green and remain on the plant for several years before shedding.</p>
<p>This variant is well adapted to wetland environments and is often found in bogs and heathlands.</p>
