<p>Polypodium semipinnatifidum f. indivisum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically narrow and deeply divided, with a unique structure that sets it apart from other members of the Polypodium genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in specific microhabitats.</p>
