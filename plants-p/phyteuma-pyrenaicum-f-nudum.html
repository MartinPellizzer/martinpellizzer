<p>Phyteuma pyrenaicum f. nudum, commonly known as the naked phyteuma, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the Pyrenees region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a tendency to remain largely leafless during the winter months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
