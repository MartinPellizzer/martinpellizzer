                    <h1>Polypodium dulitense</h1>
<p>Polypodium dulitense, commonly known as the Philippine wall fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often grow in dense clusters on rocky surfaces. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, making it a common epiphyte in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
