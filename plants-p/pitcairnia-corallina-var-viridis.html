                    <h1>Pitcairnia corallina var. viridis</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia corallina var. viridis, commonly known as the Emerald Pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like rosette of bright green, waxy leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
