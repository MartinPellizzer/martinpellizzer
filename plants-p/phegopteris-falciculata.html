                    <h1>Phegopteris falciculata</h1>
<p>Phegopteris falciculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically 15â€“30 cm long. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the water.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bright green and can be distinguished by their finely divided, falcate (sickle-shaped) pinnae.</p>
