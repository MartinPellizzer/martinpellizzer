                    <h1>Prasoxylon alliaceum</h1>
<p>Prasoxylon alliaceum, commonly known as the garlic yew, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, evergreen shoots that produce small, clustered flowers in early spring. The plant has a unique reproductive system, relying on wind pollination and producing seeds in small, capsule-like structures. Its botanical significance lies in its potential medicinal properties and its role in ecological studies of relic plant species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Prasoxylon alliaceum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
