                    <h1>Potamogeton × xinganensis</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × xinganensis, commonly known as the Xing'an hybrid pondweed, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Potamogeton perfoliatus and Potamogeton crispus.</p>
<p>It is a submerged aquatic plant characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often spirally arranged along the stem. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, typically found in freshwater habitats. It is native to China and thrives in slow-moving to still waters with moderate to high nutrient levels.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
