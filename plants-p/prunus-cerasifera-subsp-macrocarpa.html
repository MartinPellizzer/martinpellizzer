                    <h1>Prunus cerasifera subsp. macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Prunus cerasifera subsp.</p>
<p>macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited cherry or the common bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn and its clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The subspecies is notable for its larger, sweeter fruits compared to the typical Prunus cerasifera, which are often consumed by birds and small mammals. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
