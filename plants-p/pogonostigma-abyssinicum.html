<p>It is characterized by its intricate network of rhizines and a thallus that is typically greenish to brownish in color. The lichen forms dense mats on tree trunks and rocks, contributing to soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance, it plays a vital role in maintaining the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
