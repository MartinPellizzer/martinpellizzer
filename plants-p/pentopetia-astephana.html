                    <h1>Pentopetia astephana</h1>
<p>Pentopetia astephana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fig, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and unique, fig-like fruit that is typically green when mature. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowering and fruiting periods are closely tied to seasonal rainfall patterns, making it a sensitive indicator of climate change.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pentopetia astephana is considered vulnerable to environmental disturbances.</p>
