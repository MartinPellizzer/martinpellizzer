                    <h1>Paspalum tenue</h1>
<p>Paspalum tenue, commonly known as silky paspalum, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in summer. This plant thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Paspalum tenue is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
