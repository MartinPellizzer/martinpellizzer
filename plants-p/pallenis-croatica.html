The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological studies in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
