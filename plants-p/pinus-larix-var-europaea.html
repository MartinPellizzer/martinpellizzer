                    <h1>Pinus larix var. europaea</h1>
<p>Pinus larix var. europaea, commonly known as the European larch, is a deciduous conifer native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden and fall off in autumn, making it one of the few conifers with seasonal leaf loss. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>The European larch thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions across its native range.</p>
