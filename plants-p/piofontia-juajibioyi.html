                    <h1>Piofontia juajibioyi</h1>
<p>Piofontia juajibioyi, commonly known as the Huayna Picchu orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet and white petals, which are adapted for specific pollination by nocturnal insects. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically between 2,000 and 3,500 meters above sea level, where it requires cool, moist conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying biodiversity in Andean ecosystems.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial due to habitat loss and climate change threatening its survival.</p>
