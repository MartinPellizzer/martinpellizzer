                    <h1>Potamogeton × sterilis</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × sterilis, commonly known as the sterile pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant that occurs naturally in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Potamogetonaceae family and is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant is typically found in shallow lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers, where it can form dense underwater vegetation. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds, relying instead on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
<p>Its presence can influence water quality and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
