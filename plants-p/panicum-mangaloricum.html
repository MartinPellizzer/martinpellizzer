<p>Panicum mangaloricum, commonly known as the mangaloric grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils, often found in dune habitats and salt marshes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pink to reddish in color, which attract various pollinators. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sandy soils, making it ecologically important for coastal erosion control.</p>
<p>Panicum mangaloricum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
