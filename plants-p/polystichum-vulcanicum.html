<p>Polystichum vulcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the volcanic regions of Japan and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky or volcanic soils. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polystichum vulcanicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions.</p>
