                    <h1>Platanthera chlorantha f. grandiflora</h1>
<p>Platanthera chlorantha f. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered green orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees and rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
