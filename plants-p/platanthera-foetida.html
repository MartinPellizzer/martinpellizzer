                    <h1>Platanthera foetida</h1>
<p>Platanthera foetida, commonly known as the stinking ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish flowers, which are often described as resembling ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded habitats such as swamps and bogs, where it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are long and narrow, and it produces a distinctive, unpleasant odor that may aid in pollination by attracting certain insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Platanthera foetida is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
