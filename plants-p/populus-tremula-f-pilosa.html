                    <h1>Populus tremula f. pilosa</h1>
<p>Populus tremula f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy aspen, is a variant of the trembling aspen characterized by its dense, hairy foliage.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in temperate forested areas. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, downy texture that distinguishes it from other poplar species. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
