<p>Pfaffia paniculata f. lanceolata, commonly known as the Brazilian ginseng, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Pfaffia paniculata species.</p>
<p>It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant features lanceolate leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles. Its root system is highly valued for its potential medicinal properties, though research remains limited.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
