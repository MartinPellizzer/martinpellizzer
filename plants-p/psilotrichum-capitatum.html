                    <h1>Psilotrichum capitatum</h1>
<p>Psilotrichum capitatum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered with tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the reproductive organs. Psilotrichum capitatum thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and ancient lineage make it an important subject in the study of early plant evolution.</p>
