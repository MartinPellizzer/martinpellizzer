                    <h1>Phoradendron gundlachii</h1>
<p>Phoradendron gundlachii, commonly known as the Florida mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using its green stems. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the ecological dynamics of its host trees.</p>
