                    <h1>Pitcairnia neglecta</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia neglecta, commonly known as the neglected pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a common feature among bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia neglecta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
