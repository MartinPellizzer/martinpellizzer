<p>Parathesis, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a member of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils across temperate regions. The plant features basal leaves that are oval to lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. Its yellow flowers bloom in clusters, resembling dandelion flowers, but it is not related to the true dandelion.</p>
<p>Parathesis is often used in herbal medicine for its purported diuretic properties.</p>
