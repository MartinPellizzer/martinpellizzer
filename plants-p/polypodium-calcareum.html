                    <h1>Polypodium calcareum</h1>
<p>Polypodium calcareum, commonly known as the limestone fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks where it can access moisture and nutrients. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a narrow, elongated shape and a central vein. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium calcareum is well adapted to calcareous substrates, which contribute to its common name.</p>
