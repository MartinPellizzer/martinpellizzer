                    <h1>Potentilla gelida var. turczaninowiana</h1>
<p>Potentilla gelida var. turczaninowiana, commonly known as the Siberian cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh climates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it a resilient species adapted to extreme cold and limited nutrients.</p>
