                    <h1>Potentilla gaudinii f. astelligera</h1>
<p>Potentilla gaudinii f. astelligera, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the summer, adding a striking contrast to its silver-green foliage. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens.</p>
