                    <h1>Pouteria campechiana var. nervosa</h1>
<p>Pouteria campechiana var. nervosa, commonly known as the Mexican mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves with prominent veins, which give it its varietal name "nervosa.". The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, sweet, and fleshy fruits resembling small berries. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a significant resource in local economies.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
