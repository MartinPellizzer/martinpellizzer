<p>Polypodium menisciifolium, commonly known as the Meniscifoliate Shield Fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, shield-like structure. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a lush green appearance throughout the year.</p>
