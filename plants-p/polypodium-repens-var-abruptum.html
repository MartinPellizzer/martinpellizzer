<p>Polypodium repens var. abruptum, commonly known as the creeping polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, feather-like appearance, and they often have a glossy surface. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its abrupt, sudden changes in frond morphology, giving it its specific epithet.</p>
