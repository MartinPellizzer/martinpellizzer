                    <h1>Phippsia interior</h1>
<p>Phippsia interior, commonly known as the interior phippsia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, seed-like fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phippsia interior is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
