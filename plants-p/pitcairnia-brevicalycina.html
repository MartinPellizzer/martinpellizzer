                    <h1>Pitcairnia brevicalycina</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia brevicalycina, commonly known as the short calyx pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking, short-lived inflorescences with vibrant red flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is often covered in fine, silver-gray hairs, which help reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia brevicalycina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
