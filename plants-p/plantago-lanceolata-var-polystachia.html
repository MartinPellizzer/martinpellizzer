                    <h1>Plantago lanceolata var. polystachia</h1>
<p>Plantago lanceolata var. polystachia, commonly known as the hairy plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>This variant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
