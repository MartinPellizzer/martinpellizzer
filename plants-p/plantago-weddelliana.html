                    <h1>Plantago weddelliana</h1>
<p>Plantago weddelliana, commonly known as Antarctic plantain, is a perennial herb native to the cold regions of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is adapted to extreme environments, including the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic islands, where it thrives in rocky and barren soils. The plant has a compact rosette structure with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, typical of the Plantaginaceae family.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in low-nutrient, high-salinity soils makes it an important component of polar ecosystems.</p>
