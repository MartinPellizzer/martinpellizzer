                    <h1>Pitcairnia microcalyx var. schlimii</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia microcalyx var. schlimii, commonly known as the Schlim's pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, a common adaptation in its native habitat. The plant produces striking, violet-blue inflorescences that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
