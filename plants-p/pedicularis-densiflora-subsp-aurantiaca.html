<p>Pedicularis densiflora subsp.</p>
<p>aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. This subspecies is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers, which are clustered in dense inflorescences along the stems.</p>
<p>The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
