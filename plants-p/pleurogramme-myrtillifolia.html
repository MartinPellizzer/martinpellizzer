                    <h1>Pleurogramme myrtillifolia</h1>
<p>Pleurogramme myrtillifolia, commonly known as the blueberry fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to freshwater environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are often tinged with a bluish hue, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Its fronds are usually divided into several pairs of leaflets, and it produces small, inconspicuous spores rather than flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
