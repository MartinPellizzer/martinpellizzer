<p>Priestleya hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy priestleya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Agavaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette-forming structure with thick, fleshy leaves covered in fine, hair-like structures. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow and are borne on a tall, branched inflorescence.</p>
<p>Priestleya hirsuta is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, storing water in its leaves and reducing water loss through its hairy surface.</p>
