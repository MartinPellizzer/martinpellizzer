                    <h1>Potamogeton heterophyllus f. minimus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton heterophyllus f. minimus, commonly known as the dwarf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often ribbon-like in appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution and eutrophication.</p>
