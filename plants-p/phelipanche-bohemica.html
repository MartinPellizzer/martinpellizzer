                    <h1>Phelipanche bohemica</h1>
<p>Phelipanche bohemica, commonly known as the Bohemian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellowish, thread-like stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. It typically infests the roots of various herbaceous plants, including crops like wheat and barley.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural systems if left unchecked.</p>
