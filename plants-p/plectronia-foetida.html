                    <h1>Plectronia foetida</h1>
<p>Plectronia foetida, commonly known as the stink plant, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, simple, and usually ovate or elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pink, followed by small, round, fleshy fruits. Its leaves and stems emit a strong, unpleasant odor when crushed, which is a characteristic feature of the species.</p>
<p>This botanical trait is thought to deter herbivores and may also play a role in its ecological interactions.</p>
