                    <h1>Periphragmos dependens</h1>
<p>Periphragmos dependens, commonly known as the hanging periphragm, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that hang gracefully from its stems, giving it a unique and elegant appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests where humidity is high. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Periphragmos dependens is considered a conservation concern.</p>
