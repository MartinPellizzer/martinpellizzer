<p>Potentilla anserina subsp.</p>
<p>groenlandica, commonly known as Greenland bentgrasses, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, oval leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its role as a pioneer species in harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>
