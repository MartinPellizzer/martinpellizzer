                    <h1>Pedicularis semitorta var. semitorta</h1>
<p>Pedicularis semitorta var. semitorta, commonly known as the dwarf monkey orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the alpine regions of Europe, particularly the Pyrenees and the Alps. This plant is characterized by its compact stature, with hairy stems and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats at high elevations.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and pollination strategy make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
