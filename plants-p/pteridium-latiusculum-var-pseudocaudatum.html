<p>Pteridium latiusculum var. pseudocaudatum, commonly known as the false horse-tail fern, is a variant of the common bracken fern.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. The plant has a rhizomatous structure with fronds that are usually dark green and have a leathery texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
