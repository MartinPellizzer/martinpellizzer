<p>Pieris amamioshimensis, commonly known as the Amami mitsumata, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the Amami Islands in Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
