<p>Panicularia canadensis, commonly known as Canada panicled grass, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces panicles—branched inflorescences—that are often tinged with red or purple, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes and stream banks.</p>
<p>Panicularia canadensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
