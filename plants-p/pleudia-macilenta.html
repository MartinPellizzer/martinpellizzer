                    <h1>Pleudia macilenta</h1>
<p>Pleudia macilenta, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, thin, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting specific pollinators like moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pleudia macilenta is considered critically endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
