                    <h1>Primula halleri</h1>
<p>Primula halleri, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features basal leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in cold, arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, usually blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forested slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
