                    <h1>Poa repens</h1>
<p>Poa repens, commonly known as creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It features rhizomatous growth that allows it to spread horizontally, forming dense mats of vegetation. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is commonly used in lawns and as a ground cover.</p>
