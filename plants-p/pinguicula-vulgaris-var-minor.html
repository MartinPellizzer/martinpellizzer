                    <h1>Pinguicula vulgaris var. minor</h1>
<p>Pinguicula vulgaris var. minor, commonly known as the lesser butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wet meadows. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-white, with a subtle fragrance.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to absorb nutrients from captured prey, adapting to its harsh, low-nutrient habitat.</p>
