<p>Panicum glutinosum, commonly known as sticky panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, sticky coating. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist to wet soils.</p>
<p>Panicum glutinosum is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife.</p>
