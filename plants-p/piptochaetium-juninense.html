<p>Piptochaetium juninense, commonly known as the Jun√≠n grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Peru and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both sterile and fertile florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to cool, temperate climates with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
