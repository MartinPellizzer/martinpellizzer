<p>Phegopteris obtusiloba, commonly known as the broad-lobed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces floating fronds with broad, lobed leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to water quality.</p>
