                    <h1>Pitcairnia caduciflora</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia caduciflora, commonly known as the pink pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of elongated, waxy leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers that emerge from the leaf rosette, often in a showy inflorescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
