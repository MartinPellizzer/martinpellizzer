<p>It features wiry, prostrate stems that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive, spiny appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers clustered in dense spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, with a deep root system and the ability to store water in its stems.</p>
