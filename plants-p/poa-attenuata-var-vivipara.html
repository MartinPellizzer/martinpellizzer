                    <h1>Poa attenuata var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Poa attenuata var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments such as meadows and woodland edges. One distinctive feature is its ability to produce viviparous shoots, which can root and grow independently, aiding in its spread.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats.</p>
