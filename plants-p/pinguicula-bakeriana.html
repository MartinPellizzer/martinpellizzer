                    <h1>Pinguicula bakeriana</h1>
<p>Pinguicula bakeriana, commonly known as the Baker's butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the high altitudes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant's leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps in water retention and enhances its ability to capture prey. It blooms with small, pink or purple flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>Pinguicula bakeriana is adapted to nutrient-poor environments, making it an efficient predator in its native habitat.</p>
