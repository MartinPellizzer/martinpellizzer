<p>Prasophyllum macrostachyum var. ringens, commonly known as the Ringed Leek Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of pale green to brownish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as heathlands and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
