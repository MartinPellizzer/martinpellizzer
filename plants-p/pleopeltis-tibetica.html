                    <h1>Pleopeltis tibetica</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are adapted to the harsh, cold climates of its habitat. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or tree trunks, where it can absorb moisture from the air. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Pleopeltis tibetica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized horticultural settings.</p>
