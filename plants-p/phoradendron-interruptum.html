                    <h1>Phoradendron interruptum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron interruptum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it produces its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using its leaves. The plant's berries are an important food source for birds, which then disperse the seeds to new host trees. Its parasitic nature and unique reproductive strategy make it an ecologically significant species in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant is also associated with the holiday tradition of decorating with its evergreen foliage.</p>
