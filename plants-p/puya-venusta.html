<p>Puya venusta, commonly known as the Andean torch or the royal torch, is a striking plant native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the bromeliad family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect water. The plant produces tall, showy inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and covered in a waxy cuticle to retain moisture in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Puya venusta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
