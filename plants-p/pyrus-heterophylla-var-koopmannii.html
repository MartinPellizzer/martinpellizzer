<p>Pyrus heterophylla var. koopmannii, commonly known as the Koopmann's pear, is a variant of the heterophylla pear, native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its alternate, often lobed leaves that vary in shape depending on light exposure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for cultivation in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is often grown in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
