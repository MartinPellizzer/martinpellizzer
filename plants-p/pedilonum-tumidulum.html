                    <h1>Pedilonum tumidulum</h1>
<p>Pedilonum tumidulum, commonly known as the swollen foot lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, thick, leaf-like structure with a pale green to yellowish upper surface and a darker, more leathery underside. The thallus is loosely attached to the substrate, often growing on soil, rocks, or tree bark. Its reproductive structures, called soredia, are scattered across the surface, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
