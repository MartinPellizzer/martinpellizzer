                    <h1>Pinus vilmoriniana</h1>
<p>Pinus vilmoriniana, commonly known as the Vilmorin's pine, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the mountainous regions of central China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are initially yellowish but turn reddish-brown as they mature. It thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
