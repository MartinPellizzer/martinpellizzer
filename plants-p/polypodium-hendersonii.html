                    <h1>Polypodium hendersonii</h1>
<p>Polypodium hendersonii, commonly known as Henderson's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure. The plant typically grows on rock surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous areas. Its rhizome is thick and wiry, supporting the growth of its dark green, bi-lobed leaves.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
