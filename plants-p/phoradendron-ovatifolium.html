                    <h1>Phoradendron ovatifolium</h1>
<p>Phoradendron ovatifolium, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, green leaves that perform photosynthesis, while its flowers are typically white or greenish-white. It is well-known for its sticky berries, which are often associated with holiday traditions.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves birds dispersing its seeds, which then germinate on the branches of new host trees.</p>
