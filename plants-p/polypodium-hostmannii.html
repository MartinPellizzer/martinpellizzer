<p>Polypodium hostmannii, commonly known as the Hostmann's fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on rock surfaces or tree trunks in cool, humid environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure that allows it to thrive in shaded, rocky habitats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique, linear pattern on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and climate change, Polypodium hostmannii faces significant threats to its survival.</p>
