<p>Poa yezoalpina, commonly known as the Yezo alpine grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it forms dense, low-growing tufts. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Poa yezoalpina is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in alpine regions.</p>
