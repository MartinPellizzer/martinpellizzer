                    <h1>Phanera dubia</h1>
<p>Phanera dubia, commonly known as the rare ghost orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake, as it lacks true roots. Phanera dubia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
