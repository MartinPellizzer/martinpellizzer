                    <h1>Poa ruwenzoriensis</h1>
<p>Poa ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Rwenzori Mountains in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the rugged, alpine terrain of its native habitat. The plant typically grows in dense tussocks, forming a mat-like structure that helps stabilize the soil in its harsh environment. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that reflects its adaptation to high-altitude light conditions.</p>
<p>Poa ruwenzoriensis plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and forage for wildlife in its native range.</p>
