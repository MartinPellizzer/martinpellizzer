                    <h1>Potamogeton lucens var. ovalifolius</h1>
<p>Potamogeton lucens var. ovalifolius, commonly known as the oval-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater ecosystems in North America.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that are typically oval in shape, arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which are often submerged or partially emergent. It plays an important role in aquatic habitats by providing food and shelter for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from other forms of Potamogeton lucens by its distinctly oval leaf shape and growth habits.</p>
