<p>Polystichum inerme, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, upright growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that have a distinctive silvery sheen on their undersides. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in rows along the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Polystichum inerme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture for its hardy and low-maintenance nature.</p>
