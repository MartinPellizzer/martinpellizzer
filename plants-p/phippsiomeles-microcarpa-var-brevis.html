                    <h1>Phippsiomeles microcarpa var. brevis</h1>
<p>Phippsiomeles microcarpa var. brevis, commonly known as the dwarf sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions makes it a resilient choice for landscaping in challenging environments.</p>
