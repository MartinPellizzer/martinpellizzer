                    <h1>Phalaenopsis pulcherrima var. regnieriana</h1>
<p>Phalaenopsis pulcherrima var. regnieriana, commonly known as the Regnier's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a subtle fragrance. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, producing new pseudobulbs and leaves from the base. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its longevity and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to bloom repeatedly.</p>
