<p>Pedicularis centranthera, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded structure. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range.</p>
