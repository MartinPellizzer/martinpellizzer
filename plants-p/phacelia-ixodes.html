                    <h1>Phacelia ixodes</h1>
<p>Phacelia ixodes, commonly known as the desert phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Phacelia ixodes is also known for its role in supporting pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers.</p>
