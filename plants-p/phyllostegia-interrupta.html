                    <h1>Phyllostegia interrupta</h1>
<p>Phyllostegia interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily oaks, through its haustelia, which penetrate the host's vascular system to absorb water and nutrients. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various insects and birds.</p>
