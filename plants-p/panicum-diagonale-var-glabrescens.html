<p>Panicum diagonale var. glabrescens, commonly known as the silky panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces delicate, panicle-like inflorescences with small, spikelet-bearing branches. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fine texture and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps.</p>
