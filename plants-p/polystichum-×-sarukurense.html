                    <h1>Polystichum × sarukurense</h1>
<p>Polystichum × sarukurense, commonly known as the hybrid Japanese forest fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Polystichum setiferum and Polystichum polyblepharum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, elongated shape and a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodlands and rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses as a decorative plant.</p>
