                    <h1>Petradoria pumila</h1>
<p>Petradoria pumila, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats in the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has a basal rosette structure, allowing it to store water efficiently in its leaves and stems. Its leaves are typically opposite and covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Petradoria pumila is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices.</p>
