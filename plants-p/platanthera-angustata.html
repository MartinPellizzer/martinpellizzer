<p>Platanthera angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh-orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and bogs in North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that bear pale green to yellowish flowers arranged in a spike. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is typical for many orchid species.</p>
<p>Platanthera angustata thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora.</p>
