                    <h1>Pedicularis resupinata f. gigantea</h1>
<p>Pedicularis resupinata f. gigantea, commonly known as the giant lady's slipper, is a striking member of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pinkish-purple coloration. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas and meadows.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable species in botanical studies.</p>
