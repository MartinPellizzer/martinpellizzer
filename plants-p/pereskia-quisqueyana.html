                    <h1>Pereskia quisqueyana</h1>
<p>Pereskia quisqueyana, commonly known as the Cuban cactus or the cactus tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba, and is characterized by its thick, woody stems that resemble tree trunks. The plant has large, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a striking visual element to its appearance.</p>
<p>Despite its cactus-like appearance, it is not a true cactus but is closely related to other cacti in the family.</p>
