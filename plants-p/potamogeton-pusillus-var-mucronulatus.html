<p>Potamogeton pusillus var. mucronulatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter wide, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
