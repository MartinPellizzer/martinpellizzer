<p>Phialodiscus bancoensis, commonly known as the African water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nympheaceae and is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in the late afternoon. The plant has a short stem with a spongy, air-filled structure that helps it float on the water's surface. Its flowers are typically pink or white and attract pollinators such as bees and beetles.</p>
<p>Phialodiscus bancoensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic organisms and contributing to water oxygenation.</p>
