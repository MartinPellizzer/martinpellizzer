                    <h1>Pteridium capense var. densum</h1>
<p>Pteridium capense var. densum, commonly known as the dense fern, is a variant of the common bracken fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a robust, evergreen fern characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to spread rapidly through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The dense frond structure provides habitat for various small organisms, contributing to its ecological significance in its native range.</p>
