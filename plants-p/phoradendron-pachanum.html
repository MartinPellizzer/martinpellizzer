                    <h1>Phoradendron pachanum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron pachanum, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Andes, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Andean region.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are covered in a dense layer of spongy, white tissue. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals. Its life cycle involves birds dispersing its seeds, which then germinate on the bark of host trees.</p>
<p>This unique relationship with its host is a key feature of its botanical ecology.</p>
