                    <h1>Psilotrichum densiflorum</h1>
<p>Psilotrichum densiflorum, commonly known as the dense-flowered psilotrichum, is a member of the Psilotaceae family, a group of primitive vascular plants.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, fern-like morphology with small, scale-like leaves and a lack of true roots. The plant produces abundant, dense clusters of tiny, greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its unique structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
