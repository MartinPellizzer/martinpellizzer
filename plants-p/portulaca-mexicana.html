                    <h1>Portulaca mexicana</h1>
<p>Portulaca mexicana, commonly known as Mexican moss or common purslane, is a low-growing annual plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctophily. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Portulaca mexicana is often found in gardens and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil.</p>
