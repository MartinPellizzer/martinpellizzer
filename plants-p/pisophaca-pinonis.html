                    <h1>Pisophaca pinonis</h1>
<p>Pisophaca pinonis, commonly known as the pine needle gall fly, is a small insect that induces the formation of galls on the needles of certain pine trees.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical significance lies in its role as a host for this insect, which causes the development of abnormal growths on the foliage. These galls are formed when the insect's larvae secrete substances that stimulate plant cell proliferation. The plant's response to the infestation results in the formation of hardened, seed-like structures that protect the developing insect.</p>
<p>This interaction highlights the complex relationships between plants and their herbivorous invertebrates.</p>
