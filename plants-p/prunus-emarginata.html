                    <h1>Prunus emarginata</h1>
<p>Prunus emarginata, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red, fuzzy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Due to its cold-hardiness, it is often cultivated in temperate climates for both its aesthetic value and edible fruits.</p>
