                    <h1>Pisum sativum var. saccharatum</h1>
<p>Pisum sativum var. saccharatum, commonly known as sugar pea, is a variant of the common pea that is characterized by its sweet, edible pods.</p>
<p>Unlike typical garden peas, sugar peas are cultivated primarily for their pods rather than their seeds, which are often inedible or less palatable. The plant produces tendrils and compound leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family, and thrives in temperate climates. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive flowers and vigorous growth habit.</p>
<p>The pods are typically harvested before they fully mature, ensuring a sweet and tender texture.</p>
