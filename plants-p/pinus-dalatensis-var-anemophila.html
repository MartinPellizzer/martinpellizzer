                    <h1>Pinus dalatensis var. anemophila</h1>
<p>Pinus dalatensis var. anemophila, commonly known as the Anemophilous Pine, is a rare and endangered variant of the Dalat Pine.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of Vietnam, particularly in the Central Highlands. This variant is characterized by its slender, upward-curving cones and needle-like leaves that are adapted to the cool, moist climate of its habitat. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation priority.</p>
