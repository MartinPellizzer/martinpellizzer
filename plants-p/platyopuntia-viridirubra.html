<p>Platyopuntia viridirubra, commonly known as the green-red prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, greenish-red stems that are covered in spines and are often segmented. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor.</p>
<p>Platyopuntia viridirubra is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and minimizing water loss through its waxy surface.</p>
