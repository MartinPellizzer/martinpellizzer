                    <h1>Paepalanthus pallidus</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus pallidus, commonly known as the pale sun cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with pale green to yellowish stems that are ribbed and covered in small, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise spiny appearance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
