<p>Polypogon elongatus var. patagonicus, commonly known as Patagonian slender grass, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, where it forms dense mats or tufts. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in arid regions.</p>
