                    <h1>Poa poophagorum var. lanata</h1>
<p>Poa poophagorum var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly meadow grass, is a variant of the meadow grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and the presence of silky, lanate (woolly) hairs on its leaves and stems, which provide insulation and aid in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats such as dunes, gravelly slopes, and sandy soils. The plant is adapted to low precipitation environments and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important species for studying plant adaptations to harsh climates.</p>
