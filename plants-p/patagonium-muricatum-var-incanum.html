<p>Patagonium muricatum var. incanum, commonly known as the white-furred mountain apple, is a variant of the mountain apple tree native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white-gray pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance.

Its growth is typically found in high-altitude areas with cool, humid climates.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its potential culinary uses.</p>
