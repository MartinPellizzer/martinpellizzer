<p>Porlieria hygrometra, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, aiding in water filtration and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately divided, with a feathery appearance that enhances its ornamental value in aquatic gardens.</p>
