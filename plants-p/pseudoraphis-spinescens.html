                    <h1>Pseudoraphis spinescens</h1>
<p>Pseudoraphis spinescens, commonly known as the spiny cypress, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which are often mistaken for leaves. Its woody stems are covered in thick, leathery bark that provides protection against drought and herbivory.</p>
<p>Pseudoraphis spinescens is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
