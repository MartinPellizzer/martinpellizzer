<p>Pinus elegans, commonly known as the silver fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and its long, soft, needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Pinus elegans thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the Andean ecosystem.</p>
