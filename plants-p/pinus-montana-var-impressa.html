                    <h1>Pinus montana var. impressa</h1>
<p>Pinus montana var. impressa, commonly known as the Alpine white pine, is a rare and distinctive variant of the white pine species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and a conical shape that becomes more rounded with age. The needles are typically shorter and more rigid compared to other pine species, and they often have a bluish-gray hue. This variety thrives in high-altitude environments, such as mountainous regions, where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
