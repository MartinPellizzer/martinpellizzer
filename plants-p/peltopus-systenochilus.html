<p>Peltopus systenochilus, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Peltopus systenochilus is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
