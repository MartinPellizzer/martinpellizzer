                    <h1>Pedicularis rigidiformis</h1>
<p>Pedicularis rigidiformis, commonly known as the rigid horned orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its unique, often strikingly shaped flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive horn-like structure on the lower petal, which is a key feature for pollination.</p>
