                    <h1>Phoradendron boacoi</h1>
<p>Phoradendron boacoi, commonly known as the Boaco mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of trees in the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaraceae family and relies on its host for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis to some extent. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that consume the berries, facilitating its spread to new host trees.</p>
<p>The Boaco mistletoe plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree health and supporting local wildlife.</p>
