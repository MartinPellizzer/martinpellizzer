<p>Polypodium flabellivenium, commonly known as the fan-leaf wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a delicate, leathery texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to thrive in low-light conditions makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
