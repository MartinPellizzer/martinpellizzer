                    <h1>Phoradendron enckeifolium</h1>
<p>Phoradendron enckeifolium, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are consumed by birds that disperse the seeds.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important ecological role in its ecosystem, supporting various wildlife species.</p>
