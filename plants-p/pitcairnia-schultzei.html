                    <h1>Pitcairnia schultzei</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia schultzei, commonly known as the showy pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, a common adaptation in its native habitat. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing brightly colored, long-lasting flowers, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia schultzei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to warm, humid environments.</p>
