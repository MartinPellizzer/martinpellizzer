                    <h1>Pleocnemia bakeri</h1>
<p>Pleocnemia bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's pleocnemia, is a rare and delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense forests or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
