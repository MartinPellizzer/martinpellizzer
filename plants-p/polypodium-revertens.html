<p>Polypodium revertens, commonly known as the false fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
