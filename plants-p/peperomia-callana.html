<p>Peperomia callana, commonly known as the silver peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to South America.</p>
<p>It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically silver or gray-green in color, with a textured surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, which are usually hidden among the foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Peperomia callana is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
