                    <h1>Potentilla crantzii var. ternata</h1>
<p>Potentilla crantzii var. ternata, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features wiry, arching stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats or colonies. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in cymes and attract pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically narrow, elliptic to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
