<p>Pteris dolabriformis, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately compound, with serrated margins and a distinctive, almost sword-like appearance.</p>
