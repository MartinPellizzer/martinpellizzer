                    <h1>Phoradendron microphyllum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron microphyllum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. It is native to various regions in the Americas and is known for its unique symbiotic relationship with its host.</p>
<p>Its presence can affect the health of the host tree, sometimes leading to decline or death.</p>
