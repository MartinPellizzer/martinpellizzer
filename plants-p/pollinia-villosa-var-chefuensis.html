                    <h1>Pollinia villosa var. chefuensis</h1>
<p>Pollinia villosa var. chefuensis, commonly known as the Chefum pollinia, is a rare orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy pollinia that are typically attached to a slender, fleshy viscidium. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinct, fragrant odor, which attracts specific pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
