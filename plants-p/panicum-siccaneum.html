<p>Panicum siccaneum, commonly known as the dry grass or sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, pale brown spikelets that are typically wind-dispersed, aiding in its propagation across sandy or rocky soils. Panicum siccaneum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
