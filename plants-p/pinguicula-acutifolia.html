<p>Pinguicula acutifolia, commonly known as the acute-leaved butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Pinguicula acutifolia is characterized by its ability to digest captured prey, providing it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
