<p>Psittacanthus complanatus, commonly known as the flat-leaf staghorn fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its flat, broad fronds that resemble the shape of a staghorn. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are typically found on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to humid, shaded environments.</p>
