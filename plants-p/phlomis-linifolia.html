                    <h1>Phlomis linifolia</h1>
<p>Phlomis linifolia, commonly known as woolly mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Its common name reflects the soft, woolly texture of its foliage, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
