                    <h1>Picea chihuahuana var. martinezii</h1>
<p>Picea chihuahuana var. martinezii, commonly known as the Chihuahua fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are dark green and slightly curved. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often growing in dense forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
