<p>Phlomis pungens subsp.</p>
<p>laxiflora, commonly known as the looseflower phlomis, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and the plant is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or well-drained soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to other Phlomis species, but it is distinguished by its more loosely arranged flower heads.</p>
