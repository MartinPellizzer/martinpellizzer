                    <h1>Picea excelsa var. tabuliformis</h1>
<p>Picea excelsa var. tabuliformis, commonly known as the Himalayan fir, is a variant of the white fir native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender form and dense, conical crown, which helps it withstand harsh mountain conditions. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are dark green and slightly curved, providing a striking visual contrast against the rocky terrain. Its cones are typically slender and hang downward, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing mountainous soils and its potential use in horticulture.</p>
