                    <h1>Phyllopodium capitatum</h1>
<p>Phyllopodium capitatum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains the plant's spores. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Phyllopodium capitatum has a long evolutionary history, dating back to the Paleozoic era, and plays a role in soil stabilization and ecosystem dynamics.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and ancient lineage make it an important subject in the study of plant evolution and paleobotany.</p>
