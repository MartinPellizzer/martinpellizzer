<p>Pinus laricio var. leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaved stone pine, is a variant of the stone pine native to the Alps and Carpathian regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more pointed than those of the typical stone pine. The cones of this variety are often smaller and more compact, with a distinctive reddish-brown color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in Mediterranean and European horticulture.</p>
