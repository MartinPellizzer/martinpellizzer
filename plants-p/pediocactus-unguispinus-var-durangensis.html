<p>Pediocactus unguispinus var. durangensis, commonly known as the Durango prickly pear, is a cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates.</p>
