                    <h1>Pontederia eriantha</h1>
<p>Pontederia eriantha, commonly known as the broad-leaved water hyacinth, is a semi-aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface, often forming dense mats. The plant produces showy, lavender-colored flowers with three petals and three sepals, typical of the Pontederiaceae family. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in wetlands and ponds.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in non-native regions, outcompeting native species for resources.</p>
