<p>Pteris prionitis, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread across the forest floor. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Pteris prionitis is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
