<p>Pyrrhocactus subaianus, commonly known as the Arabian torch cactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, columnar stems that are often reddish or purple in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of its stems. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
