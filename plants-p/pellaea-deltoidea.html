<p>Pellaea deltoidea, commonly known as the delta fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, deltoid-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and often have a waxy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Pellaea deltoidea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions.</p>
