<p>Phreatia cladophylax, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant typically produces a single, upright flower spike bearing a single, showy orchid flower with a greenish-yellow lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for both horticulturists and botanists.</p>
