                    <h1>Polystichum lonchitis var. scopulinum</h1>
<p>Polystichum lonchitis var. scopulinum, commonly known as the yellow wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the forests of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often tinged with yellow or golden hues, especially in the young leaves. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in forest ecosystems.</p>
