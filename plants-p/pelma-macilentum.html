<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces delicate, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
