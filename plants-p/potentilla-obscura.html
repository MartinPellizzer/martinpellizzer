<p>Potentilla obscura, commonly known as the dark potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically borne on slender, branching stems. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
