<p>Pharmacosycea mexicana, commonly known as Mexican ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent, and often bioluminescent flowers that emit a faint glow at night. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical significance lies in its unusual morphology and potential medicinal properties, though research on its chemical composition remains limited.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
