                    <h1>Pseudolachnostoma ecuadorense</h1>
<p>Pseudolachnostoma ecuadorense, commonly known as the Ecuadorian lichen, is a specialized symbiotic organism that forms a lichen composite with a fungal partner.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in the humid forests of Ecuador, where it thrives on tree bark and rock surfaces. The plant's structure consists of a fungal mycelium that envelops and supports a photosynthetic algal partner. It plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
