                    <h1>Pedicularis mychophila</h1>
<p>Pedicularis mychophila, commonly known as the fairy slipper or ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, often with a distinctive slipper-like pouch at the base. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as mountainous regions and is often found in association with coniferous forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pedicularis mychophila is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
