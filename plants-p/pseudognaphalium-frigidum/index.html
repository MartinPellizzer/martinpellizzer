                            <h1>Pseudognaphalium Frigidum</h1>
<p>Frostweed, scientifically known as Pseudognaphalium frigidum, is a hardy perennial plant that thrives in cold climates. It is commonly found in moist, open areas such as meadows and stream banks in northern regions. This plant is notable for its ability to withstand frost and snow, making it a symbol of resilience in harsh environments. Its unique appearance, with silvery-white leaves and clusters of small yellow flowers, adds to its visual appeal. Frostweed also plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
