                    <h1>Pharseophora coriacea</h1>
<p>Pharseophora coriacea, commonly known as the rough pharseophora, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a distinctive, rough texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the cooler months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to shallow soil layers, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Pharseophora coriacea is often found in open grasslands and rocky outcrops, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
