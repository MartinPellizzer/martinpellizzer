<p>Poa alpina subsp.</p>
<p>subalpina, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in alpine and subalpine zones at high elevations. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in rocky or barren habitats.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous short, awned florets, typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
