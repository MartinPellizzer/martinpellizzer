                    <h1>Pedicularis petitmenginii var. dissecta</h1>
<p>Pedicularis petitmenginii var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and specialized growth habits.</p>
<p>This perennial herb is native to alpine regions of Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and the Alps, where it thrives in rocky and nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically pink to purple, with a distinctive spurred petal that aids in pollination by specific insect species. The plant exhibits a rosette growth form, with basal leaves that are finely dissected, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
