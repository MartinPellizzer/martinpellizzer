                    <h1>Polycarena discolor</h1>
<p>Polycarena discolor, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pinkish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has long, slender stems and produces small, clustered leaves that help it absorb moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Polycarena discolor is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
