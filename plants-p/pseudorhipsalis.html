                    <h1>Pseudorhipsalis</h1>
<p>Pseudorhipsalis, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leaf-like stems that are often mistaken for leaves, which are actually modified stems adapted for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Pseudorhipsalis thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its stems makes it drought-tolerant, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
