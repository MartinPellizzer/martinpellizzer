                            <h1>Poinsettia Havanensis</h1>
<p>Havana poinsettia, scientifically known as Poinsettia havanensis, is a strikingly beautiful plant native to the tropical regions of Cuba. With its vibrant red and green foliage, it stands out as a unique species within the Euphorbiaceae family. This plant is often mistaken for the more common poinsettia, but it possesses distinct characteristics that set it apart. Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after specimen for collectors and gardeners alike. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively rare and underappreciated in the global plant world.</p>
