                    <h1>Pyrus × sverigensis</h1>
<p>Pyrus × sverigensis, commonly known as the Swedish pear, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Pyrus pyraster and Pyrus communis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ornamental fruits and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than its edible qualities. The plant typically grows as a deciduous shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a serrated margin, and it produces white to pale yellow flowers in spring.</p>
<p>The Swedish pear is native to southern Sweden and is well adapted to temperate climates.</p>
