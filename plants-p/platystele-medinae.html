                    <h1>Platystele medinae</h1>
<p>Platystele medinae, commonly known as the Medina's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its small, delicate leaves and a single, slender stem that produces a single, fragrant flower. Native to the cloud forests of Colombia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with high atmospheric moisture. The plant is notable for its unique morphology, including a specialized root system adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Platystele medinae is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
