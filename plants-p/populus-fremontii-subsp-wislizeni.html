<p>Populus fremontii subsp.</p>
<p>wislizeni, commonly known as the Fremont's cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and catkin-like flowers that appear in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in riparian zones, often along rivers and streams, and has a shallow root system that helps stabilize stream banks. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, facilitating its spread along waterways.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-adapted to arid environments and plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and ecosystem health.</p>
