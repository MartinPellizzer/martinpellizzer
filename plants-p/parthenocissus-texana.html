<p>Parthenocissus texana, commonly known as the Texas ivy, is a climbing vine native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for covering walls, trellises, and fences.</p>
<p>However, it can be invasive in some regions if not properly managed.</p>
