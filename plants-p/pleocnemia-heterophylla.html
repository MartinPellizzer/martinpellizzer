                    <h1>Pleocnemia heterophylla</h1>
<p>Pleocnemia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable pleocnemia, is a unique fern species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with fronds that can be either pinnate or digitate depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky outcrops. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>The species exhibits a range of morphological adaptations that allow it to thrive in diverse microhabitats.</p>
