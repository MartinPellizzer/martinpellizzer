                    <h1>Phymatopteris hastata f. pygmaea</h1>
<p>Phymatopteris hastata f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf moonwort, is a compact fern species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>The fern's compact size and unique morphology make it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
