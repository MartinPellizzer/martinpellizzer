<p>Pteris longibrachiata, commonly known as the long-armed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread across moist environments. Its sori, which are clusters of sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Pteris longibrachiata thrives in shaded, humid conditions and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest floors.</p>
