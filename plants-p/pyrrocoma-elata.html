<p>Pyrrocoma elata, commonly known as the slender pygmyweed, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, and its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences. Pyrrocoma elata is often found in crevices and on slopes, where it forms dense mats that help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
