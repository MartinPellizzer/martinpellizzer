                    <h1>Pitcairnia klabochiana</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia klabochiana, commonly known as the Klaboch's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, a common adaptation in its native habitat. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with bright red bracts that attract pollinators. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
