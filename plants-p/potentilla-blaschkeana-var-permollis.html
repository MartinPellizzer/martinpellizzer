<p>Potentilla blaschkeana var. permollis, commonly known as the silky cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely hairy, silvery-green foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, adding ornamental value to its habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
