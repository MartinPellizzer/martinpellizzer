                    <h1>Pedicularis verticillata f. exaphylla</h1>
<p>Pedicularis verticillata f. exaphylla, commonly known as the showy winter coralroot, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>This herbaceous plant is characterized by its unique, branched stem and clusters of showy, pinkish-red to orange flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. The leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
