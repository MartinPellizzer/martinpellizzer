                    <h1>Poa pauciflora</h1>
<p>Poa pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its small, spikelet-like flowers are usually blue or purple, and it blooms during the cooler months.</p>
<p>Poa pauciflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems.</p>
