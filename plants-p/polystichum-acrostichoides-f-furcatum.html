                    <h1>Polystichum acrostichoides f. furcatum</h1>
<p>Polystichum acrostichoides f. furcatum, commonly known as the forked shield fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds that often exhibit a forked or branched appearance, giving it its specific epithet "furcatum.". The fronds are typically dark green and leathery, with a rough, serrated margin. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris genus to which it belongs.</p>
