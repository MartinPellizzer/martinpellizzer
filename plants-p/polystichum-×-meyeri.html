                    <h1>Polystichum × meyeri</h1>
<p>Polystichum × meyeri, commonly known as the Meyer's wood fern, is a hybrid fern species that combines traits from its parent species, Polystichum acutifolium and Polystichum setiferum.</p>
<p>It is a hardy, evergreen plant that thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. The plant features robust, arching fronds with a dark green color and a serrated edge. Its fertile fronds produce spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Polystichum × meyeri is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to add texture to shaded landscapes.</p>
