<p>Pterostylis readii, commonly known as the Read's hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, hood-like floral structure that resembles a small insect, aiding in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. The plant typically grows to a height of about 15â€“30 centimeters and produces a single, greenish-yellow flower with a prominent hood. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in understorey habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
