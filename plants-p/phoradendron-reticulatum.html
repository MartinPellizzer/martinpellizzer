                    <h1>Phoradendron reticulatum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron reticulatum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. Its parasitic nature allows it to thrive without soil, relying entirely on its host for survival.</p>
<p>Due to its unique growth habit and ecological role, it plays a significant part in forest ecosystems.</p>
