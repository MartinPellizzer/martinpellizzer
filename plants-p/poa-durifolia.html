                    <h1>Poa durifolia</h1>
<p>Poa durifolia, commonly known as the hardleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, Poa durifolia is sometimes used in native plant landscaping.</p>
