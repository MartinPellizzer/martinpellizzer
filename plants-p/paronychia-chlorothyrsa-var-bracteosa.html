                    <h1>Paronychia chlorothyrsa var. bracteosa</h1>
<p>Paronychia chlorothyrsa var. bracteosa, commonly known as the bracteosa sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky habitats in western North America.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer. Its stems are prostrate and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its presence of bract-like structures at the base of the flower clusters.</p>
