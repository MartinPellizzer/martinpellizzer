                    <h1>Plectrurus discolor</h1>
<p>Plectrurus discolor, commonly known as the discolor gecko, is a species of lizard native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gekkonidae and is characterized by its distinctive coloration, which includes a mix of gray, brown, and pale yellow hues. The plant aspect of this species is not applicable, as Plectrurus discolor is an animal, not a plant. Therefore, there are no botanical features to describe.</p>
