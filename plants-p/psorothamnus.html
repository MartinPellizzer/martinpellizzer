                    <h1>Psorothamnus</h1>
<p>Psorothamnus, commonly known as the desert broom, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>These shrubs typically have woody stems and small, often gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The flowers are usually yellow or cream-colored, clustered in dense, branched inflorescences, and bloom in spring. Psorothamnus species are drought-tolerant and play a role in stabilizing sandy soils in their native habitats.</p>
<p>Their ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various desert wildlife.</p>
