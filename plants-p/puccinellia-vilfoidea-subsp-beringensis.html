<p>Puccinellia vilfoidea subsp.</p>
<p>beringensis, commonly known as Bering's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Asia. It typically grows in dry, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitats and is an important component of tundra and steppe ecosystems.</p>
