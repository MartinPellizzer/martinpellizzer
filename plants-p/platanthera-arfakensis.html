                    <h1>Platanthera arfakensis</h1>
<p>Platanthera arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfakensis Lady's-tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its distinctive, fragrant, white to pale yellow flower spikes. The plant typically blooms during the late summer months, producing elongated, spiral-shaped flowers that are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss.</p>
