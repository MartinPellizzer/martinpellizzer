<p>Potentilla recta f. oxyodonta, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a hemicryptophyte with a mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, typical of the Rosaceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is appreciated in gardens for its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
