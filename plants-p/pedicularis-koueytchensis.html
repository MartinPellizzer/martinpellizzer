                    <h1>Pedicularis koueytchensis</h1>
<p>Pedicularis koueytchensis, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive spurred shape, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
