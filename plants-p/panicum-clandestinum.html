<p>Panicum clandestinum, commonly known as the secret panic grass, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and roadsides.
