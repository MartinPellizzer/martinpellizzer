<p>Polyspora hirtella, commonly known as the hairy polypore, is a species of bracket fungus belonging to the family Polyporaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, hairy surface and a woody, bracket-shaped fruiting body that typically grows on dead wood. The fungus is saprophytic, decomposing dead wood and playing a role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. It is found in temperate regions and is often associated with hardwood trees.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of fungal biodiversity in forest habitats.</p>
