<p>Psorophytum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Psorophytum is often used in traditional medicine and has potential applications in modern pharmacology due to its bioactive compounds.</p>
