                    <h1>Platanthera ophrydioides f. monophylla</h1>
<p>Platanthera ophrydioides f. monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf lady's tresses, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, elongated leaf that distinguishes it from other members of the species. The plant produces a dense spike of small, greenish-white flowers, which are often overlooked due to their muted coloration. It thrives in moist, calcareous habitats such as grasslands and woodlands, often in shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
