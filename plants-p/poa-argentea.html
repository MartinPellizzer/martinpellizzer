                    <h1>Poa argentea</h1>
<p>Poa argentea, commonly known as silver bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. This plant typically forms dense mats and is often found in meadows, dunes, and along the edges of wetlands. Poa argentea has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its soil-stabilizing properties.</p>
