                    <h1>Polypodium megalocarpum</h1>
<p>Polypodium megalocarpum, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome is robust and serves as a storage organ, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild.</p>
