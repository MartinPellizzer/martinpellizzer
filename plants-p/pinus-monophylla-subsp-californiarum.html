<p>Pinus monophylla subsp.</p>
<p>californiarum, commonly known as the California whitebark pine, is a subspecies native to the western United States. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its distinctive white bark and needle-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in high-elevation areas, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its cones are serotinous, meaning they remain closed until triggered by heat from a fire, allowing seeds to be released.</p>
<p>This adaptation aids in its regeneration in fire-prone ecosystems.</p>
