<p>Petrorhagia prolifera, commonly known as the creeping sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in coastal and arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Petrorhagia prolifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
