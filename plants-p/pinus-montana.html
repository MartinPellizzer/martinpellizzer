                    <h1>Pinus montana</h1>
<p>Pinus montana, commonly known as the Swiss stone pine, is a coniferous tree native to the Alps and other mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its straight, slender trunk and dense, needle-like foliage that grows in clusters of five. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife. Its cones and needles have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of resin.</p>
<p>Pinus montana is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or high-altitude environments.</p>
