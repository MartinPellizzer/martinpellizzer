                    <h1>Pyrus coronaria var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Pyrus coronaria var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits that ripen in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it distinct from the more common Pyrus coronaria, with its narrower leaves and specific habitat preferences.</p>
