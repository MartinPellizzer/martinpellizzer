<p>Pentheriella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, leafless appearance and its ability to thrive on tree branches without soil. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often difficult to spot in the dense forest canopy. Pentheriella is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment.</p>
