<p>Polypodium hirsutissimum var. sericeum, commonly known as the silky cliff fern, is a variant of the hairy polypody, characterized by its finely haired fronds.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. The fronds are typically lance-shaped with a serrated margin and a distinctive silvery sheen due to the dense covering of fine hairs. This variety is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, where it grows in humid, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
