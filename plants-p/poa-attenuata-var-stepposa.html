                    <h1>Poa attenuata var. stepposa</h1>
<p>Poa attenuata var. stepposa, commonly known as the steppe bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves that are often rolled in the bud. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
