<p>Phelypaea delilei, commonly known as the Delile's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feathery fronds that float on the water surface, aiding in light absorption for photosynthesis. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Phelypaea delilei plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
