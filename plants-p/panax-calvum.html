                    <h1>Panax calvum</h1>
<p>Panax calvum, commonly known as the smooth ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, unbranched root system and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Due to its medicinal properties and declining population, Panax calvum is highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial to preserve this species in its natural habitat.</p>
