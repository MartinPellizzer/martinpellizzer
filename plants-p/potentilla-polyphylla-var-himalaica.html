                    <h1>Potentilla polyphylla var. himalaica</h1>
<p>Potentilla polyphylla var. himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan potentilla, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate regions.</p>
