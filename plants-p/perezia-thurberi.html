                    <h1>Perezia thurberi</h1>
<p>Perezia thurberi, commonly known as the Thurber's perezia, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to the cloud forests of Mexico, it is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, enhancing its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Perezia thurberi is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes.</p>
