                    <h1>Pseudosmodingium andrieuxii</h1>
<p>Pseudosmodingium andrieuxii, commonly known as the African orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of East Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
