                    <h1>Popowia rufula</h1>
<p>Popowia rufula, commonly known as the roughleaf popowia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, rough hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, leathery fruits containing several seeds. Popowia rufula is adapted to dry environments and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of desert flora and a subject of study in ecological and botanical research.</p>
