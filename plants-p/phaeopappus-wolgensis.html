                    <h1>Phaeopappus wolgensis</h1>
<p>Phaeopappus wolgensis, commonly known as the dark pappus plant, is a rare flowering species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple to black bracts, which give it its common name, and its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phaeopappus wolgensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
