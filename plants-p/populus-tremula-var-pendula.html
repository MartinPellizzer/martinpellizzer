                    <h1>Populus tremula var. pendula</h1>
<p>Populus tremula var. pendula, commonly known as weeping willow, is a variant of the trembling aspen that is distinguished by its cascading, drooping branches.</p>
<p>This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a finely serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the autumn. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its ability to spread easily.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its graceful, weeping appearance.</p>
