                    <h1>Poa pratensis f. straminea</h1>
<p>Poa pratensis f. straminea, commonly known as the yellow meadow grass, is a botanical variant of the common sheep's fescue.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green foliage, which sets it apart from the typical green coloration of the standard Poa pratensis. This form is often found in grasslands and meadows, particularly in temperate regions. The plant is a perennial grass with tufted growth habit, producing inflorescences of spikelets.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass mixtures.</p>
