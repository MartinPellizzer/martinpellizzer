<p>Pneumatopteris longipes, commonly known as the long-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are pinnately divided with long, slender pinnae, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Pneumatopteris longipes plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
