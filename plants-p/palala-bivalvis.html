                    <h1>Palala bivalvis</h1>
<p>Palala bivalvis, commonly known as the spiral bivalve, is a unique marine mollusk characterized by its distinctive spiral shell.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pinnotheridae and is typically found in tropical and subtropical waters. The shell is often elongated and has a complex, coiled structure that provides protection. The plant-like appearance of its shell has led to its classification in the bivalve family, despite not being a true plant.</p>
<p>Its habitat and ecological role are still subjects of ongoing research in marine biology.</p>
