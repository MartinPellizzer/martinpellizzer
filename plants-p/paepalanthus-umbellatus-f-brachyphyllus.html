                    <h1>Paepalanthus umbellatus f. brachyphyllus</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus umbellatus f. brachyphyllus, commonly known as the short-leafed umbellate plant, is a compact, low-growing bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that form a central water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow to white flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens.</p>
