                    <h1>Podocarpus imbricatus var. kinabaluensis</h1>
<p>Podocarpus imbricatus var. kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Bornean podocarp, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and slender, cylindrical cones. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation to its mountainous habitat, with its needle-like leaves reducing water loss in cool, moist environments. It plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its native forests, providing habitat and contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
