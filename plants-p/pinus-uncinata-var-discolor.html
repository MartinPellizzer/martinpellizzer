                    <h1>Pinus uncinata var. discolor</h1>
<p>Pinus uncinata var. discolor, commonly known as the Discolored Scots Pine, is a variant of the Scots Pine native to the Pyrenees and southern France.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive bark that exhibits a mix of gray and reddish tones, and its needles are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical Scots Pine. The cones are small and often remain attached to the branches for a long time, contributing to its ornamental value. This variety thrives in mountainous regions with well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance makes it a notable species in botanical studies and horticulture.</p>
