<p>Paspalum multinervium, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Paspalum multinervium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
