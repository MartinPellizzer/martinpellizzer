<p>Polystichum ovatopaleaceum f. myokoense, commonly known as the Myoko shield fern, is a rare fern species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its ovate, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
