<p>Polypodium vulgare var. perpusillum, commonly known as the small maidenhair fern, is a delicate and compact fern species native to the forests of Europe.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, arching fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length, giving it a graceful, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
