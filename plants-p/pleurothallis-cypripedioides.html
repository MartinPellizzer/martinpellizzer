                    <h1>Pleurothallis cypripedioides</h1>
<p>Pleurothallis cypripedioides, commonly known as the yellow-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, with showy lips that are often a different color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture, though it remains relatively rare in the wild.</p>
