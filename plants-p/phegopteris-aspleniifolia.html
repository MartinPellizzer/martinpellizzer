                    <h1>Phegopteris aspleniifolia</h1>
<p>Phegopteris aspleniifolia, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a delicate fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lacy fronds that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
