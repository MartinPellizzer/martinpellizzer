                    <h1>Plutarchia dichogama</h1>
<p>Plutarchia dichogama, commonly known as the yellow nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has hairy stems and leaves with a serrated edge, typical of many nightshade species. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its dioecious nature, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants.</p>
