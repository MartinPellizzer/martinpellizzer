                    <h1>Pleurothallis dubia var. myriantha</h1>
<p>Pleurothallis dubia var. myriantha, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its striking, velvety flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant produces small, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Its inflorescence typically consists of several flowers arranged in a raceme, with showy, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
