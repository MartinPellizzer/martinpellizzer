<p>Paronychia appressa, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a powdery white coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates.</p>
