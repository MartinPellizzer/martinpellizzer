                    <h1>Prunus spinosa f. subepruinosa</h1>
<p>Prunus spinosa f. subepruinosa, commonly known as the sub-epruinose blackthorn, is a botanical variant of the common blackthorn.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced pruina, a waxy coating on the leaves, which gives it a distinct appearance compared to the typical form. The plant is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. Its leaves are typically smaller and more densely arranged, and it produces small, dark blue berries in the autumn.</p>
<p>This form is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphological features.</p>
