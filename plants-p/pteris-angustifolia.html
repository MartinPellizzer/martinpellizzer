                <h1>Pteris angustifolia</h1>
<p>Pteris angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Pteris angustifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant foliage and ability to thrive in indoor conditions.</p>
