<p>Polystichum ichangense, commonly known as the Ichang fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, lance-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments, often found in forests and mountainous regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in lines along the pinnae.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
