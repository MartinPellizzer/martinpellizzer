                    <h1>Parkinsonia praecox</h1>
<p>Parkinsonia praecox, commonly known as the early Parkinsonia, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen make it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>The bark is often fissured, and the wood is light and soft, used historically by indigenous peoples for various purposes.</p>
