                    <h1>Pyrenaria buisanensis</h1>
<p>Pyrenaria buisanensis, commonly known as the Bisan Island lichen, is a unique foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, crust-like thallus that forms a tight, leathery layer on its substrate. The plant exhibits a complex symbiotic relationship between its fungal and algal components, which contribute to its ability to absorb nutrients from the environment. It is typically found on the bark of old trees and rocky surfaces in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
