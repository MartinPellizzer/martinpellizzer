<p>Polypodium pallens, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern that thrives in rocky and shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is native to various regions across the Americas, including Mexico and parts of the United States. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns.</p>
<p>Polypodium pallens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy nature and ability to grow in poor soil conditions.</p>
