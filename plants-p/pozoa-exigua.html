                    <h1>Pozoa exigua</h1>
<p>Pozoa exigua, commonly known as the small pozoa, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the summer months. Pozoa exigua is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its short life cycle and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
