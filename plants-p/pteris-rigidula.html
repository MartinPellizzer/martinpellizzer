<p>Pteris rigidula, commonly known as the rigid water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Pteris rigidula is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in wet conditions makes it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems.</p>
