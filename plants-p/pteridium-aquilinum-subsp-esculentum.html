<p>Pteridium aquilinum subsp.</p>
<p>esculentum, commonly known as the edible fern or bracken, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and grasslands. The fiddleheads, or young curled fronds, are edible when harvested before they unfurl.</p>
