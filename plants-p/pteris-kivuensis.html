<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help it anchor in wet soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable.</p>
