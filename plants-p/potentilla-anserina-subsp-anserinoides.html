<p>Potentilla anserina subsp.</p>
<p>anserinoides, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh alpine environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
