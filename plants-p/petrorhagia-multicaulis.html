<p>Petrorhagia multicaulis, commonly known as the many-stemmed rock rose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features wiry, branched stems that often lie prostrate on the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Petrorhagia multicaulis is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
