                    <h1>Platystele beatricis</h1>
<p>Platystele beatricis, commonly known as the Beatrice's plume orchid, is a rare and critically endangered epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences bearing small, white to pale green flowers. The plant has a short, fleshy rhizome and produces tubular, leaf-like structures that serve as photosynthetic organs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive, making it highly sensitive to habitat disturbance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and threats from deforestation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
