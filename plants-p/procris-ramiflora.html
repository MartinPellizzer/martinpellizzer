<p>Procris ramiflora, commonly known as the branching-flowered orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, ramifying inflorescence that bears numerous small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers, which can be white, pink, or purple, are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects.</p>
