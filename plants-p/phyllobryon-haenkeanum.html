<p>Phyllobryon haenkeanum, commonly known as the golden moss, is a unique and rare plant species belonging to the family Pterobryaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, delicate foliage composed of small, overlapping leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are borne on short stalks and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Phyllobryon haenkeanum is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
