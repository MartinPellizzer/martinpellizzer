<p>Pterophylla madagascariensis var. madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar starfish plant, is a strikingly unique succulent native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often blue-green in color, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, adding a dramatic visual contrast to its foliage. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid native environment.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and ornamental appeal.</p>
