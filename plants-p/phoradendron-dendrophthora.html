                    <h1>Phoradendron dendrophthora</h1>
<p>Phoradendron dendrophthora, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Caribbean, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of trees such as mahogany and ceiba.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant's berries are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, often leading to weakened or dying trees over time.</p>
<p>The plant's presence is an indicator of forest health and biodiversity in tropical ecosystems.</p>
