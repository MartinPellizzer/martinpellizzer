<p>Planocarpa sulcata, commonly known as the zigzag acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are small, leathery, and often have a waxy coating to minimize transpiration.</p>
<p>Planocarpa sulcata is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
