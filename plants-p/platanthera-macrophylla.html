                    <h1>Platanthera macrophylla</h1>
<p>Platanthera macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf lady's-tresses, is a perennial orchid native to moist, shaded woodlands in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, spiraled inflorescence of fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often larger than those of most other orchids in its genus. It relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in many regions.</p>
