<p>Pedicularis rex subsp.</p>
<p>zayuensis, commonly known as the Yarlung Valley Beardtongue, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and Sichuan in China, where it thrives in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its vivid red and orange flowers, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for nutrients through its root system.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable and of conservation concern.</p>
