<p>Panicum lanuginosum var. siccanum, commonly known as the Sicilian foxtail, is a variant of the panic grass genus native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that resemble a foxtail. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its adaptability in arid environments.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is noted for its drought tolerance and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
