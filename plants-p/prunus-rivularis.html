                    <h1>Prunus rivularis</h1>
<p>Prunus rivularis, commonly known as the river almond, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, almond-like fruits that are edible but have a bitter taste. Prunus rivularis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones, where it plays a role in stabilizing riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native habitat.</p>
