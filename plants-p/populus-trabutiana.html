<p>Populus trabutiana, commonly known as the Trabut's poplar, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Salicaceae family, characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically features heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin and produces catkins as its primary reproductive structure. It is often found in riparian zones and forest edges, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
