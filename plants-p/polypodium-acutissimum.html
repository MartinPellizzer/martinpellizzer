<p>Polypodium acutissimum, commonly known as the acute-angled fern, is a species of polypody fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a finely divided, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in forested areas. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium acutissimum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.</p>
