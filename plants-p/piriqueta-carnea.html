                    <h1>Piriqueta carnea</h1>
<p>Piriqueta carnea, commonly known as the meat plant, is a unique carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, leaf-like structures that are capable of trapping and digesting small insects. The plant produces a striking red or pink flower that attracts pollinators while its modified leaves function as pitfall traps. Its botanical structure includes a central stem with adventitious roots and specialized glands for secreting digestive enzymes.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it thrives in nutrient-poor environments where it supplements its diet with captured prey.</p>
