<p>Poa compressa var. contracta, commonly known as the compact bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are typically shorter than those of other bluegrass species. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and ornamental purposes.</p>
