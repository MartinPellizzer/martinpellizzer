                    <h1>Potentilla arenaria subvar. grandiflora</h1>
<p>Potentilla arenaria subvar. grandiflora, commonly known as the sandstone cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and rocky habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are densely hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize soil in sandy or gravelly areas.</p>
<p>This subvariety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in preventing erosion in dry landscapes.</p>
