<p>Paraprasophyllum tunbridgense, commonly known as the Tunbridge Wells fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that arise from a short, creeping rhizome. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
