                    <h1>Potamogeton bunyonyiensis</h1>
<p>Potamogeton bunyonyiensis, commonly known as the Bunyonyi watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of East Africa, particularly Lake Bunyonyi in Uganda.</p>
<p>It has slender, branching stems that are typically less than 1 meter in length, with small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls. The plant produces tiny, floating flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, which are often visible near the water's surface. It plays an important role in aquatic habitats by providing shelter for fish and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
