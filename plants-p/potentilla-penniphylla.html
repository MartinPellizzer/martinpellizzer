                    <h1>Potentilla penniphylla</h1>
<p>Potentilla penniphylla, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to cold and arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is dense and fibrous, helping it survive in rocky and poorly drained soils.</p>
<p>Potentilla penniphylla is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and ornamental value in alpine gardens.</p>
