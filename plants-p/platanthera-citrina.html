                    <h1>Platanthera citrina</h1>
<p>Platanthera citrina, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist forested areas in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is notable for its lack of true leaves, as its photosynthetic structures are modified into narrow, blade-like leaves. It thrives in shaded, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other orchids in woodland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>
