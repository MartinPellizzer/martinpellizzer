<p>Polystichum pseudosetosum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
