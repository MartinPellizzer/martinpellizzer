                    <h1>Platydesma spathulatum f. kalalauense</h1>
<p>Platydesma spathulatum f. kalalauense, commonly known as the Kalalau flatleaf, is a rare variant of the flatleaf plant found primarily in specific coastal habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant exhibits a unique morphology adapted to withstand coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered flowers that are often pale green or white in color.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native environment.</p>
