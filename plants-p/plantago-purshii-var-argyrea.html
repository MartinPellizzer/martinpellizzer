                    <h1>Plantago purshii var. argyrea</h1>
<p>Plantago purshii var. argyrea, commonly known as silverleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves covered in fine, dense hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry meadows.</p>
<p>The leaves are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for their mild astringent properties.</p>
