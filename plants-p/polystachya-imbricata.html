<p>Polystachya imbricata, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a velvety appearance, and its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in rich, organic soil.</p>
