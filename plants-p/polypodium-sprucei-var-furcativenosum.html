                    <h1>Polypodium sprucei var. furcativenosum</h1>
<p>Polypodium sprucei var. furcativenosum, commonly known as the fork-veined holly fern, is a variant of the polypodium genus native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds with finely divided, serrated margins. The plant features a robust rhizome system that supports its growth in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in forest understories, where it thrives in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
