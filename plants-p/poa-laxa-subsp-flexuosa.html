<p>Poa laxa subsp.</p>
<p>flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats or cushions, often found in moist, well-drained soils such as those in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its flexible, arching growth habit, which allows it to withstand wind and grazing.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
