                    <h1>Poa serotina var. palustris</h1>
<p>Poa serotina var. palustris, commonly known as marsh bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 2 mm wide. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are clustered at the base of the stems, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to persist in waterlogged conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
