<p>Pachycarpus ligulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pachycarpus, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and stems, which are adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are often narrow and pointed, with a waxy surface that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Pachycarpus ligulatus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited to semi-desert conditions.</p>
