<p>Pilosella × rubra subsp.</p>
<p>chaunanthes, commonly known as the redhead or redflowered hawkweed, is a hybrid plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and bright yellow to orange composite flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides and in open woodlands. Its leaves are generally hairy, and the flowers are arranged in flat-topped clusters.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
