                    <h1>Pteris</h1>
<p>Pteris, commonly known as water ferns, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, feathery fronds and are often found in moist, shaded environments. Pteris species typically have a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes creeping along the soil surface. Their fronds are usually bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of pinnae, giving them a lacy appearance.</p>
<p>Many species of Pteris are popular in horticulture due to their ornamental value and ability to thrive in indoor conditions.</p>
