                    <h1>Polystichum gongboense</h1>
<p>Polystichum gongboense, commonly known as the Gongbo fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
