<p>Perlarius incanus, commonly known as the silver-haired fern, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that turn a silvery-white color as they mature. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Perlarius incanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in shaded environments with minimal maintenance.</p>
