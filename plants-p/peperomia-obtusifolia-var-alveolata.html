The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of greenish-white, which are typically hidden among the foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
