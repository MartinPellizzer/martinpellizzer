<p>Pabstiella lingua, commonly known as the tongue fern, is a unique tropical plant characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology.</p>
<p>Its fronds are elongated and often resemble the shape of a tongue, with a broad, flat structure that distinguishes it from other fern species. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats over time.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually green and glossy, with a waxy coating that aids in moisture retention.</p>
