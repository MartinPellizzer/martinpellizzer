                    <h1>Potentilla integrifolia</h1>
<p>Potentilla integrifolia, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine hairs, and its clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It has a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Potentilla integrifolia is also known for its edible roots, which have been used by indigenous peoples for food and traditional medicine.</p>
