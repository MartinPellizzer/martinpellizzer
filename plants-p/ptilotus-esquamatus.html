<p>Ptilotus esquamatus, commonly known as the sandhill plume, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery inflorescences that resemble plumes, which are composed of numerous small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with hairy stems and leaves, adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Ptilotus esquamatus is often found in sandy soils and is a common sight in coastal and inland dunes.</p>
