<p>Poa alpina subsp.</p>
<p>nodosa, commonly known as the nodular alpine grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to low-nutrient soils.</p>
<p>Its nodular root system helps it anchor in steep, unstable terrain and enhances its ability to fix nitrogen.</p>
