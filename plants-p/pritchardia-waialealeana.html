<p>Pritchardia waialealeana, commonly known as the Waialeale Mountain cycad, is a rare cycad species native to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several feet in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in the wet, humid climate of the rainforests on the island of Kauai.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts.</p>
