<p>Pollinia gryllus, commonly known as the cricket orchid, is a rare and intriguing orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated pollinia that resemble small, hardened masses, which are crucial for its pollination process. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and swamps, where it thrives in the understory. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive hood-like structure, and it blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Pollinia gryllus is considered a threatened species, making it a subject of conservation interest.</p>
