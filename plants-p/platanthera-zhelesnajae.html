                    <h1>Platanthera zhelesnajae</h1>
<p>Platanthera zhelesnajae, commonly known as the Zhelesnaja twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forested areas with rich, humus-filled soil. It is closely associated with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
