                    <h1>Paphiopedilum curtisii</h1>
<p>Paphiopedilum curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's orchid, is a rare and exquisite terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a unique, hairy pseudobulb and produces striking, fragrant flowers with a distinctive lip that is often a different color from the rest of the flower. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a rare beauty to botanical gardens and collections.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
