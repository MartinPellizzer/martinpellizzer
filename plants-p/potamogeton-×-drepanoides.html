<p>Potamogeton × drepanoides, commonly known as the hybrid water milfoil, is a perennial aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Potamogeton acutifolius and Potamogeton natans, exhibiting characteristics of both parents. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, green flowers that are typically clustered at the water's surface. It is commonly found in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and canals.</p>
