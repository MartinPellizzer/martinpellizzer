                    <h1>Puccinellia capillaris var. vaginata</h1>
<p>Puccinellia capillaris var. vaginata, commonly known as slender glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, enabling survival in arid conditions. The plant typically grows in salt marshes, sandy shores, and other coastal habitats where it tolerates high salinity. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
