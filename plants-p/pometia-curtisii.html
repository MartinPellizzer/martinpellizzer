                    <h1>Pometia curtisii</h1>
<p>Pometia curtisii, commonly known as the Philippine rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant typically grows in lowland to montane rainforests and has compound leaves with opposite arrangement. It produces small, white flowers that are followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing one or two seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and overharvesting, Pometia curtisii is considered a threatened species in its native habitat.</p>
