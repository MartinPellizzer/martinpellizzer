                    <h1>Paepalanthus bradei</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus bradei, commonly known as the Brade's pincushion cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of spines that protect it from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by cactus enthusiasts.</p>
