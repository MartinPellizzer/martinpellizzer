<p>Polypodium leuconeuron, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright yellow to golden in color, especially when young. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread along the forest floor or rock surfaces.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
