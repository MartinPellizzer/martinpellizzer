<p>Pedicularis tatarinowii, commonly known as the Tatarian lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
