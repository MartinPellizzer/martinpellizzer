                    <h1>Pearcea sprucei var. parviflora</h1>
<p>Pearcea sprucei var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf flowered pearcea, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, rounded berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover in colder climates.</p>
