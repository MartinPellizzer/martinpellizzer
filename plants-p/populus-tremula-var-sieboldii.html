                    <h1>Populus tremula var. sieboldii</h1>
<p>Populus tremula var. sieboldii, commonly known as the Japanese trembling aspen, is a variant of the trembling poplar native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its finely serrated, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse via the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate forested areas.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ornamental value and its role in ecological succession in its native habitats.</p>
