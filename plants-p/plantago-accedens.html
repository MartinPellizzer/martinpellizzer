                    <h1>Plantago accedens</h1>
<p>Plantago accedens, commonly known as sand plantain, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in elongated spikes. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system and waxy leaf surfaces.</p>
<p>The species is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
