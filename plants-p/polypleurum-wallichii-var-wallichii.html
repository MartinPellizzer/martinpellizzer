<p>Polypleurum wallichii var. wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater habitats such as streams and ponds, often growing in shallow, fast-flowing waters. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Its reproductive structures are borne on specialized fronds, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality.</p>
