<p>Pycreus globosus var. minimus, commonly known as the dwarf globular pycreus, is a compact, mat-forming succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish or purplish tinge. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
