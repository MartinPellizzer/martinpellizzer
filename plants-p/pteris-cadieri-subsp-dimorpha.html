<p>Pteris cadieri subsp.</p>
<p>dimorpha, commonly known as the two-form maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds that are dimorphic, meaning the upper and lower pinnae differ in shape and size.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bright green and have a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
