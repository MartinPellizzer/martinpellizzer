                    <h1>Pinus sylvestris f. serpentina</h1>
<p>Pinus sylvestris f. serpentina, commonly known as the serpentino pine, is a unique form of the Scots pine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, twisted, and spiraling growth pattern, which gives it a striking, almost otherworldly appearance. This form is a natural mutation that occurs in certain populations of the species, often in harsh environments. The foliage is dense and dark green, with needles that are slightly longer than those of the typical Scots pine.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in northern Europe and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture.</p>
