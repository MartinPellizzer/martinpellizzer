<p>Polystichum sinkiangense, commonly known as the Xinjiang wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the arid regions of Xinjiang, China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in mountainous and semi-arid environments. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Polystichum sinkiangense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
