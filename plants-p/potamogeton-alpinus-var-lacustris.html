                    <h1>Potamogeton alpinus var. lacustris</h1>
<p>Potamogeton alpinus var. lacustris, commonly known as the alpine pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to cold, freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense underwater vegetation. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by water currents.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to low-nutrient, oligotrophic waters and plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
