<p>Posoqueria spraguei, commonly known as the Florida ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale green, leaf-like structures and a single, showy white flower. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in the Florida panhandle. It has specialized roots that absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
