                    <h1>Psydrax graniticola</h1>
<p>Psydrax graniticola, commonly known as the granite rock fig, is a rare and unique plant native to the rocky environments of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Moraceae family. Its fruit is a small, round fig-like structure that is edible and often consumed by local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from human activity, Psydrax graniticola is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
