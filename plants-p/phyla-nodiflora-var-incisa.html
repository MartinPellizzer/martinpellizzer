<p>Phyla nodiflora var. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pearlwort, is a succulent plant belonging to the family Aizoaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It is native to regions of southern Africa and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
