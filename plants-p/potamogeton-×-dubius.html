                    <h1>Potamogeton × dubius</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × dubius, commonly known as the hybrid water milfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Potamogeton crispus and Potamogeton praelatus.</p>
<p>It typically grows in freshwater environments such as lakes, rivers, and ponds, often forming dense vegetation mats. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often ribbon-like in appearance, and it produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Potamogeton × dubius is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to dense underwater coverage, impacting water quality and aquatic biodiversity.</p>
<p>It plays a role in providing habitat for various aquatic organisms but can also be considered a nuisance in some ecosystems.</p>
