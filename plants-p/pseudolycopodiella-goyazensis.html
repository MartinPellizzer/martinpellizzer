                <h1>Pseudolycopodiella goyazensis</h1>
<p>Pseudolycopodiella goyazensis, commonly known as the Goyazensis clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact stature and dense, needle-like leaves that form a rosette structure. Native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. It produces small, spore-bearing cones rather than flowers, making it a primitive vascular plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
