<p>Plagioscyphus jumellei, commonly known as the Jumelle's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its carnivorous nutrition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowers are small and usually pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>Plagioscyphus jumellei is native to parts of Africa and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
