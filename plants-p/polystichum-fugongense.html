                    <h1>Polystichum fugongense</h1>
<p>Polystichum fugongense, commonly known as the Fugong fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
