<p>Polystichum riparium, commonly known as the river fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows along riverbanks and moist soils, thriving in shaded, humid environments. Its spores are released from clusters of sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polystichum riparium plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
