<p>Persica vulgaris f. versicolor, commonly known as the variegated peach.</p>
<p>This is a horticultural variant of the peach tree, characterized by its striking variegated foliage that features a mix of green, white, and sometimes pink or red hues. The leaves are typically broader and more ornamental than those of the standard peach, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. While it produces small, less flavorful fruit compared to typical peaches, its visual appeal is its main attraction.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring regular pruning to maintain its shape and promote healthy growth.</p>
