                    <h1>Physokentia thurstonii</h1>
<p>Physokentia thurstonii, commonly known as the Thurston's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of Tonga in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure its survival in the wild.</p>
