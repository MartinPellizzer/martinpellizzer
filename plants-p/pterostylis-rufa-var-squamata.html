                    <h1>Pterostylis rufa var. squamata</h1>
<p>Pterostylis rufa var. squamata, commonly known as the red-stemmed helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a slender, often reddish stem and produces small, greenish or brownish flowers clustered at the base. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine, scaly texture, giving it its specific epithet "squamata.".</p>
<p>The orchid relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common feature among orchid species.</p>
