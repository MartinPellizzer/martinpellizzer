                    <h1>Potentilla cryptophila</h1>
<p>Potentilla cryptophila, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with its compact growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Potentilla cryptophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens.</p>
