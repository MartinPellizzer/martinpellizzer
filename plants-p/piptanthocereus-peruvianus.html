<p>Piptanthocereus peruvianus, commonly known as the Peruvian apple cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly spines, which help to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its fruit, known as the "Peruvian apple," is edible and has a sweet, apple-like flavor.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to high-altitude, rocky habitats and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
