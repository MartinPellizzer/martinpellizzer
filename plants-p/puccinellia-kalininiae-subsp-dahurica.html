<p>Puccinellia kalininiae subsp.</p>
<p>dahurica, commonly known as the Dahurian saltbush, is a perennial grass species native to the cold and arid regions of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of steppe and semi-desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
