<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely toothed, silver-gray leaves that reflect light and help it survive in high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
