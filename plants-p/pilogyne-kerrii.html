                    <h1>Pilogyne kerrii</h1>
<p>Pilogyne kerrii, commonly known as the Kew's pilogyne, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical rainforests of West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle beauty to its foliage. Pilogyne kerrii is primarily found in shaded, humid environments, where it thrives in the undergrowth of dense forest canopies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
