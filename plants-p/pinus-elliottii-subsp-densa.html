<p>Pinus elliottii subsp.</p>
<p>densa, commonly known as the pond pine, is a subspecies of the slash pine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and relatively small, cone-like structures.</p>
<p>The tree typically grows in wetland habitats, including swamps and floodplains, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its cones are small and often remain closed for years before opening to release seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
