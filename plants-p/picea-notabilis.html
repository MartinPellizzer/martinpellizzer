                    <h1>Picea notabilis</h1>
<p>Picea notabilis, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a coniferous tree native to western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, scaly bark that becomes thick and furrowed with age. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in mountainous regions with poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and vulnerability to pests like the mountain pine beetle, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
