<p>Poa elatior var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly broader than the typical variety. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in shaded woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
