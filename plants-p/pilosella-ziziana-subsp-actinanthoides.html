<p>Pilosella ziziana subsp.</p>
<p>actinanthoides, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb with a low-growing habit, characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth pattern.</p>
<p>The plant features basal leaves that are typically woolly or hairy, and it produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
