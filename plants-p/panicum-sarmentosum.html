<p>Panicum sarmentosum, commonly known as silverleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering its leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
