                    <h1>Pyrola rotundifolia f. nephrophylla</h1>
<p>Pyrola rotundifolia f. nephrophylla, commonly known as the kidney-leafed wintergreen, is a rare, low-growing herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or reddish in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes, often growing in association with other shade-tolerant species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
