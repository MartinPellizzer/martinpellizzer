                            <h1>Potentilla Compacta</h1>
<p>Potentilla compacta is a low-growing, evergreen shrub known for its dense foliage and vibrant yellow flowers. Native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. This plant is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its compact form and hardy nature. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to the landscape. Despite its small size, Potentilla compacta is a resilient and ornamental addition to any garden.</p>
