<p>Polypodium sertularioides, commonly known as the rock holly, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often clustered together. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizome is short and thick, anchoring it to the substrate.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
