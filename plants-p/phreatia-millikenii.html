                    <h1>Phreatia millikenii</h1>
<p>Phreatia millikenii, commonly known as the milliken's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, pale pink to white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its unique morphology includes long, slender pseudobulbs and narrow, leathery leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and its elusive nature, Phreatia millikenii is considered critically endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
