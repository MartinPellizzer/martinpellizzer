                    <h1>Pleurogyne rotata</h1>
<p>Pleurogyne rotata, commonly known as the spiral waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves, which spiral around its stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged in water, aiding in its photosynthetic process. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Its morphology is adapted for efficient water absorption and light capture in aquatic habitats.</p>
