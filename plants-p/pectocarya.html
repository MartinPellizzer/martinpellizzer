                    <h1>Pectocarya</h1>
<p>Pectocarya, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid regions of southern Africa, where they thrive in rocky and sandy soils. Pectocarya species are characterized by their fleshy, often hairy leaves and showy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening. They are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through various mechanisms, including succulence and nocturnal blooming.</p>
<p>Due to their unique appearance and ecological adaptations, Pectocarya plants are of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
