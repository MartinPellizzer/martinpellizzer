                    <h1>Phenax urticifolius</h1>
<p>Phenax urticifolius, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its rough, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically serrated and covered in fine, stinging hairs that release irritants when touched. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>Its fibrous stems have been historically used for making textiles and as a source of nourishment.</p>
