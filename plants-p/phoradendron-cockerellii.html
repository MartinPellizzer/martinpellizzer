                    <h1>Phoradendron cockerellii</h1>
<p>Phoradendron cockerellii, commonly known as the Florida mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while conducting photosynthesis to produce its own food. The plant produces small, white, egg-shaped berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The Florida mistletoe plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and other wildlife.</p>
