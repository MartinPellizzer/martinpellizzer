                    <h1>Pleopeltis zeylanica</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often grow in compact, rosette-like formations. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Pleopeltis zeylanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
