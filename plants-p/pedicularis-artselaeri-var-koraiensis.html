<p>Pedicularis artselaeri var. koraiensis, commonly known as the Korean monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Korea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its specialized roots. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments and blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
