<p>Polypodium microsorum, commonly known as the small-leaf wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing rosette of lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are usually evergreen, with a distinctive, compact structure that helps it conserve moisture.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
