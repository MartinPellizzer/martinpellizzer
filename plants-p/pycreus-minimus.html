<p>Pycreus minimus, commonly known as the small pycreus, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many ornamental and economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, clustered in small inflorescences, and are adapted for pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pycreus minimus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
