<p>Parodia werneri subsp.</p>
<p>pleiocephala, commonly known as the "Cushion Cactus," is a compact, globular cactus native to southern Africa. It features a dense, rounded stem covered in short, white spines, giving it a fluffy appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in summer. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
