                    <h1>Pinus edulis var. monophylla</h1>
<p>Pinus edulis var. monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf pinyon, is a variant of the pinyon pine native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive single leaflets on each branch, which set it apart from other pinyon species. The plant produces edible seeds, known as pinyon nuts, which are a valuable food source for both wildlife and humans. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and at high elevations.</p>
<p>The tree is also an important component of local ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability.</p>
