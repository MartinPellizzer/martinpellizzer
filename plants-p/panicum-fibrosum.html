                    <h1>Panicum fibrosum</h1>
<p>Panicum fibrosum, commonly known as fibrous panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often fibrous in texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, Panicum fibrosum is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage crop.</p>
