<p>Polypodium tenuisectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant features a rhizome that produces both roots and fronds, with the fronds being pinnately compound and often divided into narrow segments. Its leaves are usually evergreen, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in humid environments.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, releasing spores for propagation.</p>
