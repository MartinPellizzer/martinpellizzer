<p>Pinus pyrenaica subsp.</p>
<p>mauretanica, commonly known as the Mauretanian pine, is a subspecies native to North Africa, particularly Morocco and the western Sahara. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer with needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more clustered than those of other pine species.</p>
<p>The cones of this subspecies are generally smaller and more slender, with scales that open to release the seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions and high temperatures.</p>
<p>The tree plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat in its native ecosystems.</p>
