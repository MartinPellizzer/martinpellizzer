                    <h1>Panax sokpayensis</h1>
<p>Panax sokpayensis, commonly known as the Sokpay ginseng, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Thailand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy roots that resemble those of other ginseng species. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments at high altitudes, where it thrives in rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red berries.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Panax sokpayensis is considered a valuable but endangered botanical resource.</p>
