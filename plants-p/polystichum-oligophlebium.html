<p>Polystichum oligophlebium, commonly known as the narrow-veined wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with upright, branched fronds that can reach up to 60 cm in length. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
