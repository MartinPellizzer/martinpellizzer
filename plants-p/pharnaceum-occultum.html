                    <h1>Pharnaceum occultum</h1>
<p>Pharnaceum occultum, commonly known as the shadow orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the dense, misty forests of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and a unique, elongated spur that stores nectar for specialized pollinators. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often growing on the forest floor or on rocky outcrops. Its flowers bloom only during the late evening, releasing a subtle fragrance that attracts nocturnal insects.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Pharnaceum occultum is considered endangered and is the subject of ongoing botanical research.</p>
