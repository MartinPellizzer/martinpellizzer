<p>Physurus callodictyus, commonly known as the roughleaf water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, rough-textured leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close during the heat of the day. Its roots anchor it in muddy substrates, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Physurus callodictyus plays an important role in water filtration and serves as a food source for waterfowl and other aquatic life.</p>
