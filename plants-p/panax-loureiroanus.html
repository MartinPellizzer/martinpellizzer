<p>Panax loureiroanus, commonly known as the Chinese ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy roots, which are the primary part used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring compound leaves with serrated edges and small, greenish-white flowers. Its roots contain various bioactive compounds, including ginsenosides, which are believed to have adaptogenic and medicinal properties.</p>
