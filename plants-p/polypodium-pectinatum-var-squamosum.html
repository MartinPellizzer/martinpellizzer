<p>Polypodium pectinatum var. squamosum, commonly known as the scaly holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, scaly fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year.</p>
<p>The spores are released from sori located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
