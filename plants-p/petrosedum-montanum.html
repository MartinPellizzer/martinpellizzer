<p>Petrosedum montanum, commonly known as the mountain stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems covered in small, green, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Petrosedum montanum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
