                    <h1>Physaria arenosa var. argillosa</h1>
<p>Physaria arenosa var. argillosa, commonly known as the clay-plain bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, lobed leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in elongated racemes. Its seeds are enclosed in small, bladder-like pods, a feature that distinguishes it from many other plant species.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or clay soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
