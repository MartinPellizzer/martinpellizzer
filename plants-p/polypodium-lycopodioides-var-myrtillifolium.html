<p>Polypodium lycopodioides var. myrtillifolium, commonly known as the blue mist fern, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically bluish-green in color, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizome producing both sterile and fertile fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
