<p>Phreatia elongata, commonly known as the elongated phreatia, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in lowland tropical forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil and air, making it well-suited for epiphytic growth.</p>
<p>The flowers of Phreatia elongata are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that aids in pollination.</p>
