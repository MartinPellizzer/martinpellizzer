                    <h1>Psamma littoralis</h1>
<p>Psamma littoralis, commonly known as the coastal sandflat grass, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in saline and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, a common trait in coastal flora. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Psamma littoralis plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
