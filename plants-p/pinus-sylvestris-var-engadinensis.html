                    <h1>Pinus sylvestris var. engadinensis</h1>
<p>Pinus sylvestris var. engadinensis, commonly known as the Engadine Scots pine, is a subspecies of the Scots pine native to the Alps.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are shorter and more densely arranged than those of the typical Scots pine. The cones are typically smaller and more compact, and the tree exhibits a distinct, often stunted growth form due to its high-altitude habitat. This variety is well adapted to cold, harsh environments and is often found in mountainous regions with poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
