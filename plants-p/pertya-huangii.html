<p>Pertya huangii, commonly known as the Huang's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a unique morphology, featuring a slender, unbranched stem and a single, showy inflorescence. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to the humid, shaded environments where it grows.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Pertya huangii is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas.</p>
