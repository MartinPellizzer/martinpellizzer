<p>Polystichum lhasaense, commonly known as the Lhasa brake fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal, India, and Tibet.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous forests at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polystichum lhasaense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
