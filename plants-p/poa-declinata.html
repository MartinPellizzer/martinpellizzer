                    <h1>Poa declinata</h1>
<p>Poa declinata, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and slender, often curved inflorescences. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its ability to tolerate shade makes it a common component of turfgrass mixtures.</p>
<p>Poa declinata plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
