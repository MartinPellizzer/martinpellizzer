                    <h1>Paronychia baldwinii var. ciliata</h1>
<p>Paronychia baldwinii var. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy paronychia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
