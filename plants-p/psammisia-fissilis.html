<p>Psammisia fissilis, commonly known as the sandstone lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique growth form, which allows it to adhere to and colonize mineral surfaces such as sandstone. The organism is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Its structure consists of a crust-like thallus that is tightly attached to the substrate.</p>
<p>Psammisia fissilis plays a vital ecological role in stabilizing soil and contributing to nutrient cycling in harsh desert ecosystems.</p>
