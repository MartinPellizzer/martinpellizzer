                    <h1>Pneumatopteris pergamacea</h1>
<p>Pneumatopteris pergamacea, commonly known as the parchment fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, large, and leathery fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plant's fronds are typically bipinnate, with a smooth, almost parchment-like texture that gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
