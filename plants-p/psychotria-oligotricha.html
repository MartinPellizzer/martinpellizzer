                    <h1>Psychotria oligotricha</h1>
<p>Psychotria oligotricha, commonly known as the "Coca plant" or "Yareta," is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in high-altitude, cold environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and have been historically associated with the production of cocaine.</p>
<p>However, due to its ecological importance and conservation status, it is now protected in many regions.</p>
