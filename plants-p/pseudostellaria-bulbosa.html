                    <h1>Pseudostellaria bulbosa</h1>
<p>Pseudostellaria bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its root system consists of a bulb-like structure that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Pseudostellaria bulbosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
