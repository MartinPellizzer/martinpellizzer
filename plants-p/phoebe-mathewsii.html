<p>Phoebe mathewsii, commonly known as the Matthews' phoebe, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phoebe mathewsii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
