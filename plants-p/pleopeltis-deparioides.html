<p>Pleopeltis deparioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and its ability to thrive on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a dark green, leathery texture with a slightly serrated margin. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, round structures called sori.</p>
<p>This plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
