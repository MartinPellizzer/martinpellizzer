<p>Pleurothallis renipetala, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that are often pale green or white, with a velvety texture. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its leaves are usually dark green and somewhat fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environment.</p>
<p>The genus Pleurothallis is one of the largest in the orchid family, with over 1,500 species, many of which are rare and difficult to cultivate.</p>
