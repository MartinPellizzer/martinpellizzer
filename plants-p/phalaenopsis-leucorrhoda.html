                <h1>Phalaenopsis leucorrhoda</h1>
<p>Phalaenopsis leucorrhoda, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling ghostly shapes, hence its common name. It has long, slender leaves and a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchid species.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a conservation concern.</p>
