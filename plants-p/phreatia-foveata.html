                    <h1>Phreatia foveata</h1>
<p>Phreatia foveata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its pale green, leafless stems and its striking, white, fragrant flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and specific soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
