<p>Pothos sanderianus, commonly known as the Sander's ivy, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly variegated pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is primarily grown for its foliage rather than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and is known for its adaptability to various indoor conditions.</p>
<p>Pothos sanderianus is a popular choice for hanging baskets and vertical gardens due to its trailing growth habit.</p>
