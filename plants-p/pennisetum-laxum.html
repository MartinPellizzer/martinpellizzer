                    <h1>Pennisetum laxum</h1>
<p>Pennisetum laxum, commonly known as soft beardgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and fluffy, silver-tan seed heads that give it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Pennisetum laxum is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate, ornate foliage and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
