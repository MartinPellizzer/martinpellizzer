                    <h1>Prosopis juliflora var. glandulosa</h1>
<p>Prosopis juliflora var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and small, bean-like pods that contain toxic seeds. The plant produces yellow, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
