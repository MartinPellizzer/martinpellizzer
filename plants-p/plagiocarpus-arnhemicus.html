<p>Plagiocarpus arnhemicus, commonly known as the desert shield-leaf, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Plagiocarpus arnhemicus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
