                    <h1>Pseudophegopteris zayuensis</h1>
<p>Pseudophegopteris zayuensis, commonly known as the Yarlung Tsangpo fern, is a rare and unique species of fern found in the high-altitude regions of southern Tibet and northern India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a complex, bipinnate structure. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically in mountainous areas with rich, shaded soil. Its spores are dispersed through wind, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
