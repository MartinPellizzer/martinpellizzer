                    <h1>Polystichum glaciale</h1>
<p>Polystichum glaciale, commonly known as the glacier fern, is a hardy evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features dark green, leathery, and lance-shaped fronds that are tightly curled when young and unfurl as they mature. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>The fronds are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps to reflect excess light and reduce water loss.</p>
