<p>Potentilla pedemontana, commonly known as the Alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit with numerous small, bright yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Potentilla pedemontana plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal.</p>
