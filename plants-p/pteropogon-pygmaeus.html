                    <h1>Pteropogon pygmaeus</h1>
<p>Pteropogon pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf flying frog, is a small amphibian native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive webbed toes and translucent skin, which aid in its arboreal lifestyle. The species is adapted for gliding between trees, using its extended fingers and toes to create a parachute-like structure. It primarily feeds on insects and small invertebrates found in its moist, forested habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Pteropogon pygmaeus is considered vulnerable to conservation threats.</p>
