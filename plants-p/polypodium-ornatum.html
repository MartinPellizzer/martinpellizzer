<p>Polypodium ornatum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for reproduction through spores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Polypodium ornatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions.</p>
