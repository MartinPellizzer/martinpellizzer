<p>Pescatoria dayana, commonly known as the silverleaf cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, waxy hair that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which are a typical adaptation to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Pescatoria dayana is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
