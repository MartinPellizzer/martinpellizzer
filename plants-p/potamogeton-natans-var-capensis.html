                    <h1>Potamogeton natans var. capensis</h1>
<p>Potamogeton natans var. capensis, commonly known as Cape watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It has slender, branching stems that are often flexible and can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, aiding in its ability to photosynthesize underwater. It typically blooms with tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are often submerged or just at the water's surface.</p>
<p>This species is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as lakes and ponds.</p>
