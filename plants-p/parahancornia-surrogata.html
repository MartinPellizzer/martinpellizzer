                    <h1>Parahancornia surrogata</h1>
<p>Parahancornia surrogata, commonly known as the desert holly, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features succulent, spiny stems and small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems makes it well-adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>The species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
