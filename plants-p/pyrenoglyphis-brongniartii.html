<p>It is characterized by its floating fronds that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to spread and colonize new areas. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with small, spore-producing sporangia located on the underside.</p>
<p>Pyrenoglyphis brongniartii plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
