                    <h1>Picea excelsa f. bicornis</h1>
<p>Picea excelsa f. bicornis, commonly known as the giant white spruce, is a rare variant of the white spruce tree native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its exceptionally tall stature, often reaching heights of over 50 meters, and its distinctive, often bifurcated crown. The leaves are needle-like, typically blue-green in color, and arranged in a dense, conical pattern. Its bark is thin and smooth, with a grayish-white appearance, and it produces small, cone-like fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance.</p>
