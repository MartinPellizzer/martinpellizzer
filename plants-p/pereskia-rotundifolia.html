                    <h1>Pereskia rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Pereskia rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaved cactus, is a unique species belonging to the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often mistaken for leaves, which are actually modified stems for water storage. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are rounded and typically fall off as the plant matures, giving it a more shrub-like appearance.</p>
<p>Pereskia rotundifolia is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
