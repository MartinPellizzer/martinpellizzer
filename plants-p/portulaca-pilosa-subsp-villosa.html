<p>Portulaca pilosa subsp.</p>
<p>villosa, commonly known as hairy portulaca, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant.</p>
