                <h1>Platanthera tenuior</h1>
<p>Platanthera tenuior, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and a dense, fragrant spike of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and wet meadows, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant is pollinated by various species of bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Platanthera tenuior is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
