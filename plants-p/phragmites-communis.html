<p>Phragmites communis, commonly known as common reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, jointed stems and dense, feather-like plumes that appear in the fall. The plant is highly adaptable and can grow in a variety of water conditions, including brackish and freshwater habitats. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks, allowing it to spread rapidly and dominate wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Common reed plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
