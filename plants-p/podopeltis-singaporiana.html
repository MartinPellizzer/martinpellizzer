                <h1>Podopeltis singaporiana</h1>
<p>Podopeltis singaporiana, commonly known as the Singapore rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with slender, creeping stems that produce small, lance-shaped fronds. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
