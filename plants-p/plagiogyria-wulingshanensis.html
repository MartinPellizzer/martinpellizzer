<p>Plagiogyria wulingshanensis, commonly known as the Wuling Mountains plagiogyria, is a rare and endemic moss species native to the Wuling Mountains in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its small, acrocarpous growth form. The plant exhibits a dense, cushion-like structure with tightly appressed leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecosystem health.</p>
