                    <h1>Phoradendron rubrum var. gracile</h1>
<p>Phoradendron rubrum var. gracile, commonly known as the graceful mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. The plant's flowers are typically greenish-white and lack petals, which is a characteristic of many mistletoe species. It spreads primarily through bird-dispersed seeds, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its hemiparasitic nature, relying on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis.</p>
