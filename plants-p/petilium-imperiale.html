                    <h1>Petilium imperiale</h1>
<p>Petilium imperiale, commonly known as the royal spire plant, is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family, native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 3 meters in height, crowned with clusters of vibrant blue to purple tubular flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its unique floral structure attracts specific pollinators, such as certain species of bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
