                    <h1>Pyrrhocactus grandiflorus</h1>
<p>Pyrrhocactus grandiflorus, commonly known as the grandiflorous pyrrhocactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a typical adaptation for minimizing water loss.</p>
<p>Pyrrhocactus grandiflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xerophytic gardens.</p>
