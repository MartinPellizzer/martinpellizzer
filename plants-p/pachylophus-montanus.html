<p>Pachylophus montanus, commonly known as the mountain thickleaf, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white or pale yellow.</p>
<p>Pachylophus montanus is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in low-nutrient environments.</p>
