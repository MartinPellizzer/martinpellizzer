<p>Pilosella euchaetia subsp.</p>
<p>padloschinensis, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid, high-altitude habitat. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant within its native range.</p>
