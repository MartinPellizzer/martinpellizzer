                    <h1>Pinus sylvestris var. sarmatica</h1>
<p>Pinus sylvestris var. sarmatica, commonly known as the Sarmatian Scots pine, is a variant of the Scots pine native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid than those of the typical Scots pine. The cones are conical and often remain attached to the branches for a long time, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with cold winters.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ecological importance and is often planted in landscaping for its aesthetic and environmental benefits.</p>
