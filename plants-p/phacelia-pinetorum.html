                    <h1>Phacelia pinetorum</h1>
<p>Phacelia pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate blue to purple flowers and hairy stems, which help it thrive in sunny, well-drained soils. This species is often found in open coniferous forests and woodland edges, where it forms dense, herbaceous mats. Its root system is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to persist in harsh mountain environments.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
