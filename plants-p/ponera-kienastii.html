<p>Ponera kienastii, commonly known as the Kienast's ponytail fern, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, cascading fronds that resemble a ponytail. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread along the forest floor, often forming dense mats. Its fronds are typically dark green and leathery, with a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ponera kienastii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
