                    <h1>Polypodium consociatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium consociatum, commonly known as the clustered polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, a feature typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
