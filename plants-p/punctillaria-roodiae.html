                    <h1>Punctillaria roodiae</h1>
<p>Punctillaria roodiae, commonly known as the desert starflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which includes many succulent species adapted to dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in response to rainfall, often in late summer or early autumn. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Punctillaria roodiae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
