                    <h1>Polypodium vittariifolium</h1>
<p>Polypodium vittariifolium, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, linear to lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green and covered in minute, scale-like structures. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Polypodium vittariifolium is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions.</p>
