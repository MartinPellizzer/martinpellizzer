                            <h1>Phalangium Coarctatum</h1>
<p>Phalangium coarctatum is a unique and lesser-known species of millipede found in specific regions of southern Africa. This small, elongated arthropod is notable for its distinctive coloration and delicate body structure. Despite its modest size, it plays an important role in its ecosystem as a decomposer and prey species. Its habitat is often limited to moist, shaded environments, which makes it vulnerable to environmental changes. Understanding this species contributes to broader knowledge of biodiversity and conservation in its native range.</p>
