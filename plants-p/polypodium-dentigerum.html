<p>Polypodium dentigerum, commonly known as the toothed holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rhizomatous growth habit with dense, glossy, dark green fronds that have a serrated or toothed margin. The fronds are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller, feather-like segments, giving the plant a lush, fern-like appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
