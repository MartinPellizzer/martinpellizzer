                    <h1>Polypodium cryptum</h1>
<p>Polypodium cryptum, commonly known as the hidden fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds.</p>
<p>It is a cryptophytic plant, meaning it grows in shaded, often moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that helps it spread and establish new colonies. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Polypodium cryptum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of shaded, humid ecosystems.</p>
