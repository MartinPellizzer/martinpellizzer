<p>Prosopis scandens, commonly known as the honey mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to long, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Prosopis scandens is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded landscapes.</p>
