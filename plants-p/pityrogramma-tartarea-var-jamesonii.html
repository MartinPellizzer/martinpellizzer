                    <h1>Pityrogramma tartarea var. jamesonii</h1>
<p>Pityrogramma tartarea var. jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped fronds with a distinctive shield-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>The varietal form, jamesonii, is distinguished by subtle differences in frond morphology and habitat preference compared to the typical species.</p>
