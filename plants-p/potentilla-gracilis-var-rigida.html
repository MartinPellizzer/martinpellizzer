<p>Potentilla gracilis var. rigida, commonly known as rigid potentilla, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often used in alpine gardens and rockeries.</p>
