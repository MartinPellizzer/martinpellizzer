                    <h1>Polypodium cordemoyi</h1>
<p>Polypodium cordemoyi, commonly known as the cordemoy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often clustered together. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain rather than from soil. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and survive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, elongated shape that gives the plant its common name.</p>
