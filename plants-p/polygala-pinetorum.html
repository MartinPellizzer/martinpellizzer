<p>Polygala pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest milk-vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in dry, sandy soils within pine woodlands. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Polygala pinetorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations.</p>
