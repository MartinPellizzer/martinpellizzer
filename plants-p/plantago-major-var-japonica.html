                    <h1>Plantago major var. japonica</h1>
<p>Plantago major var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese plantain, is a perennial herb native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface and a prominent central vein. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, gardens, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to the common plantain but exhibits distinct morphological characteristics adapted to its native environment.</p>
