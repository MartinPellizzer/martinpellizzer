                    <h1>Poecilopteris repanda</h1>
<p>Poecilopteris repanda, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the fern family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, and often lobed fronds that were typical of Late Paleozoic flora. This plant thrived in swampy and wetland environments, contributing to the formation of coal deposits. Its structure suggests it had a complex vascular system, allowing it to grow tall and support its massive fronds.</p>
<p>Poecilopteris repanda is an important index fossil for dating geological strata from the Carboniferous period.</p>
