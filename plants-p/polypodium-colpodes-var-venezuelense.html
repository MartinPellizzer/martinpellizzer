<p>Polypodium colpodes var. venezuelense, commonly known as the Venezuelan shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus Polypodium.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant is native to the tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Venezuela. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in moist, shaded habitats.</p>
