<p>Primula pulverulenta, commonly known as the dust primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with clustered stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces numerous stamen and pistil structures, typical of the Primulaceae family, and has hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and rockeries worldwide.</p>
