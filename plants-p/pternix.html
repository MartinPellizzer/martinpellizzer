                    <h1>Pternix</h1>
<p>Pternix, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered clusters on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns.</p>
