<p>Prescottia, commonly known as the "gardenia of the Andes," is a genus of flowering plants native to South America.</p>
<p>It consists of only two species, Prescottia nitida and Prescottia pachyclada, both of which are evergreen shrubs. The plants are characterized by their large, fragrant white or yellow flowers, which bloom in late winter or early spring. They have leathery, dark green leaves and are often cultivated for their ornamental value.</p>
