                    <h1>Poa anceps var. minima</h1>
<p>Poa anceps var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf mountain bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact inflorescences. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its small stature and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range.</p>
