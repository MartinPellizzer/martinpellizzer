                    <h1>Prosopis yaquiana</h1>
<p>Prosopis yaquiana, commonly known as the Yaqui mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically reduced to spines in mature plants, and its yellowish-green pods that contain edible seeds. The plant is well adapted to drought and poor soils, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
<p>Its wood is sometimes used locally for construction and fuel.</p>
