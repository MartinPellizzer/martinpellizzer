<p>Primula hirsuta var. exscapa, commonly known as the hairy primrose or the scapose primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system allows it to anchor firmly in rocky soils, making it well adapted to its high-altitude environment.</p>
