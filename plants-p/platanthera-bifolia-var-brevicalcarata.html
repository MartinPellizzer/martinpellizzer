                    <h1>Platanthera bifolia var. brevicalcarata</h1>
<p>Platanthera bifolia var. brevicalcarata, commonly known as the short-spurred lady's-sock, is a rare orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers with short, rounded spurs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, this variety is considered threatened in many regions.</p>
