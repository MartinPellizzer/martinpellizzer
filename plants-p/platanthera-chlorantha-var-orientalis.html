<p>Platanthera chlorantha var. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental yellow twayblade, is a rare and delicate orchid native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and wetlands. It has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
