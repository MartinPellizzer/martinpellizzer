<p>Pedicularis rex subsp.</p>
<p>pseudocyathus, commonly known as the King's Crown, is a striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Native to the mountainous regions of Europe, it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its most distinctive feature is its vivid red, spurred flowers that resemble a crown, hence its common name.</p>
<p>The plant is relatively rare and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
