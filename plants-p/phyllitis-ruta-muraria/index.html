                            <h1>Phyllitis Ruta-Muraria</h1>
<p>Mouse-ear chickweed, scientifically known as Phyllitis ruta-muraria, is a small, low-growing plant commonly found in moist, disturbed soils across temperate regions. It is characterized by its hairy leaves and clusters of small white flowers that bloom in early spring. Despite its delicate appearance, this plant is resilient and often thrives in urban and rural environments alike. Its name derives from the shape of its leaves, which resemble tiny mouse ears, and its tendency to grow in walls and along pathways. Mouse-ear chickweed has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
