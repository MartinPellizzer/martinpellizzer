<p>Panax pancheri, commonly known as the Korean ginseng, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Korea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, tuberous roots that are highly valued for their medicinal properties. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring compound leaves with serrated edges and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its roots contain various bioactive compounds, including ginsenosides, which are believed to contribute to its reputation as an adaptogen.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Panax pancheri is now considered an endangered species in its native range.</p>
