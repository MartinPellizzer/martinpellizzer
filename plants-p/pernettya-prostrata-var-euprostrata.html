                    <h1>Pernettya prostrata var. euprostrata</h1>
<p>Pernettya prostrata var. euprostrata, commonly known as the prostrate cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, leathery leaves that are dark green and often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, followed by bright red berries that are edible but tart. It thrives in rocky, acidic soils and is adapted to cold climates with long winters.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its prostrate growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, wind-swept environments.</p>
