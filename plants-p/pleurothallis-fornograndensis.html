<p>It is a small to medium-sized epiphytic orchid, characterized by its elongated, fleshy pseudobulbs and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with prominent lip structures, typical of many pleurothallis species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range.</p>
