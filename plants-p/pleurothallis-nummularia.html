<p>Pleurothallis nummularia, commonly known as the silver leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
