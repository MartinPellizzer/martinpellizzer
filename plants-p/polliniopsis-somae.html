<p>Polliniopsis somae, commonly known as the Somalian polliniopsis, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the arid regions of Somalia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, characterized by its specialized floral structures and intricate pollination mechanisms. The plant exhibits unique adaptations to its harsh environment, including reduced leaf size and a highly modified inflorescence. Its flowers are small and often inconspicuous, relying on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species with minimal ecological data available.</p>
