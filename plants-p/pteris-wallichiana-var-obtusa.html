                    <h1>Pteris wallichiana var. obtusa</h1>
<p>Pteris wallichiana var. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a prominent midrib. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in dense forest understories.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its more rounded and broader leaflets compared to the typical form of Pteris wallichiana.</p>
