<p>Psiadia integerrima, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Psiadia integerrima is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
