                    <h1>Pennisetum polystachion f. viviparum</h1>
<p>Pennisetum polystachion f. viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous fountain grass, is a variant of the fountain grass species native to Africa.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, fountain-like arrangement of leaves. It produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers that are often pink or purple in color. One of its notable botanical features is the viviparous condition, where seeds germinate on the parent plant before being dispersed.</p>
<p>This trait makes it unique among grasses and contributes to its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
