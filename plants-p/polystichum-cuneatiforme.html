                    <h1>Polystichum cuneatiforme</h1>
<p>Polystichum cuneatiforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a robust rhizome system that supports its upright, arching fronds. The fronds are typically bi- to tri-pinnate, with finely divided, lance-shaped pinnae that give the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
