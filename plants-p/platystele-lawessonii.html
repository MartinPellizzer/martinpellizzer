                    <h1>Platystele lawessonii</h1>
<p>Platystele lawessonii, commonly known as the Philippine ghost orchid, is a rare and critically endangered epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches in tropical rainforests. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, and it has no leaves, relying solely on its roots and flowers for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is highly threatened and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
