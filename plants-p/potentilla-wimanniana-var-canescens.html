                    <h1>Potentilla wimanniana var. canescens</h1>
<p>Potentilla wimanniana var. canescens, commonly known as the silver potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate touch of color to its compact form. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
