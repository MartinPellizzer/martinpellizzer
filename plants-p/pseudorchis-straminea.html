<p>Pseudorchis straminea, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to various regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a slender, leafless stem that bears small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike.
