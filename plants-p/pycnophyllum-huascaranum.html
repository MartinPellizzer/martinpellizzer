                    <h1>Pycnophyllum huascaranum</h1>
<p>Pycnophyllum huascaranum, commonly known as the Andean mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, such as Polylepis, through a specialized root system called haustoria. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
