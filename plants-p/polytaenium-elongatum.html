                    <h1>Polytaenium elongatum</h1>
<p>Polytaenium elongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed water plant, is a aquatic plant native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It features long, slender stems that can grow several meters in length, often floating on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, helping it to spread across the water's surface.</p>
<p>It is often used in ornamental ponds and wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
