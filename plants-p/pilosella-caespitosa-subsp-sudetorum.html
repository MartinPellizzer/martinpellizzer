<p>Pilosella caespitosa subsp.</p>
<p>sudetorum, commonly known as the Sudeten hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe. It forms dense, mat-like growths with compact, tufted stems and small, daisy-like flowers.</p>
<p>The plant has silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in stabilizing soil in marginal environments.</p>
