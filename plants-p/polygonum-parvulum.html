                    <h1>Polygonum parvulum</h1>
<p>Polygonum parvulum, commonly known as dwarf knotweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically reaches heights of only a few inches, with slender, upright stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in wetlands.</p>
<p>Polygonum parvulum is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species.</p>
