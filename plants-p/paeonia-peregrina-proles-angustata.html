                    <h1>Paeonia peregrina proles angustata</h1>
<p>Paeonia peregrina proles angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved peony, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, single or double pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cold winter dormancy period to initiate flowering. It is closely related to other peony species but is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
