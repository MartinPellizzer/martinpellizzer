                    <h1>Polyspora nivea</h1>
<p>Polyspora nivea, commonly known as the snowflake lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen that forms a thin, white to pale gray crust on tree bark, rocks, and soil. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungal partner, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in temperate regions and is used in traditional medicine for its purported antifungal properties.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and composition make it an important indicator species for environmental health.</p>
