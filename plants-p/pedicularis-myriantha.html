                    <h1>Pedicularis myriantha</h1>
<p>Pedicularis myriantha, commonly known as the many-flowered lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow or orange-red flowers.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
