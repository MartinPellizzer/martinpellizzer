                    <h1>Pedicularis tricolor var. aequiretusa</h1>
<p>Pedicularis tricolor var. aequiretusa, commonly known as the three-color lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its strikingly colorful flowers that display red, yellow, and white petals. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for nutrients while still performing some photosynthesis. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its unique floral morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
