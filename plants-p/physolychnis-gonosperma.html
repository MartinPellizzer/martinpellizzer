                    <h1>Physolychnis gonosperma</h1>
<p>Physolychnis gonosperma, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers with a distinctive star-shaped pattern, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
