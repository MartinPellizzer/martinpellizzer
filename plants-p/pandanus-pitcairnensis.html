<p>Pandanus pitcairnensis, commonly known as the Pitcairn pandanus, is a unique species native to the Pitcairn Islands in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a small, shrub-like plant characterized by its stiff, spirally arranged leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered at the base of the leaf sheaths. Its fruits are fibrous, spiky structures that contain a single seed, adapted for dispersal by water or animals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and human activity.</p>
