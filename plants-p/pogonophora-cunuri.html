<p>Pogonophora cunuri, commonly known as the Brazilian beard lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with a leathery, dark green to blackish upper surface and a lighter, often whitish underside. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide photosynthetic capabilities, while the fungal component offers structural support and protection. It is typically found on tree trunks and rocks in humid environments.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and unique morphology make it an important indicator species for ecological health.</p>
