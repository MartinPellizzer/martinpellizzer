                    <h1>Poa nutans</h1>
<p>Poa nutans, commonly known as the prostrate bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It has slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats on the ground, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as lawns, meadows, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Poa nutans is often used in horticulture for its fine texture and ability to form dense, low-maintenance turf.</p>
