<p>Pachylophus caulescens, commonly known as the thick-stemmed lichen, is a unique species characterized by its dense, compact growth form.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen, meaning it has a leaf-like structure with a distinct upper and lower surface. The plant typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in moist, shaded environments. Its thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>Pachylophus caulescens plays a vital role in ecological systems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
