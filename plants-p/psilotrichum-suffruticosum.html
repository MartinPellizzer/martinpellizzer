                    <h1>Psilotrichum suffruticosum</h1>
<p>Psilotrichum suffruticosum, commonly known as the creeping psilotum, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, leafless stems and small, sporangium-bearing shoots that resemble leaves. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a unique structure composed of rhizomes and sporophylls. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for studying early plant evolution.</p>
