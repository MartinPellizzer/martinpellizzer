                    <h1>Pyrethrum ceratophylloides var. tenuifolium</h1>
<p>Pyrethrum ceratophylloides var. tenuifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaf pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which contain potent natural insecticides called pyrethrins. These compounds make it an effective botanical pesticide, particularly against insects with exoskeletons.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental and pest-control gardening.</p>
