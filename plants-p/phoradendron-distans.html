                    <h1>Phoradendron distans</h1>
<p>Phoradendron distans, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using the limited chlorophyll it possesses. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is often found in forest canopies.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing food for wildlife and influencing the health of its host trees.</p>
