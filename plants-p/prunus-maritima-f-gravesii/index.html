                            <h1>Prunus Maritima F. Gravesii</h1>
<p>Coastal cherry, scientifically known as Prunus maritima f. gravesii, is a rare and resilient shrub native to the sandy shores of the northeastern United States. This plant thrives in harsh coastal environments, enduring salt spray, strong winds, and shifting sands. Its compact form and small, fragrant flowers make it a unique addition to maritime landscapes. Despite its delicate appearance, the coastal cherry is highly adaptable and plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local wildlife. Its survival is a testament to nature's ability to flourish in even the most challenging conditions.</p>
