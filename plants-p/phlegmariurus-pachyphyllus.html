                    <h1>Phlegmariurus pachyphyllus</h1>
<p>Phlegmariurus pachyphyllus, commonly known as the thick-leaf marsh moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with thick, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern. It is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense, and relies on rhizoids for anchorage.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes and its role in soil stabilization.</p>
