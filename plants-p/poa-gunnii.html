                    <h1>Poa gunnii</h1>
<p>Poa gunnii, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, which allows it to thrive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes where it forms dense mats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, Poa gunnii is also cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
