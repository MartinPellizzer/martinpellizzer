                    <h1>Phyllitis durvillei</h1>
<p>Phyllitis durvillei, commonly known as the Durville's water clover, is a rare aquatic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into small, oval-shaped segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Phyllitis durvillei is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
