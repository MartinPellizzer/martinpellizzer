                    <h1>Pinus pumilio</h1>
<p>Pinus pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a small coniferous tree native to the alpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, twisted trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in harsh, high-altitude environments with limited soil and cold temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important ecological role in mountain ecosystems.</p>
