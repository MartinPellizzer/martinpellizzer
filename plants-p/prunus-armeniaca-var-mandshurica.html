<p>Prunus armeniaca var. mandshurica, commonly known as the Manchurian apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar to apricots but often smaller and more tart. The plant has a rugged, branched structure with thick, grey bark and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in temperate climates and is valued for its ornamental appeal and fruit yield.</p>
<p>The variety is particularly hardy, making it suitable for colder regions compared to other apricot species.</p>
