                    <h1>Pinus monticola f. porphyrocarpa</h1>
<p>Pinus monticola f. porphyrocarpa, commonly known as the red bark lodgepole pine, is a variant of the lodgepole pine native to the western United States.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown bark, which is thicker and more fissured than that of the typical form. It typically grows in high-elevation forests, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The cones are small and serotinous, releasing seeds after forest fires, which is an adaptation to its fire-prone habitat.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of subalpine ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
