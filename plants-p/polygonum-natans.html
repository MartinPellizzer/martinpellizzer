                    <h1>Polygonum natans</h1>
<p>Polygonum natans, commonly known as floating bladderwort, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating, leafless stems that bear small, spathulate leaves and tiny, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its roots are specialized for anchoring in water and absorbing nutrients, while its stems are buoyant due to air-filled cavities.</p>
<p>Polygonum natans plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
