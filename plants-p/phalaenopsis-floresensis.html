                    <h1>Phalaenopsis floresensis</h1>
<p>Phalaenopsis floresensis, commonly known as the Flores orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Flores in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its elegant, long-lasting flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its tropical rainforest habitat. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture, and it prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Phalaenopsis floresensis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
