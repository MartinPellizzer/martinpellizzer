                    <h1>Polygonum fallax</h1>
<p>Polygonum fallax, commonly known as the silverleaf knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species.</p>
