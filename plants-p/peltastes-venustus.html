                    <h1>Peltastes venustus</h1>
<p>Peltastes venustus, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique plant characterized by its intricate, feathery foliage that resembles delicate lace.</p>
<p>Native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in shaded, moist environments with high humidity. Its leaves are covered in a fine, velvety layer of microscopic hairs, which aid in water retention and protection from herbivores. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Peltastes venustus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
