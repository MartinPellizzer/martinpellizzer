<p>Paspalum melanospermum, commonly known as blackseed grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black seeds that are highly valued in traditional medicine and as a spice. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous structure that contributes to its resilience.</p>
<p>The flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain the distinctive black seeds.</p>
