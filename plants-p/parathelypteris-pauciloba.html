<p>Parathelypteris pauciloba, commonly known as the few-leaved water fern, is a small, delicate fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a narrow, lance-shaped outline and a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
