<p>Puccinellia borealis subsp.</p>
<p>neglecta, commonly known as the northern glassworts, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, often bluish-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to cold climates and nutrient-poor substrates.</p>
