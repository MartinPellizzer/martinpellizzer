<p>Plantago oreades var. vegeta, commonly known as the mountain plantain, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It features upright, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for their mild astringent properties.</p>
