                    <h1>Pedicularis aschistorrhyncha</h1>
<p>Pedicularis aschistorrhyncha, commonly known as the narrow-flowered lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically pink or red, with a distinctive bilabiate corolla. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
