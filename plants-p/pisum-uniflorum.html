                    <h1>Pisum uniflorum</h1>
<p>Pisum uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower pea, is a lesser-known legume species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant produces elliptical, dark green pods that contain one to three seeds, which are often used in traditional herbal medicine. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family, and it thrives in well-drained soils with moderate sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its limited cultivation, much of its botanical study remains underexplored compared to more common pea species.</p>
