                    <h1>Pedicularis angustilabris</h1>
<p>Pedicularis angustilabris, commonly known as the narrow-lipped monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically pink or violet in color, with a distinctive, elongated labellum. It thrives in rocky, acidic soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
