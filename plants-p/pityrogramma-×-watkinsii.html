                    <h1>Pityrogramma × watkinsii</h1>
<p>Pityrogramma × watkinsii, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Pityrogramma calomelanos and Pityrogramma mirabilis.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green to yellow-green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The hybrid nature of Pityrogramma × watkinsii makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
