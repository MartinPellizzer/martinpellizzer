                    <h1>Pinus nigra var. maritima</h1>
<p>Pinus nigra var. maritima, commonly known as the Maritime Pine, is a resilient evergreen conifer native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, needle-like leaves that are typically grouped in bundles of two. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural range expansion. Its root system is adapted to withstand salt spray and poor soil conditions, making it well-suited for coastal environments.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines.</p>
