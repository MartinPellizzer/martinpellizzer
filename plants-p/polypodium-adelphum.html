<p>Polypodium adelphum, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature in ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Polypodium adelphum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
