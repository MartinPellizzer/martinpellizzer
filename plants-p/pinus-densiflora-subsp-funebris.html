<p>Pinus densiflora subsp.</p>
<p>funebris, commonly known as the Japanese black pine, is a variant of the Japanese white pine native to southern Japan. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and dense, dark green needles that are slightly longer than those of the typical species.</p>
<p>The cones are slender and often remain attached to the branches for a long time, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental tree in gardens and parks.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its resilience and aesthetic appeal, especially in traditional Japanese landscapes.</p>
