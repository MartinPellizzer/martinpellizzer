                    <h1>Psyllocarpus pruinosus</h1>
<p>Psyllocarpus pruinosus, commonly known as the glossy ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, glossy bark and dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and covered with a waxy coating. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a shade tree in tropical landscapes.</p>
