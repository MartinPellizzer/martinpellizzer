                    <h1>Phoradendron forestierae</h1>
<p>Phoradendron forestierae, commonly known as the forestier's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and relies on its host for water and some nutrients while producing its own food through photosynthesis. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often visited by insects for pollination. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, are an important food source for birds and other animals.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to form dense clusters on its host, sometimes leading to the death of the tree if the infestation is severe.</p>
