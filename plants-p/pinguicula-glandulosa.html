                    <h1>Pinguicula glandulosa</h1>
<p>Pinguicula glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant's structure includes specialized bladders that digest captured prey, providing essential nutrients. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an interesting subject for both ecological and botanical study.</p>
