<p>Pseudoclappia arenaria, commonly known as the sand dune grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy and saline environments, often found in dune ecosystems. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically green or white, adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>Pseudoclappia arenaria plays a vital role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
