<p>Phyllolobium pastorium, commonly known as the white clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a white or pale yellow marking at the base. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, and it is well-known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Phyllolobium pastorium is widely used in pastures and as a cover crop due to its hardiness and nutritional value for livestock.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in lawns and agricultural fields.</p>
