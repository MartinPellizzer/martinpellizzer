                    <h1>Picea excelsa subvar. angustata</h1>
<p>Picea excelsa subvar. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white spruce, is a subspecies of the white spruce native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are narrower than those of the typical white spruce. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and its bark is typically thin and scaly. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in subalpine and alpine zones.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its timber and its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
