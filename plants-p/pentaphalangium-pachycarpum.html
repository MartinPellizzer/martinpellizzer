                    <h1>Pentaphalangium pachycarpum</h1>
<p>Pentaphalangium pachycarpum, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern that thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant has a complex rhizome system that anchors it to the substrate and supports its extensive growth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its size and ecological role, it plays a significant part in maintaining water quality and biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
