<p>Phleum ovatum, commonly known as slender oat, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems that are typically less than 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Phleum ovatum is valued for its ecological role in supporting insect pollinators and as a forage crop for livestock.</p>
