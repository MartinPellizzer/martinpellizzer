                    <h1>Polypodium × vianei</h1>
<p>Polypodium × vianei, commonly known as the hybrid wall fern, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Polypodium appalachianum and Polypodium polyanthum. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist areas, forming dense, mat-like colonies. Its fronds are pinnate, with a broad, leathery texture and a distinctive, upright growth habit.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
