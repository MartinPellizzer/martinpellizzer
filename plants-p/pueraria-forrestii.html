<p>Pueraria forrestii, commonly known as the Chinese kudzu, is a vigorous climbing legume native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves that are pinnately arranged and often have a heart-shaped base. The plant produces showy, purple or violet pea-like flowers that bloom in racemes. Its roots are tuberous and can grow quite large, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions.</p>
<p>Pueraria forrestii is closely related to other kudzu species and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties.</p>
