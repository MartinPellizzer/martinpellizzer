<p>The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and the pods contain small, edible seeds. This subspecies is often cultivated for its compact growth habit, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for study in plant morphology and genetics.</p>
