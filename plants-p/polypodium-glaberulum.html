                    <h1>Polypodium glaberulum</h1>
<p>Polypodium glaberulum, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
