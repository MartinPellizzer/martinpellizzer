<p>Pityrogramma × cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban water fern, is a hybrid species within the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate fern characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as along stream banks or in humid forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
