                    <h1>Populus trichocarpa f. ingrata</h1>
<p>Populus trichocarpa f. ingrata, commonly known as the roughleaf cottonwood, is a variant of the black cottonwood characterized by its rugged, irregular bark and smaller, more densely packed leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to the western United States, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows in riparian zones and is adapted to flood-prone environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a distinctive, somewhat fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>This form is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
