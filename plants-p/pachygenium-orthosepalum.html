                    <h1>Pachygenium orthosepalum</h1>
<p>Pachygenium orthosepalum, commonly known as the broad-sepal orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy sepals and petals, which are adapted to the harsh, cold climate of its habitat. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters along the stem. Its root system is highly specialized, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Pachygenium orthosepalum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
