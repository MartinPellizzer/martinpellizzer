                    <h1>Patagonium humile</h1>
<p>Patagonium humile, commonly known as the dwarf Patagonian lichen, is a small, crust-like lichen that thrives in harsh, arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tightly packed growth form, which helps it retain moisture in extreme conditions. The plant is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It is typically found in Patagonia and other high-altitude regions with strong sunlight and low humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental change.</p>
