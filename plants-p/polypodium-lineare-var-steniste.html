                    <h1>Polypodium lineare var. steniste</h1>
<p>Polypodium lineare var. steniste, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a variant of the common polypody.</p>
<p>It is a fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky or wooded slopes. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, allowing it to spread slowly over time.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, ovate pinnae that are closely spaced along the rachis.</p>
