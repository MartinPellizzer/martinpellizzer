                    <h1>Poa breviglumis var. moarii</h1>
<p>Poa breviglumis var. moarii, commonly known as the Moari's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense, mat-like vegetation. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, temperate environments, often found in wetlands and along the edges of streams.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
