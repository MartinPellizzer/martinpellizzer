                    <h1>Pilea rhizobola</h1>
<p>Pilea rhizobola, commonly known as the water shield, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has heart-shaped, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in shallow water environments.</p>
<p>Pilea rhizobola is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
