                    <h1>Pyrus pyrifolia f. pallescens</h1>
<p>Pyrus pyrifolia f. pallescens, commonly known as the pale-leaved Chinese pear, is a unique variant of the Chinese pear tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost white, foliage, which distinguishes it from the typical green leaves of the species. This form exhibits a more delicate appearance and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. The plant retains the typical fruiting habits of Pyrus pyrifolia, producing edible pears under suitable conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical interest lies in its distinct leaf coloration and its role in horticultural variation.</p>
