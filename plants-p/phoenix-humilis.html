                    <h1>Phoenix humilis</h1>
<p>Phoenix humilis, commonly known as the desert fan palm, is a small, low-growing palm native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has a short, trunk-like stem with a crown of narrow, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is adapted to hot, dry climates and can survive with minimal water due to its succulent leaves and deep root system. It produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
