                    <h1>Pinus elliottii</h1>
<p>Pinus elliottii, commonly known as the slash pine, is a tall evergreen conifer native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, needle-like leaves that grow in bundles of two, and its distinctive pine cones that are typically yellow when mature. The tree produces a resinous sap that has been historically used for various purposes, including the production of turpentine. It thrives in wetland habitats and is often found in coastal areas and swamp forests.</p>
<p>The slash pine plays an important ecological role in its native range, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability.</p>
