<p>Piptanthocereus cipoensis, commonly known as the Cipo Thorned Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often covered in spines, which provide protection against herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments.</p>
<p>This cactus is well adapted to desert conditions and plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
