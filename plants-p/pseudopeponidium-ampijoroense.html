<p>Pseudopeponidium ampijoroense, commonly known as the Ampijoroan ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with elongated, pale green pseudobulbs and delicate, translucent leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, adapted for specific pollinators in its native habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree bark or in rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
