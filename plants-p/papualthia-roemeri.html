<p>Papualthia roemeri, commonly known as the desert honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow-orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and desert scrublands. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Papualthia roemeri plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and hummingbirds.</p>
