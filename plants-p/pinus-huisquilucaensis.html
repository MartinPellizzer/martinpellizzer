                    <h1>Pinus huisquilucaensis</h1>
<p>Pinus huisquilucaensis, commonly known as the Huisquiluca pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and conical shape, typical of many pine species. The tree produces small, woody cones that mature over several years, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its botanical features reflect adaptations to its harsh, mountainous environment, including drought resistance and cold tolerance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for ecological and conservation studies.</p>
