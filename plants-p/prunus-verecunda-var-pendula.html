                    <h1>Prunus verecunda var. pendula</h1>
<p>Prunus verecunda var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping cherry or weeping almond, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its weeping habit, with long, cascading branches that create a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in early spring, typically pink or white, which bloom before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and oval in shape, turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, hard drupe that ripens in late summer, though it is not typically consumed by humans.</p>
