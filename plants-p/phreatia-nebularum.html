<p>Phreatia nebularum, commonly known as the nebular orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches in rainforests. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with white petals and a distinctive purple lip. Its root system is adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Phreatia nebularum is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs.</p>
