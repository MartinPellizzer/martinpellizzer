                    <h1>Platanthera virescens</h1>
<p>Platanthera virescens, commonly known as the greenish twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has reduced foliage, relying on its roots for photosynthesis. It thrives in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks, where it forms dense colonies.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of wetland health.</p>
