                    <h1>Polybotrya arfakensis</h1>
<p>Polybotrya arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfak mountain fern, is a unique species native to the highlands of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that exhibit a distinct dichotomous branching pattern. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in shaded forest understories. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, with sporangia clustered in sori along the margins of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
