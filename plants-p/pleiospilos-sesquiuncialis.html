<p>[WRONG START] Pleiosprios sesquiuncialis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking succulent native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, bulbous shape and a distinctive, spiky crown of leaves that resembles a ghostly figure. The plant stores water in its thick, fleshy stem, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. It produces vibrant yellow flowers during the rainy season, adding a dramatic visual contrast to its otherwise muted appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
