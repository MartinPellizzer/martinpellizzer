<p>Potamogeton pectinatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments across Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in shallow, slow-moving waters, where it can form dense underwater vegetation. Its roots help stabilize sediment, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and fish.</p>
<p>Potamogeton pectinatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ecological benefits.</p>
