<p>Polypodium japonense, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure, providing protection to the fertile spore-bearing structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both vegetative and reproductive shoots.</p>
<p>Polypodium japonense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
