                    <h1>Phoradendron cooperi</h1>
<p>Phoradendron cooperi, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Phoradendron cooperi plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
