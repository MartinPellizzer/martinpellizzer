<p>It features dense, fleshy foliage with a variety of leaf shapes, often including notched or lobed margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its trailing growth habit makes it an excellent choice for hanging baskets or as a cascading plant in indoor spaces.</p>
