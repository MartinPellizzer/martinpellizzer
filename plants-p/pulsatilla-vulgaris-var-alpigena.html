                    <h1>Pulsatilla vulgaris var. alpigena</h1>
<p>Pulsatilla vulgaris var. alpigena, commonly known as the alpine pasqueflower, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, sunny conditions. Its leaves are deeply divided and resemble those of a fern, while its stems are usually unbranched and covered in a fine, white down.</p>
<p>The alpine pasqueflower is a short-lived perennial, often blooming in early spring before the snow has fully melted.</p>
