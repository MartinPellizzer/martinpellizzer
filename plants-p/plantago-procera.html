                    <h1>Plantago procera</h1>
<p>Plantago procera, commonly known as tall plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, three-lobed capsule, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Plantago procera is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
