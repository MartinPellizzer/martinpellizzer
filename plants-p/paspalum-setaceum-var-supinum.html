<p>Paspalum setaceum var. supinum, commonly known as the creeping paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often grow close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along waterways.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate flooding, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
