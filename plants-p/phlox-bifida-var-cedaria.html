                    <h1>Phlox bifida var. cedaria</h1>
<p>Phlox bifida var. cedaria, commonly known as the Cedar Hill phlox, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features showy, fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves and a branching habit that makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
