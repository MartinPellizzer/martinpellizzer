                    <h1>Poa stricta</h1>
<p>Poa stricta, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns and has fine, wiry leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in shaded woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, Poa stricta is sometimes used in turfgrass mixtures and ecological restoration projects.</p>
