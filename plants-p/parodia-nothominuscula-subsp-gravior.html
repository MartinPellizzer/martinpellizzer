<p>Parodia nothominuscula subsp.</p>
<p>gravior, commonly known as the small-spined parodia, is a compact cactus native to southern Africa. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure and is covered in dense, white to pale blue spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections.</p>
