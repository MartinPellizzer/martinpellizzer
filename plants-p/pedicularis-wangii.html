                    <h1>Pedicularis wangii</h1>
<p>Pedicularis wangii, commonly known as the golden monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its specialized roots. The plant produces striking red-orange flowers with a distinctive spurred shape, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Pedicularis wangii is considered a delicate and endangered species.</p>
