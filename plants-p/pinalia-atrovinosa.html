                    <h1>Pinalia atrovinosa</h1>
<p>Pinalia atrovinosa, commonly known as the black-vine pinalia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Pinaliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pinalia atrovinosa is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
