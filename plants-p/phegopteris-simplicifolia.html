                    <h1>Phegopteris simplicifolia</h1>
<p>Phegopteris simplicifolia, commonly known as the simple-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, floating fronds that are often divided into small, lance-shaped segments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Phegopteris simplicifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling.</p>
