<p>Polypodium pulcherrimum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, golden hairs, giving it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
