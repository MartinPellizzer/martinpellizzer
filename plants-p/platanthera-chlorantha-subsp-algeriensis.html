<p>Platanthera chlorantha subsp.</p>
<p>algeriensis, commonly known as the Algerian green twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland edges and marshy areas. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
