                    <h1>Phoradendron berryi</h1>
<p>Phoradendron berryi, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It produces small, fleshy berries that are typically red or yellow, which serve as a food source for birds and other animals. The berries contain seeds that are dispersed through the droppings of these animals, allowing the plant to colonize new hosts. The plant's leaves are evergreen, and it has a symbiotic relationship with its host, drawing water and nutrients while also providing some ecological benefits.</p>
<p>Its presence can affect the health and growth of the host tree, making it an important component of forest ecosystems.</p>
