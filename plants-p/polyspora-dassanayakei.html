                    <h1>Polyspora dassanayakei</h1>
<p>Polyspora dassanayakei, commonly known as the Sri Lankan polypore, is a rare fungal species native to the tropical regions of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polyporaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, tough, and leathery cap. The fruiting bodies typically grow on dead wood, forming a bracket-like structure. Its spore-bearing surface is covered in tiny pores rather than gills, a feature common in polypores.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to mycologists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
