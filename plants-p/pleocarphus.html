                    <h1>Pleocarphus</h1>
<p>Pleocarphus, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of vascular plants belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, scale-like leaves and the presence of specialized structures called stomata. They are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Pleocarphus species are often mistaken for mosses due to their appearance, but they are actually more closely related to ferns.</p>
<p>Their reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are borne on specialized branches called strobila.</p>
