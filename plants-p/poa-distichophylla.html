                    <h1>Poa distichophylla</h1>
<p>Poa distichophylla, commonly known as the two-leaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers, making it monoecious. Its leaves are often covered with fine hairs, and it prefers moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands.</p>
<p>Poa distichophylla plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies.</p>
