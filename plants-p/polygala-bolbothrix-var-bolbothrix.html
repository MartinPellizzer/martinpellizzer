                    <h1>Polygala bolbothrix var. bolbothrix</h1>
<p>Polygala bolbothrix var. bolbothrix, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Polygalaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, orchid-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is found primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
