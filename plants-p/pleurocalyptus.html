<p>Pleurocalyptus, commonly known as the broad-leafed cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically growing on separate plants.
