                    <h1>Panax balansae</h1>
<p>Panax balansae, commonly known as the Balansae ginseng, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that contain the seeds. Its roots, similar to other ginseng species, are valued for their potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically threatened in the wild.</p>
