                    <h1>Phaeanthus ophthalmicus</h1>
<p>Phaeanthus ophthalmicus, commonly known as the eye-flower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble eyes, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phaeanthus ophthalmicus is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation efforts.</p>
