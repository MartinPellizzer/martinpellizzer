                    <h1>Pothos scandens f. angustior</h1>
<p>Pothos scandens f. angustior, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ivy, is a compact, trailing vine native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are narrower than those of the standard Pothos scandens. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is primarily cultivated for its foliage rather than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to maintain healthy growth.</p>
<p>This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ease of care and attractive, cascading appearance.</p>
