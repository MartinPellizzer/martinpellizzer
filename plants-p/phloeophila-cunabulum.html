<p>Phloeophila cunabulum, commonly known as the mountain phloeophila, is a rare shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are followed by distinctive, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
