                    <h1>Peucedanum uliginosum</h1>
<p>Peucedanum uliginosum, commonly known as water hogweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like clusters of small white or greenish flowers. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near streams, ditches, and marshy regions.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation and is sometimes considered a weed.</p>
