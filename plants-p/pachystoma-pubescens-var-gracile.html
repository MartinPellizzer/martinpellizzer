                    <h1>Pachystoma pubescens var. gracile</h1>
<p>Pachystoma pubescens var. gracile, commonly known as the slender desert bell, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically during the spring or early summer. Its pubescent (hairy) surface helps reduce water loss and provides some protection against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>This variant is a hardy, low-maintenance plant well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
