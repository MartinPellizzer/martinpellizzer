                    <h1>Piscaria</h1>
<p>Piscaria, commonly known as the "water starwort," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of freshwater bodies, where they thrive in moist to aquatic conditions. Piscaria species are characterized by their small, clustered flowers and smooth, sometimes waxy leaves. They often have a creeping growth habit, with some species forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Piscaria fistulosa and Piscaria rupicola, which are valued for their ecological roles and ornamental appeal.</p>
