                    <h1>Picea firma</h1>
<p>Picea firma, commonly known as the white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Picea firma thrives in cold climates and is often found in boreal forests and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Its wood is valued for its strength and resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and paper production.</p>
