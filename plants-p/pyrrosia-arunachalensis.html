                    <h1>Pyrrosia arunachalensis</h1>
<p>Pyrrosia arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in montane forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This fern is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
