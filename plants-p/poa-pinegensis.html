                    <h1>Poa pinegensis</h1>
<p>Poa pinegensis, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often forming dense mats that stabilize rocky or barren terrain. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce wind-pollinated flowers, a common reproductive strategy in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
<p>Poa pinegensis plays an important ecological role in preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna.</p>
