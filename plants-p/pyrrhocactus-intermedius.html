<p>Pyrrhocactus intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate pyrrhocactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a typical adaptation for survival in dry environments.</p>
<p>Pyrrhocactus intermedius is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
