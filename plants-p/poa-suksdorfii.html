<p>Poa suksdorfii, commonly known as Saksdorf's meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine soils, and is adapted to cold and dry conditions. The plant has slender,丛生 (clump-forming) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Poa suksdorfii is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique adaptations to harsh environments and its role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
