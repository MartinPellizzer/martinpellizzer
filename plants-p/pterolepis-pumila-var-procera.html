<p>Pterolepis pumila var. procera, commonly known as the tall dwarf lichen, is a unique variant of the dwarf lichen species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, crust-like growth form, typically found on rocky surfaces in arid environments. The plant exhibits a pale to dark green coloration, with a dense thallus that adheres tightly to its substrate. It is a non-photosynthetic organism, relying on its symbiotic association with algae for nutrients.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions, making it an important indicator species in certain ecosystems.</p>
