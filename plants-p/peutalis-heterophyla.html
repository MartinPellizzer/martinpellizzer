                    <h1>Peutalis heterophyla</h1>
<p>Peutalis heterophyla, commonly known as the variable peat moss, is a species of peat moss found in moist, acidic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spongy growth habit and its ability to retain water, making it an important component of peatland ecosystems. The plant has a complex structure with both stem and leaf-like structures, which contribute to its ecological role in soil formation. It is often found in bogs and wetlands, where it plays a crucial role in carbon sequestration.</p>
<p>Its morphology and habitat preferences make it a key indicator species for assessing the health of wetland environments.</p>
