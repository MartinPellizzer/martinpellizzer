                    <h1>Poa buckleyana</h1>
<p>Poa buckleyana, commonly known as Buckley's bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features fine, blue-green blades that form dense, mat-like growth, often carpeting rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate floral display. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in challenging environments.</p>
