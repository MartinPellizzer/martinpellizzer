<p>Phlegmariurus tico, commonly known as the Tico clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping stem with whorls of small, scale-like leaves that contribute to its dense, mat-like growth form. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, releasing them from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to thrive in humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
