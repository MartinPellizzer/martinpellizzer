<p>Pritchardia beccariana var. giffardiana, commonly known as the Giffard's breadfruit, is a rare and endemic palm species native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by edible, breadfruit-like drupes. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
