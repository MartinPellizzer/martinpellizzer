<p>Pseudacoridium anfractum, commonly known as the wrinkled coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, coral-like inflorescence that consists of small, clustered flowers with a distinctive, wrinkled appearance. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, making it a mycoheterotroph. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it blooms during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth habits and habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and elusive species.</p>
