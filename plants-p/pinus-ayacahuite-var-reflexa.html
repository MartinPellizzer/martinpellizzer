<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in clusters of five. The cones of this species are woody and can persist on the tree for many years, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and potential for ornamental use.</p>
