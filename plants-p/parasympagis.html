<p>Parasympagis, commonly known as the "false lily," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Melanthiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and showy, often white or pink, flower clusters that resemble lilies. The plants typically grow in moist, temperate regions and are often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Parasympagis species are perennial herbs that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Their botanical features make them distinct from true lilies, which belong to the Liliaceae family.</p>
