<p>Polypodium koordersii, commonly known as the koord's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments such as mountain forests and rock crevices.</p>
<p>The fronds are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its natural habitat.</p>
