<p>Pachygenium yungasense, commonly known as the Yungas pachygenium, is a rare and unique plant species native to the humid forests of the Yungas region in Bolivia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, and is characterized by its distinctive, sprawling growth habit. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Pachygenium yungasense is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
