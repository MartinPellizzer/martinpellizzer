                    <h1>Pterostylis falcata</h1>
<p>Pterostylis falcata, commonly known as the sickle-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, sickle-shaped leaves and a single, slender flowering stem that produces a single, greenish-yellow flower. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and understoreys. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insect species, often bees and wasps.</p>
<p>The orchid's morphology reflects its evolutionary adaptations to its ecological niche.</p>
