                    <h1>Primula tyrolensis</h1>
<p>Primula tyrolensis, commonly known as the Tyrol primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture.</p>
