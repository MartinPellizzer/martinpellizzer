<p>Pteris tripinnatifida, commonly known as the three-pinnate water fern, is a species of fern native to Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are divided into multiple pinnae, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in the soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually light green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to aquatic or humid gardens.</p>
