                    <h1>Polypodium undulatosinuatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium undulatosinuatum, commonly known as the undulating fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that exhibit a wavy, undulating pattern. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to absorb moisture and nutrients from its substrate.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in its survival in low-light conditions.</p>
