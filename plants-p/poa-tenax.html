                    <h1>Poa tenax</h1>
<p>Poa tenax, commonly known as tough bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense, carpet-like turf. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray hue, and it produces small, spikelet-based flowers during the spring and summer. Poa tenax is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and establish itself effectively in different environments.</p>
