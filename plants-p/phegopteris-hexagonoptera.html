<p>Phegopteris hexagonoptera, commonly known as the eastern sword fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving them a finely divided, feathery appearance. The leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a distinctive, elongated shape that resembles a sword. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a characteristic feature of ferns.</p>
