                    <h1>Picea finedonensis</h1>
<p>Picea finedonensis, commonly known as the Finedon pine, is a rare and endangered species native to the Scottish Highlands.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous tree belonging to the family Pinaceae, characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The tree typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, moist climate of its native habitat. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
