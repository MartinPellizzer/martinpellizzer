<p>Pilosocereus pachycladus subsp.</p>
<p>viridis, commonly known as the green cholla, is a spineless cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, branching stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, greenish hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. Its ability to store water in its thick stems makes it well adapted to desert environments.</p>
<p>Despite its non-spiny appearance, it is still a hardy and resilient species that thrives in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
