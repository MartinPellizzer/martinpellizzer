<p>Parnassia palustris subsp.</p>
<p>obtusiflora, commonly known as the blunt-flowered white crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a basal rosette of broadly ovate, waxy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers with prominent yellow stamens, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
