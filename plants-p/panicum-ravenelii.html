<p>Panicum ravenelii, commonly known as purpletop millet, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking purple-tinted foliage and upright growth habit, which makes it visually appealing in gardens and landscapes. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. It is drought-tolerant and often used as a ornamental grass or for erosion control.</p>
<p>Its seeds are small and light, dispersing easily by wind, which aids in its natural propagation.</p>
