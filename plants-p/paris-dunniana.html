<p>Paris dunniana, commonly known as the black hellebore, is a rare and striking member of the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. The plant features dark green, waxy leaves that are typically heart-shaped and can grow up to 30 cm in length. Its flowers, which are clustered in a spadix surrounded by a spathe, are usually deep purple or black, giving it its dramatic appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is considered a challenging plant to grow in cultivation.</p>
