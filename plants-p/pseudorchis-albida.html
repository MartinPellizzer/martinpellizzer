                    <h1>Pseudorchis albida</h1>
<p>Pseudorchis albida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
