<p>Polycarpon tetraphyllum subsp.</p>
<p>diphyllum, commonly known as the four-leafed knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant features a creeping rhizome system and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The subspecies diphyllum is distinguished by its two distinct leaf forms on the same plant, a characteristic that sets it apart from other members of the species.</p>
