                    <h1>Pteris quadrialata</h1>
<p>Pteris quadrialata, commonly known as the four-lobed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
