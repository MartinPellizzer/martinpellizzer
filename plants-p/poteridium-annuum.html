                    <h1>Poteridium annuum</h1>
<p>Poteridium annuum, commonly known as annual saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to harsh, saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Poteridium annuum is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ecological benefits.</p>
