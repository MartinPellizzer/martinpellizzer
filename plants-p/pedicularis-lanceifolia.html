                    <h1>Pedicularis lanceifolia</h1>
<p>Pedicularis lanceifolia, commonly known as the lanceleaf lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while photosynthesizing on its own. Native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with lance-shaped leaves and vivid red or orange flowers.</p>
<p>It is often found in open habitats such as meadows and forest clearings, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its environment.</p>
