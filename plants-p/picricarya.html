                    <h1>Picricarya</h1>
<p>Picricarya, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe, characterized by its showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers. The plants typically have hairy stems and leaves, and they produce small, round berries that are often yellow or orange in color. Picricarya species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant floral display.</p>
<p>However, they are generally not widely grown in modern horticulture due to their limited distribution and specific environmental requirements.</p>
