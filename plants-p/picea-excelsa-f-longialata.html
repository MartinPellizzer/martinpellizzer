                    <h1>Picea excelsa f. longialata</h1>
<p>Picea excelsa f. longialata, commonly known as the long-needle white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, slender needles that are typically longer than those of the typical white spruce. The plant exhibits a conical shape with a dense crown, and its bark is thin and reddish-brown, peeling in flaky strips. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with limited soil nutrients.</p>
<p>This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
