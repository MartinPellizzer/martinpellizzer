<p>Periploca visciformis, commonly known as the sticky periploca, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, somewhat sticky stems and opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
