The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, grass-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is limited due to its rough texture, but it is sometimes used in erosion control.</p>
