                    <h1>Platyelasma</h1>
<p>Platyelasma, commonly known as the flatleaf orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, broad leaves and small, intricate flowers that often have a delicate appearance. These plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Platyelasma species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their unique morphology and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
