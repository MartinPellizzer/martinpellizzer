<p>Paspalum laeve subsp.</p>
<p>circulare, commonly known as the smooth paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically smooth to the touch.</p>

<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
