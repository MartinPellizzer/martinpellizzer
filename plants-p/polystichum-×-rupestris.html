                    <h1>Polystichum × rupestris</h1>
<p>Polystichum × rupestris, commonly known as the hybrid rock fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Polystichum acutifolium and Polystichum milleflorum.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are often arched or reflexed. The plant typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, thriving in well-drained, alkaline soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shaded areas.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable spores and relies on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
