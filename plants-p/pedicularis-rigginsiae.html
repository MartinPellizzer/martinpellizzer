                    <h1>Pedicularis rigginsiae</h1>
<p>Pedicularis rigginsiae, commonly known as the Riggins' lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking red or pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically opposite and lance-shaped, adapted to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, Pedicularis rigginsiae is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
