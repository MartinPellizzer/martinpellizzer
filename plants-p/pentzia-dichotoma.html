                    <h1>Pentzia dichotoma</h1>
<p>Pentzia dichotoma, commonly known as the silver tree, is a unique succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branching structure and silvery-gray foliage, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant has a thick, woody trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive prolonged dry periods. Its small, pale flowers appear in clusters and are typically pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species.</p>
