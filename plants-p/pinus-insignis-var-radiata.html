<p>It is characterized by its straight, tall trunk and needle-like leaves that grow in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its wood is widely used in construction and paper production due to its strength and availability.</p>
<p>Radiata pine is also valued for its ecological role in providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
