                    <h1>Pleopeltis revoluta</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis revoluta, commonly known as the rolled-leaf rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and its ability to thrive on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically dark green, with a leathery texture and rolled margins that give the plant its common name. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>This fern is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to indoor growing conditions.</p>
