                    <h1>Psilathera ovata</h1>
<p>Psilathera ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaved psilathera, is a herbaceous plant native to certain regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its ovate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom during the rainy season. Psilathera ovata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
