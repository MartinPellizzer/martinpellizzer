                    <h1>Plantago maritima var. chottica</h1>
<p>Plantago maritima var. chottica, commonly known as the Chottic plantain, is a variant of the common plantain that thrives in coastal and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, typical of the Plantaginaceae family. It is adapted to grow in sandy or salty soils, often found along shorelines and in coastal dunes.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions, making it a hardy plant in marginal habitats.</p>
