<p>Primula brigantiaca, commonly known as the Alpine primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. It is well adapted to high-altitude conditions, with a short growing season and a reliance on snowmelt for moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
