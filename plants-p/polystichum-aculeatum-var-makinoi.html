<p>Polystichum aculeatum var. makinoi, commonly known as the Makino's sword fern, is a variant of the holly fern native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are densely covered with small, stiff spines along the edges. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
