<p>Phippsia langeana subsp.</p>
<p>alaskana, commonly known as the Alaska phippsia, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Alaska. It is a low-growing perennial with dense, mat-forming foliage that helps it survive in harsh Arctic conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
