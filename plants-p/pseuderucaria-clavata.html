                    <h1>Pseuderucaria clavata</h1>
<p>Pseuderucaria clavata, commonly known as the clustered clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form tight clusters. The plant produces tiny, spore-bearing cones rather than flowers, typical of its ancient lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is considered a valuable indicator species for certain forest ecosystems.</p>
