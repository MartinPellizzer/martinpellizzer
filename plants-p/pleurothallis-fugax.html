                    <h1>Pleurothallis fugax</h1>
<p>Pleurothallis fugax, commonly known as the fleeting pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom briefly, often during the rainy season. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its ephemeral blooming period and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized orchid.</p>
