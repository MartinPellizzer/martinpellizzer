                    <h1>Pityrogramma opalescens</h1>
<p>Pityrogramma opalescens, commonly known as the opalescent water clover, is a fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that display a striking opalescent sheen under light. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in humid forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
