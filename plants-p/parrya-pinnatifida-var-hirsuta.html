                    <h1>Parrya pinnatifida var. hirsuta</h1>
<p>Parrya pinnatifida var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy parrya, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas and stream banks. Its hairy foliage and unique morphology make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
