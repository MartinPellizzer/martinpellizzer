                    <h1>Pityrogramma ornithopteris f. elatior</h1>
<p>Pityrogramma ornithopteris f. elatior, commonly known as the elegant water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Pityrogramma.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, fan-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp forest floors. Its spores are produced in sori that are arranged along the margins of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
