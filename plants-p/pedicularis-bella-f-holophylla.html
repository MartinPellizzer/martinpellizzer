                    <h1>Pedicularis bella f. holophylla</h1>
<p>Pedicularis bella f. holophylla, commonly known as the white lady's mantle, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its parasitic or hemiparasitic nature, though this particular species is not fully parasitic. The plant features showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
