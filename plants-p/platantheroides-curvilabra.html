                    <h1>Platantheroides curvilabra</h1>
<p>Platantheroides curvilabra, commonly known as the twisted-leaf marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to wetland and bog habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often curved leaves and its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its morphology is adapted to its moist, often shaded environment, with a short, rhizomatous root system.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its ecological specificity and conservation status.</p>
