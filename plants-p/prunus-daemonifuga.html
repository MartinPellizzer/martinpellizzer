                    <h1>Prunus daemonifuga</h1>
<p>Prunus daemonifuga, commonly known as the devil's thorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black, thorny branches and small, elliptical leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its name, "devil's thorn," reflects both its appearance and the caution required when handling it due to its sharp spines and poisonous properties.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal despite its hazardous features.</p>
