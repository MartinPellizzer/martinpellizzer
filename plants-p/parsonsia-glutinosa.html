                    <h1>Parsonsia glutinosa</h1>
<p>Parsonsia glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky parsnip, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2â€“6 meters. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its dispersal in suitable habitats.</p>
