                    <h1>Poa pseudosterilis</h1>
<p>Poa pseudosterilis, commonly known as the sterile bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences, though it is often sterile, meaning it does not produce viable seeds. Its botanical features make it a common weed in grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited seed production, it relies on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
