                    <h1>Phoradendron prolongatum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron prolongatum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or green flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its parasitic nature allows it to thrive in a variety of forest environments.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic habits, it plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by providing food for wildlife.</p>
