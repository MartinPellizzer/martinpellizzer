                    <h1>Phoradendron tubulosum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron tubulosum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. Its growth is facilitated by a specialized structure called a haustorium, which connects to the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Phoradendron tubulosum plays a significant role in ecological systems, supporting bird populations and contributing to forest biodiversity.</p>
