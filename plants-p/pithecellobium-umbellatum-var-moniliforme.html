                    <h1>Pithecellobium umbellatum var. moniliforme</h1>
<p>Pithecellobium umbellatum var. moniliforme, commonly known as the coral tree or monkeypod tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, drooping inflorescences that resemble coral, hence its common name. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its hard, heavy wood and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
