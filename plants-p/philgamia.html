                    <h1>Philgamia</h1>
<p>Philgamia, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and stems adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Philgamia produces small, yellow or orange berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in desert ecosystems.</p>
