                    <h1>Potamogeton × mariensis</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × mariensis, commonly known as the hybrid water milfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Potamogeton crispus and Potamogeton natans.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind or insects. Its rhizome system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it can also become invasive in certain regions, altering water quality and habitat structure.</p>
