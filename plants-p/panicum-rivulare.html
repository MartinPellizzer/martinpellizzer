                <h1>Panicum rivulare</h1>
<p>Panicum rivulare, commonly known as water panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist soils near rivers, streams, and marshes. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with narrow leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to golden flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in waterlogged areas.</p>
<p>Panicum rivulare plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
