<p>Paronychia aretioides var. nitens, commonly known as the silverleaf sandwort, is a low-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
