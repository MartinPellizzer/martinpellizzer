                    <h1>Prunus laurocerasus f. versaillensis</h1>
<p>Prunus laurocerasus f. versaillensis, commonly known as the Versailles laurel, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and emit a subtle, spicy fragrance. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by dark purple berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is valued for its dense foliage and ornamental appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>This variety is more compact than the typical Prunus laurocerasus, making it suitable for smaller spaces.</p>
