                    <h1>Pitcairnia unilateralis</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia unilateralis, commonly known as the single-leaf pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated rosette of dark green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence bearing vibrant orange or red flowers, which are typically showy and attract pollinators. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
