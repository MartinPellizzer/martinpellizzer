                    <h1>Parkinsonia glauca</h1>
<p>Parkinsonia glauca, commonly known as the blue paloverde, is a small evergreen tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, bluish-gray bark and small, leathery leaves that are typically shed during the dry season. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring and are followed by long, narrow pods containing flat, edible seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping and desert landscapes.</p>
<p>Parkinsonia glauca is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, improving soil fertility in degraded areas.</p>
