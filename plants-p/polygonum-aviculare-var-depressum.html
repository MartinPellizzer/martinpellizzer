                    <h1>Polygonum aviculare var. depressum</h1>
<p>Polygonum aviculare var. depressum, commonly known as the prostrate knotweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in wetland areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it an effective ground cover but also a potential weed in cultivated settings.</p>
