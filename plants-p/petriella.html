                    <h1>Petriella</h1>
<p>Petriella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, orchid-like flowers and its unique ability to thrive without soil, relying instead on specific host trees for nutrients. The plant's roots form a symbiotic relationship with fungi, enabling it to absorb water and minerals from the air and rain. Petriella typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in the canopy of hardwood forests.</p>
<p>Due to its fragility and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
