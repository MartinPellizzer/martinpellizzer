                    <h1>Phaca halicacaba</h1>
<p>Phaca halicacaba, commonly known as the rock saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting it to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Phaca halicacaba is often used in rehabilitation of degraded lands due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
