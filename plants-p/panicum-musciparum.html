<p>Panicum musciparum, commonly known as the mouse-ear or sticky mouse-ear, is a species of grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and small, spikelike inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds that are often coated in a sticky substance, aiding in seed adherence to animals or objects. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it thrives in dry, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Panicum musciparum is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
