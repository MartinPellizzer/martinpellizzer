                    <h1>Plantago patagonica var. limarensis</h1>
<p>Plantago patagonica var. limarensis, commonly known as the Patagonian plantain, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, typical of the Plantaginaceae family. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine meadows and steppe environments.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate regions.</p>
