<p>Poa annua subsp.</p>
<p>pilantha, commonly known as the coastal annual bluegrass, is a grass species native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, often blue-green leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes, coastal grasslands, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
