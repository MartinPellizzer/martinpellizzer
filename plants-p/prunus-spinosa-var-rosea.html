                    <h1>Prunus spinosa var. rosea</h1>
<p>Prunus spinosa var. rosea, commonly known as the pink flowering blackthorn, is a variant of the common blackthorn, characterized by its showy pink or white flowers.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia, typically growing in hedgerows and woodland edges. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. Its ornamental value comes from its early spring blossoms, which add a striking visual contrast to the thorny foliage.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green and oval-shaped, with a slightly serrated margin.</p>
