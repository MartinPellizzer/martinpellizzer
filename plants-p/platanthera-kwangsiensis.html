                    <h1>Platanthera kwangsiensis</h1>
<p>Platanthera kwangsiensis, commonly known as the Guangxi lady's tresses, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and a spike of pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil. It is closely related to other members of the Orchidaceae family, sharing similar floral structures and pollination mechanisms.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
