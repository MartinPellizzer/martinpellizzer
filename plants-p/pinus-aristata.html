<p>Pinus aristata, commonly known as the alpine fir, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, slow-growing form and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and its cones are small and often clustered. It produces both male and female cones, with the female cones developing into woody, persistent seed cones.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous terrain.</p>
