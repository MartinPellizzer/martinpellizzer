                    <h1>Pocockia glomerata</h1>
<p>Pocockia glomerata, commonly known as the clustered liverwort, is a small, leafy liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and the presence of small, overlapping leaves that form a tight rosette. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can retain moisture. Its reproductive structures, known as sorocarps, are borne on short, erect stalks and contain the plant's spores.</p>
<p>Pocockia glomerata is an important component of understory ecosystems, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
