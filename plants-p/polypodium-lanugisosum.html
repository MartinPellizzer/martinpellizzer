<p>Polypodium lanugisosum, commonly known as the woolly polypody, is a fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds covered in a fine, woolly layer of trichomes, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
