<p>Physacanthus talbotii, commonly known as the Talbot's ghost fern, is a unique fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research.</p>
