<p>Phacelophrynium longispica, commonly known as the long-spined arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often adorned with long, spiky projections. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in humid environments.</p>
