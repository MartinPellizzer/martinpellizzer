                    <h1>Pelea nealae</h1>
<p>Pelea nealae, commonly known as the Neal's pelea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Pelea nealae is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited geographic distribution.</p>
