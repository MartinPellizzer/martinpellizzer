<p>Phyllitis brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and ponds. The plant has finely divided, feathery fronds that help it absorb nutrients from the water. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, forming dense mats that provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Phyllitis brasiliensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
