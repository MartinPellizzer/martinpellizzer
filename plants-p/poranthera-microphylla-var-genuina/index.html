                            <h1>Poranthera Microphylla Var. Genuina</h1>
<p>Poranthera microphylla var. genuina is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is known for its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. This variety is a subspecies of Poranthera microphylla, which belongs to the Brassicaceae family, commonly known as the mustards. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts. Its unique beauty and ecological importance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
