<p>Phoradendron sonanum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and fleshy, sticky berries that are an important food source for various birds and animals. Its life cycle involves seeds that are dispersed by birds consuming the berries and then excreting the sticky seeds onto host trees.</p>
<p>Phoradendron sonanum plays a significant ecological role in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
