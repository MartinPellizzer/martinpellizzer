<p>Paepalanthus albovaginatus var. fuscobracteatus, commonly known as the white-barked papyrus, is a member of the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
