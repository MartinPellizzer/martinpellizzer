<p>Blue-eyed mary, scientifically known as Pycreus permutatus, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the western United States. It is named for its vibrant blue petals that resemble large, expressive eyes. This annual herb is commonly found in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny conditions. Its unique appearance has made it a popular choice for gardeners and botanists alike. Despite its beauty, it is also considered a weed in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread quickly.</p>
