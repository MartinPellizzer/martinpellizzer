                    <h1>Poa macedonica var. pseudovivipara</h1>
<p>Poa macedonica var. pseudovivipara, commonly known as the Macedonian meadow grass, is a variant of the meadow grass species native to the Balkan region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and somewhat hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its potential to exhibit vivipary, where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
