                    <h1>Pseudostenosiphonium viscosum var. microphyllum</h1>
<p>Pseudostenosiphonium viscosum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the sticky-stemmed microphyll fern, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its small, densely packed leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical or subtropical regions with high humidity. The plant's unique morphology includes a thick, sticky stem that helps it retain moisture and deter herbivores. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a waxy surface, which further aids in water conservation.</p>
<p>This variant is noted for its limited distribution and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to humid, low-light conditions.</p>
