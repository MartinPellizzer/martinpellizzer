                    <h1>Pinus sylvestris f. cornigera</h1>
<p>Pinus sylvestris f. cornigera, commonly known as the Scottish pine or mountain pine, is a naturally occurring variant of the Scots pine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to the typical Scots pine, often forming dense, shrub-like formations. The foliage is typically darker green and more densely packed, with shorter needles that give it a distinct appearance. It thrives in harsh, alpine or mountainous environments, showing high tolerance to cold and wind.</p>
<p>This form is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
