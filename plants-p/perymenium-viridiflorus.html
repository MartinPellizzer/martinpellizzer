                    <h1>Perymenium viridiflorus</h1>
<p>Perymenium viridiflorus, commonly known as the green-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees through its haustoria.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are a food source for various bird species. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid forest environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
