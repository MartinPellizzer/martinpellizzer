                    <h1>Poa subnudiflora</h1>
<p>Poa subnudiflora, commonly known as the naked-flowered bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to white flowers, which are less showy than those of other Poa species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
