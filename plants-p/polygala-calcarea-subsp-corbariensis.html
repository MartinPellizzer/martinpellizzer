<p>Polygala calcarea subsp.</p>
<p>corbariensis, commonly known as the Corbarien's milkvetch, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of southern France. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to cream.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in limestone-rich soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and gravelly plains. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
