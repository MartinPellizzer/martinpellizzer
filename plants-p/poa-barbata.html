                    <h1>Poa barbata</h1>
<p>Poa barbata, commonly known as the barbed bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, making it a common weed in lawns and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Poa barbata is adapted to a wide range of soil types but thrives in moist, well-drained conditions.</p>
