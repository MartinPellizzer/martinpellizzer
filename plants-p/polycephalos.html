                    <h1>Polycephalos</h1>
<p>Polycephalos, commonly known as the many-headed plant, is a unique species characterized by its unusual growth pattern.</p>
<p>It produces multiple heads or shoots from a single stem, giving it a distinctive, almost otherworldly appearance. Botanically, it belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley. The plant's foliage consists of finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures are small, clustered umbels, typical of its family, and it blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
