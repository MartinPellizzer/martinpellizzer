The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, round fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, red aril. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range.</p>
