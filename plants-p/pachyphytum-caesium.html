<p>Pachyphytum caesium, commonly known as the silver moon cactus, is a succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant features a rosette growth pattern with pale green to bluish-gray foliage. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>Pachyphytum caesium is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
