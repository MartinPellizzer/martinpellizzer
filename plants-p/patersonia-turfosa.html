                    <h1>Patersonia turfosa</h1>
<p>Patersonia turfosa, commonly known as the common patersonia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features dense, grass-like foliage that forms a carpet-like turf, often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Patersonia turfosa is valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shaded gardens and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
