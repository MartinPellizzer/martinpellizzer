                    <h1>Polycarpaea prostrata var. brevipes</h1>
<p>Polycarpaea prostrata var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed prostrate polycarpaea, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>It is typically found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, thriving in full sun conditions.</p>
