                    <h1>Potentilla × pseudocanescens</h1>
<p>Potentilla × pseudocanescens, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens.</p>
