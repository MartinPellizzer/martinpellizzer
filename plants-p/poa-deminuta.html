                    <h1>Poa deminuta</h1>
<p>Poa deminuta, commonly known as the dwarf mountain grass, is a small, low-growing grass species native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, cushion-like mats to withstand harsh environmental conditions such as cold temperatures and strong winds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are often concealed within the foliage. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or barren habitats.</p>
<p>Poa deminuta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other alpine flora and fauna.</p>
