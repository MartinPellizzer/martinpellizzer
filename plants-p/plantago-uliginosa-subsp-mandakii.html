<p>Plantago uliginosa subsp.</p>
<p>mandakii, commonly known as the marsh plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and prominent veins.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
