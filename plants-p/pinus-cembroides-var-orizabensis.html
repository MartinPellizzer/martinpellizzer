                    <h1>Pinus cembroides var. orizabensis</h1>
<p>Pinus cembroides var. orizabensis, commonly known as the Orizaba pine, is a rare and endemic species native to central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a medium to tall evergreen conifer characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The tree typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in mountainous regions. Its cones are serotinous, meaning they remain closed until triggered by heat, such as from a forest fire, to release seeds.</p>
<p>This adaptation aids in its reproduction in harsh, fire-prone environments.</p>
