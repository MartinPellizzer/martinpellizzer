<p>Polypleurum elongatum, commonly known as the longleaf polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and can spread to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in distinct rows.</p>
