                    <h1>Phyllodoce nipponica</h1>
<p>Phyllodoce nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in its cool, moist habitat. It produces tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring, followed by red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful.</p>
<p>Phyllodoce nipponica is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
