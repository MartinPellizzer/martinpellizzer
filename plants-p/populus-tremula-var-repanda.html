                    <h1>Populus tremula var. repanda</h1>
<p>Populus tremula var. repanda, commonly known as the trembling aspen or European aspen, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed leaves that tremble in the wind, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often found in forest stands.</p>
