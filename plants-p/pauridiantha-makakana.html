<p>Pauridiantha makakana, commonly known as the Kauai mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the island of Kauai in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rock faces or in forest understories. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying Hawaiian flora.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this vulnerable species from habitat loss and invasive species.</p>
