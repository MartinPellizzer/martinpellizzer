                    <h1>Picea alcoquiana var. reflexa</h1>
<p>Picea alcoquiana var. reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed spruce, is a variant of the alcoquiana spruce, characterized by its distinctive downward-curving needles.</p>
<p>This evergreen conifer is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. Its foliage is dense and dark green, with a silvery-white underside that gives it a striking appearance. The tree typically grows in cool, moist environments and is adapted to harsh mountainous conditions.</p>
<p>It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems.</p>
