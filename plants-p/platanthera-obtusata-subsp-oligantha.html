<p>Platanthera obtusata subsp.</p>
<p>oligantha, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense inflorescence of pale green to white flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine forests and wetlands. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is crucial for its survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
