                    <h1>Paronychia arabica var. cossoniana</h1>
<p>Paronychia arabica var. cossoniana, commonly known as the Cosson's sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscapes.</p>
