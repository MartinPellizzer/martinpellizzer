<p>Potentilla theodoriana subsp.</p>
<p>opizii, commonly known as the Opiz's cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging conditions.</p>
<p>The subspecies opizii is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of P. theodoriana.</p>
