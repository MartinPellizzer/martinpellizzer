<p>Paspalum comosum, commonly known as the hairy paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which allows it to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Paspalum comosum is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, where it can form dense mats.</p>
