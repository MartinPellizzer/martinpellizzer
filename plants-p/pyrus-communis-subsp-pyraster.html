<p>Pyrus communis subsp.</p>
<p>pyraster, commonly known as the common medlar, is a subspecies of the common pear that is native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its rough, fissured bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The fruit, which ripens in autumn, is typically a hard, astringent berry that requires a process called "bletting" to soften and develop its characteristic flavor. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Rosaceae family.</p>
