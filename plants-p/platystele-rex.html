<p>Platystele rex, commonly known as the royal platystele, is a rare and endangered epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in high humidity and partial shade, often growing on tree trunks or branches in the canopy. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
