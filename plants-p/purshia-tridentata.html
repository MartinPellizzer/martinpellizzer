<p>Purshia tridentata, commonly known as antelope bitterbrush, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow flowers and gray-green foliage, which are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and it produces small, clustered flowers in the spring.</p>
<p>Purshia tridentata plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects.</p>
