                    <h1>Phalaris coerulescens</h1>
<p>Phalaris coerulescens, commonly known as blue grass or blue oat grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and the soft blue hue of its inflorescence.</p>
<p>Phalaris coerulescens is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
