<p>Pleiotaxis huillensis subsp.</p>
<p>argentea, commonly known as the silver pleiotaxis, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
