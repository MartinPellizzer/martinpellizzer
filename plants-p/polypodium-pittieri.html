<p>Polypodium pittieri, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>Polypodium pittieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
