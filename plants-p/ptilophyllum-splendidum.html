<p>Ptilophyllum splendidum, commonly known as the splendid featherplant, is a species of aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant typically grows in slow-moving or still waters, such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself in muddy or sandy substrates. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually submerged, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in aquariums and wetland restoration projects.</p>
