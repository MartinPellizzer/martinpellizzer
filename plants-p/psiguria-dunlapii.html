<p>Psiguria dunlapii, commonly known as the Dunlap's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, wetland environments. It has a unique root system that forms symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, Psiguria dunlapii is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
