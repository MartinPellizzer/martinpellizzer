<p>Polypodium connectile, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 15â€“30 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across forest floors. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium.</p>
<p>Polypodium connectile thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, acidic soil.</p>
