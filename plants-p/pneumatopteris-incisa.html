                    <h1>Pneumatopteris incisa</h1>
<p>Pneumatopteris incisa, commonly known as the cut-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bright green and can develop a waxy coating to reduce water loss in shallow waters.</p>
