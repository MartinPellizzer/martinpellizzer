<p>Pteroceras viridiflorum, commonly known as the greenflower tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought.</p>
<p>Pteroceras viridiflorum plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion in its native habitat.</p>
