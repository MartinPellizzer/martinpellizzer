<p>Priestleya meyeri, commonly known as the Meyer's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow, strap-like, and often clustered at the base, while its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered an endangered species, making it a subject of conservation interest.</p>
