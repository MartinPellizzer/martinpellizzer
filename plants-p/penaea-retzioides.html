                    <h1>Penaea retzioides</h1>
<p>Penaea retzioides, commonly known as the swamp bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called pneumatocysts, which help it float and facilitate gas exchange. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow. It is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family, known for its carnivorous tendencies in some species.</p>
<p>Penaea retzioides is primarily a non-carnivorous plant but plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
