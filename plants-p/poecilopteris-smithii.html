                    <h1>Poecilopteris smithii</h1>
<p>Poecilopteris smithii, commonly known as the Smith's cliff fern, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feather-like fronds and is often found in fossil records from the Late Cretaceous period. The plant exhibits a complex vascular system, typical of advanced ferns, which allowed it to thrive in moist, tropical environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in distinct patterns on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Poecilopteris smithii provides important insights into the evolution of early seed plants and the paleobotanical history of ancient ecosystems.</p>
