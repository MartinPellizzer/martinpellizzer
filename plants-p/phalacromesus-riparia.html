<p>Phalacromesus riparia, commonly known as the riverbank phalaris, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and riverine habitats.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow waters and moist soils, exhibiting rhizomatous growth that allows it to spread along the edges of water bodies. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are usually greenish or reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often floating or semi-submerged depending on water levels.</p>
<p>Phalacromesus riparia plays an important role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
