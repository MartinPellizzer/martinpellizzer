<p>Pleuropogon hooverianus, commonly known as the Hoover's Panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the Panicum genus. It is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions.</p>
