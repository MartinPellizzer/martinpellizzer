<p>Pteris gaudichaudii, commonly known as the Gaudichaud's water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Pteris gaudichaudii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant.</p>
