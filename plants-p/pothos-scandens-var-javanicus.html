                    <h1>Pothos scandens var. javanicus</h1>
<p>Pothos scandens var. javanicus, commonly known as the climbing pothos, is a vigorous vine native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a slightly variegated pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by yellowish berries, though these are rarely seen in cultivation. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and air-purifying qualities make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
