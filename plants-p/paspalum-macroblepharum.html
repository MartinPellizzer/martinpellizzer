<p>Paspalum macroblepharum, commonly known as the large-eyed grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
