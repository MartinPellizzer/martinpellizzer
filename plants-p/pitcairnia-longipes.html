<p>Pitcairnia longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and large, showy inflorescences that can reach several feet in height. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves forms a central cup that collects rainwater, providing a microhabitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia longipes is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in shaded, humid environments.</p>
