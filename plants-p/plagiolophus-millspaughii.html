                    <h1>Plagiolophus millspaughii</h1>
<p>Plagiolophus millspaughii, commonly known as the Millspaugh's false hellebore, is a rare and striking member of the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves that are often speckled with white or yellow spots. The plant produces an unusual inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
