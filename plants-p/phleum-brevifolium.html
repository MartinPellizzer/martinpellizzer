<p>Phleum brevifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves that are typically shorter and narrower than those of other fescue species. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Phleum brevifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects.</p>
