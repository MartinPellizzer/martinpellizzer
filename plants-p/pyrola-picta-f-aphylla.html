                    <h1>Pyrola picta f. aphylla</h1>
<p>Pyrola picta f. aphylla, commonly known as the leafless pink wintergreen, is a rare and striking variant of the Pyrola picta species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its absence of leaves, with only small, scale-like structures present instead. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in coniferous forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study.</p>
