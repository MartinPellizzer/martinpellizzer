<p>Placostigma, commonly known as the "glassy moss," is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Metzgeriaceae.</p>
<p>These small, cryptogamic plants are characterized by their unique structure, featuring a central stalk with a cup-like structure called a placostigma at the top. They are typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or tree trunks. Placostigma species are notable for their ability to survive in extreme conditions, including desiccation and freezing.</p>
<p>Their ecological role includes contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
