                    <h1>Pteris kinabaluensis</h1>
<p>Pteris kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu water fern, is a species of fern native to Borneo, specifically found in the mountainous regions of Sabah.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically borne on long, slender stalks. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
<p>This fern is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
