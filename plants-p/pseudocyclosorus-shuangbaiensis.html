<p>Pseudocyclosorus shuangbaiensis, commonly known as the Shuangbai water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically four-lobed. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, with spores produced in specialized organs called sporocarps.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
