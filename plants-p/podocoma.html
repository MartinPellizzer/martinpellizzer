                    <h1>Podocoma</h1>
<p>Podocoma, commonly known as the desert holly, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their succulent leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, white, and pink. Podocoma species are typically low-growing shrubs with a compact, bushy form, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Their fleshy stems and leaves store water, allowing them to thrive in conditions with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in drought-prone areas.</p>
