<p>Polystichum seemannii, commonly known as the emerald fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that form a compact, upright clump. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, thick rhizomes that help anchor it in rocky or shaded soils. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of pinnae, giving it a finely divided, lacy appearance.</p>
<p>Polystichum seemannii thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories where it receives dappled sunlight.</p>
