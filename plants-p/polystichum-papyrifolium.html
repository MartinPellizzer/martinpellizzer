                    <h1>Polystichum papyrifolium</h1>
<p>Polystichum papyrifolium, commonly known as the paper-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that are often covered in a fine, silky texture. The fronds are typically light green to dark green, with a distinctive papery sheen that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in rows along the veins.</p>
