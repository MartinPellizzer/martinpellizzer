                    <h1>Phalaris intermedia f. platensis</h1>
<p>Phalaris intermedia f. platensis, commonly known as the flat-leaved glassworts, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding survival in arid or coastal conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in high-salinity soils makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
