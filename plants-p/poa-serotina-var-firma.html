<p>Poa serotina var. firma, commonly known as the firm tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically clustered at the base of the foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
