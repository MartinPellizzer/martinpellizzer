                    <h1>Piptochaetium collinum</h1>
<p>Piptochaetium collinum, commonly known as the coastal grass or dwarf coastal grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is also used in restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
