                    <h1>Poa vaginalis</h1>
<p>Poa vaginalis, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, Poa vaginalis is both a common weed and a valuable forage plant.</p>
