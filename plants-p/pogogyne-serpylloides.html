<p>Pogogyne serpylloides, commonly known as the slender bog grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, ribbon-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flower spikes that are typically greenish or reddish in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific habitats, it is often found in association with other wetland plants such as sedges and rushes.</p>
