                    <h1>Phthirusa exilis</h1>
<p>Phthirusa exilis, commonly known as the slender leafy liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, flat, and leaf-like structures that are typically arranged in a rosette or ribbon-like pattern. This liverwort thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophytes, are concealed beneath the leafy layers, contributing to its cryptic appearance.</p>
<p>Phthirusa exilis plays a minor but ecologically significant role in nutrient cycling in its habitat.</p>
