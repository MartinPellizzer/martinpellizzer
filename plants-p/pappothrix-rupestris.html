                    <h1>Pappothrix rupestris</h1>
<p>Pappothrix rupestris, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in rocky, arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, enabling it to survive in nutrient-poor substrates. It is often found on limestone and granite surfaces, where it plays a role in weathering and soil formation.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
