<p>Premna limbata, commonly known as the silky tree or velvet leaf, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, followed by small, fleshy, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
