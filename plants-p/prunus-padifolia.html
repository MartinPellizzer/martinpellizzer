                    <h1>Prunus padifolia</h1>
<p>Prunus padifolia, commonly known as the rock almond or desert almond, is a small shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, thick, waxy leaves, and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, hard, almond-like fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. Prunus padifolia is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a slow growth rate that allows it to survive in harsh environments.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
