<p>Polypodium glabrum, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to various regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its rhizome is thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself firmly in rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Polypodium glabrum reproduces via spores, which are released from the sporangia located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
