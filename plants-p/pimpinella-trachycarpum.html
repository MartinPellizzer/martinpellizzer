<p>Pimpinella trachycarpum, commonly known as the roughcarp beetle plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in rocky or calcareous soils. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its seeds are enclosed in small, rough-hairy fruits, giving it its scientific name.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is not widely cultivated due to its specific habitat requirements.</p>
