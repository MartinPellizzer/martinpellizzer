<p>Phragmites americanus, commonly known as common reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It has long, slender leaves and produces dense clusters of brown, feathery flowers. This plant is highly invasive and can dominate wetland ecosystems, often outcompeting native species. Its rhizomes spread rapidly, forming extensive underground networks that help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Phragmites americanus plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
