                    <h1>Phyllanthus arenarius var. arenarius</h1>
<p>Phyllanthus arenarius var. arenarius, commonly known as the sand pear, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, spiny leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are typically small and clustered, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for both humans and animals. Its root system is deep and extensive, enabling it to access moisture from underground sources.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant.</p>
