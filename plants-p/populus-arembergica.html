The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range.</p>
