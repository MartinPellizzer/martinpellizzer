                    <h1>Pitavia</h1>
<p>Pitavia, commonly known as the pitahaya or dragon fruit, is a tropical cactus belonging to the genus Hylocereus.</p>
<p>It is native to Central and South America and is characterized by its thick, spiny stems and vibrant, colorful flowers. The plant produces a fruit with a thick, leathery skin that can be pink, yellow, or red, and a white or yellow pulp dotted with small, edible seeds. Pitavia thrives in warm, arid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its cultivation is popular for both ornamental and culinary purposes due to its unique appearance and nutritional value.</p>
