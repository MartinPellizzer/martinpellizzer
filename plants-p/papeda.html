<p>Papeda, commonly known as the "ghost bean," is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its long, slender stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Papeda is often cultivated for its nutrient-rich seeds, which are high in protein and used in local cuisines.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid climates make it a valuable plant in agroforestry systems.</p>
