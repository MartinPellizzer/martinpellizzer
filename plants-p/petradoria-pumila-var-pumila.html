                    <h1>Petradoria pumila var. pumila</h1>
<p>Petradoria pumila var. pumila, commonly known as the rock holly, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in xeric environments such as limestone outcrops.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in ecological studies of drought-tolerant flora.</p>
