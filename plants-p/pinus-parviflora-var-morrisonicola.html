                    <h1>Pinus parviflora var. morrisonicola</h1>
<p>Pinus parviflora var. morrisonicola, commonly known as the Morrison Island pine, is a rare and endemic variant of the Japanese white pine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are shorter and more clustered than those of the typical Pinus parviflora. The cones are small and often remain closed for extended periods, a trait that helps protect the seeds from environmental stress. This variety thrives in specific microclimates, typically on rocky soils in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
