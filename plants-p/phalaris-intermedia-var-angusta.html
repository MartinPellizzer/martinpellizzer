                    <h1>Phalaris intermedia var. angusta</h1>
<p>Phalaris intermedia var. angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf wild oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of spikelets that are often tinged with purple or red. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands.</p>
<p>This plant is often considered an indicator species for wetland environments due to its specific habitat requirements.</p>
