<p>Platanthera takedae subsp.</p>
<p>takedae, commonly known as the Takeda's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a spiral pattern.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and grasslands. It has specialized root structures that allow it to absorb nutrients from the mycorrhizal fungi associated with its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
