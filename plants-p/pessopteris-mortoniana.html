<p>Pessopteris mortoniana, commonly known as the Morton's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that help it spread across the water's surface. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a distinctive appearance that resembles the shape of a water lily.</p>
<p>Pessopteris mortoniana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality through its natural filtration properties.</p>
