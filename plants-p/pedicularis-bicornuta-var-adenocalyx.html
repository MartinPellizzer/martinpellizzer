<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that resemble small monkeys.

Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive two-horned structure on the labellum.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized gardens due to its rarity and beauty.</p>
