<p>Pernettya pentlandii subvar. humilis, commonly known as the lowland cowberry, is a dwarf shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with stems that often lie prostrate on the ground. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible, red berries similar to blueberries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
