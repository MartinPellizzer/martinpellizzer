<p>Panicum eriochrysoides, commonly known as hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form dense mats, often in wet or seasonally flooded soils.</p>
<p>Panicum eriochrysoides is typically found in marshes, swamps, and other moist habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife.</p>
