                    <h1>Perymenium harlingii</h1>
<p>Perymenium harlingii, commonly known as the Harling's perymenium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in umbels. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodlands or stream banks, where it can receive adequate moisture and partial sunlight. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Perymenium harlingii is considered a botanically interesting but endangered species.</p>
