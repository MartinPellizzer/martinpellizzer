                    <h1>Polypodium foetidum</h1>
<p>Polypodium foetidum, commonly known as the stink fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of whiteèŒ¸. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The plant's name derives from its slightly unpleasant odor, which is more noticeable when the fronds are crushed.</p>
