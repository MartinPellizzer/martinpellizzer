                    <h1>Parasenegalia visco</h1>
<p>Parasenegalia visco, commonly known as the sticky parasenegal, is a shrub native to the semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>The sticky resin has been used traditionally by local communities for various purposes, including as a natural adhesive.</p>
