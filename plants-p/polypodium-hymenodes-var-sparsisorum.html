                    <h1>Polypodium hymenodes var. sparsisorum</h1>
<p>Polypodium hymenodes var. sparsisorum, commonly known as the sparse-veined wall fern, is a variant of the polypody fern characterized by its slender, erect fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The fronds are pinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens.</p>
