<p>Pteris vittata subsp.</p>
<p>vermae, commonly known as the Indian brake fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often bright green with a distinct midrib.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
