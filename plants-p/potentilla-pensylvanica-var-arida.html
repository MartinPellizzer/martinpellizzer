                    <h1>Potentilla pensylvanica var. arida</h1>
<p>Potentilla pensylvanica var. arida, commonly known as sandstone cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor, sandy soils. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy ornamental plant for xeriscapes.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
