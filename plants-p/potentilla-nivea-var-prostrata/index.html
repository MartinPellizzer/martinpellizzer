                            <h1>Potentilla Nivea Var. Prostrata</h1>
<p>Snowy cinquefoil, scientifically known as Potentilla nivea var. prostrata, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in harsh environments, including tundra and rocky slopes, where few other plants can survive. The plant is characterized by its white flowers and silver-green leaves, which help it reflect sunlight and retain heat. Its ability to withstand extreme cold makes it an important component of polar ecosystems. Despite its delicate appearance, Snowy cinquefoil plays a vital role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
