                    <h1>Psoralea exigua</h1>
<p>Psoralea exigua, commonly known as the slender psoralea, is a small annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 centimeters and has slender, branching stems covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are usually narrow and opposite, with a hairy surface that aids in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Psoralea exigua is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments, making it a characteristic species of xerophytic vegetation.</p>
