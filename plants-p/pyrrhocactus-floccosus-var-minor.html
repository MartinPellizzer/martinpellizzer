<p>Pyrrhocactus floccosus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser fluff cactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to specific regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, fleshy stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by spherical, red fruits. It thrives in arid environments with well-draining soil and requires minimal water to survive.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
