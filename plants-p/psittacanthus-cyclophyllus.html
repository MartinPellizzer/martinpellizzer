                    <h1>Psittacanthus cyclophyllus</h1>
<p>Psittacanthus cyclophyllus, commonly known as the cyclophyllus cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones rather than flowers. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk with a smooth, fibrous bark and pinnately compound leaves that are feather-like in appearance. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests or on rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
