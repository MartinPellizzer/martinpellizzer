<p>Pernettya myrsinites, commonly known as the waxleaf cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It features dense, rounded clusters of small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a whitish waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces tiny, red berries that are edible and often consumed by birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold climates with long winters.</p>
<p>Pernettya myrsinites plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
