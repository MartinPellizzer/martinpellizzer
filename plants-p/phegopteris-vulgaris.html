                    <h1>Phegopteris vulgaris</h1>
<p>Phegopteris vulgaris, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize aquatic sediments.</p>
<p>Phegopteris vulgaris plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling.</p>
