<p>Plectrachne caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains of rice-like seeds. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet environments, it is often found in areas with seasonal flooding.</p>
