                    <h1>Pinus edulis</h1>
<p>Pinus edulis, commonly known as the ponderosa pine, is a tall evergreen conifer native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, needle-like leaves that grow in bundles of two, and its thick, scaly bark that provides protection against forest fires. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>This species plays a vital role in the ecosystems of its native range, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
