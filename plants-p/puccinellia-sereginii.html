                    <h1>Puccinellia sereginii</h1>
<p>Puccinellia sereginii, commonly known as the Mongolian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil, making it an important component of steppe and desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ecological significance lies in its role as forage for livestock and its contribution to soil stabilization in fragile environments.</p>
