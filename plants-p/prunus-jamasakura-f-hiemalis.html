                    <h1>Prunus jamasakura f. hiemalis</h1>
<p>Prunus jamasakura f. hiemalis, commonly known as the winter cherry, is a unique floral variant of the Japanese cherry tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its early blooming habit, producing pink flowers in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant is a compact shrub with a dense, rounded form, making it suitable for small gardens or container planting. Its flowers are highly fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The botanical features include small, ovate leaves and a relatively short lifespan, typically lasting a few years before the plant declines.</p>
