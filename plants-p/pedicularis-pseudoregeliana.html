<p>Pedicularis pseudoregeliana, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble small monkeys, hence its common name. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
