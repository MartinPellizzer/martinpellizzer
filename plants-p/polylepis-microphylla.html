                    <h1>Polylepis microphylla</h1>
<p>Polylepis microphylla, commonly known as the Andean wax tree, is a unique evergreen tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and distinctive, waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The tree produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting various pollinators. Polylepis microphylla is often found in cloud forests and p√°ramo ecosystems, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is also considered an endangered species.</p>
