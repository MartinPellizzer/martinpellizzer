                    <h1>Polygonum hygrogenes</h1>
<p>Polygonum hygrogenes, commonly known as the water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in shallow water or moist soil.</p>
<p>Polygonum hygrogenes is valued for its ability to stabilize shorelines and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
