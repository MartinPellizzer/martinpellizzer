                    <h1>Psammisia symphystemona</h1>
<p>Psammisia symphystemona, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in hot, dry environments. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss, and it produces small, yellow, dandelion-like flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, similar to the common dandelion, and it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
<p>Psammisia symphystemona is adapted to survive in extreme conditions with minimal water availability.</p>
