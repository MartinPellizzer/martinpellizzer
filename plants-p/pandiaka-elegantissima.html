<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the top of the stem.

<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
