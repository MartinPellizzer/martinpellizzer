<p>Polypodium lagunense, commonly known as the Lake fern, is a tropical fern native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically bright green and covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along stream banks or in humid forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium lagunense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
