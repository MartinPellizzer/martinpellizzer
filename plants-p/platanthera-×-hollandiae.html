                    <h1>Platanthera × hollandiae</h1>
<p>Platanthera × hollandiae, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Platanthera falcata and Platanthera chlorophaea, characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tall, slender flower spikes. The flowers are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that aids in pollination by specific insects. This orchid thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs and fens.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
