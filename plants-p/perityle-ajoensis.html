<p>Perityle ajoensis, commonly known as the Ajo sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Perityle ajoensis plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
