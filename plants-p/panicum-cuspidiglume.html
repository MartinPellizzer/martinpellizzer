<p>Panicum cuspidiglume, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Panicum cuspidiglume is often found in open fields, disturbed soils, and along roadsides.</p>
