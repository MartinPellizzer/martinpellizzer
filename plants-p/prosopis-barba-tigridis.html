<p>Prosopis barba-tigridis, commonly known as the Mexican mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often reduced to spines in harsh environments, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain edible seeds, which have been used by indigenous peoples for food and other purposes.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky soils, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
