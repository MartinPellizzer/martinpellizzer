                    <h1>Pediocactus wrightiae</h1>
<p>Pediocactus wrightiae, commonly known as Wright's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular shape and dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>Pediocactus wrightiae is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
