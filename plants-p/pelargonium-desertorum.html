<p>Pelargonium desertorum, commonly known as the desert geranium, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Pelargonium desertorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements in drought-prone environments.</p>
