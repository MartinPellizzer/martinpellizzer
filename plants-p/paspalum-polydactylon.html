                    <h1>Paspalum polydactylon</h1>
<p>Paspalum polydactylon, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Paspalum polydactylon is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
