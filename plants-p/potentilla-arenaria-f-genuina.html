                    <h1>Potentilla arenaria f. genuina</h1>
<p>Potentilla arenaria f. genuina, commonly known as the sand potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
