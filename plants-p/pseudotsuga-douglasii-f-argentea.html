                    <h1>Pseudotsuga douglasii f. argentea</h1>
<p>Pseudotsuga douglasii f. argentea, commonly known as the silver Douglas fir, is a unique variant of the Douglas fir characterized by its striking silvery-white bark and foliage.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a more open, irregular growth habit compared to the typical conical shape of the species. Its leaves are shorter and more densely packed, giving the tree a distinctive, almost feathery appearance. The silver hue of its bark is due to a unique layer of flaky, papery material that peels away over time.</p>
<p>This form is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
