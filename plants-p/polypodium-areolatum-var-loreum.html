<p>Polypodium areolatum var. loreum, commonly known as the Loreum wall-ruffle fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a distinctive, granular texture, and the sporangia are clustered in small, round structures called areolae.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions.</p>
