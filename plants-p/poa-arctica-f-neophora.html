<p>Poa arctica f. neophora, commonly known as the Arctic bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. This plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Poa arctica f. neophora plays a vital ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for arctic flora and fauna.</p>
