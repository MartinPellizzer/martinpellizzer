                    <h1>Pterinodes</h1>
<p>Pterinodes, commonly known as false heather, are small, evergreen shrubs native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>They belong to the Ericaceae family and are characterized by their compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in spring. Pterinodes thrive in well-drained, acidic soils and require full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to their ornamental value and unique appearance, they are often cultivated in gardens and rockeries.</p>
