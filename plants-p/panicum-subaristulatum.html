<p>Panicum subaristulatum, commonly known as the narrow-awn panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with bristly awns, which are specialized structures that aid in seed dispersal. It typically thrives in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in agricultural and natural areas.</p>
