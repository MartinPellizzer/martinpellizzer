<p>Phyllorkis bufo, commonly known as the golden-backed tree frog, is a species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive golden dorsal markings and a slender, arboreal body adapted for life in trees. The plant-like appearance of its skin and the way it clings to foliage can sometimes lead to confusion with certain flowering plants. Its habitat includes humid rainforests, where it relies on moisture-rich environments for survival.</p>
<p>The frog plays a role in local ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for various predators.</p>
