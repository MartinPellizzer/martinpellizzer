<p>Peniocereus fosterianus, commonly known as the Foster's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spineless plant with a compact, rounded body that often forms a dense mat. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers at night, which open briefly and emit a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Its leaves are modified into thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The flowers typically bloom in late spring or early summer, making it a notable plant for desert gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
