                    <h1>Pseudocalymma standleyi</h1>
<p>Pseudocalymma standleyi, commonly known as the red-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with small, pale green leaves and showy, red or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It is a terrestrial orchid that forms a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Pseudocalymma standleyi is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
