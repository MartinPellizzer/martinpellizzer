<p>Picramnia martiniana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, red or orange berries. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in the making of musical instruments and furniture.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in its natural habitat.</p>
