<p>Polygala dodii, commonly known as the Dodii's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a distinctive spurred structure that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
