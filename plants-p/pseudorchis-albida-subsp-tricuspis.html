<p>Pseudorchis albida subsp.</p>
<p>tricuspis, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
