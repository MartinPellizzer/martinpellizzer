                    <h1>Packera heterophylla</h1>
<p>Packera heterophylla, commonly known as the alpine aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, which change with altitude and environmental conditions, a trait known as heterophylly. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Packera heterophylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native range.</p>
