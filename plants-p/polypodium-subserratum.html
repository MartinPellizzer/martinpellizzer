                    <h1>Polypodium subserratum</h1>
<p>Polypodium subserratum, commonly known as the serrated holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a structure typical of ferns. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.</p>
