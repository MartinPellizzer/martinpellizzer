<p>Polypodium pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf wall fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant has finely divided, delicate fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its rhizome is short and produces both roots and spore-producing structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Polypodium pumilio is well adapted to humid climates and is often found in forest understories or on shaded rock faces.</p>
