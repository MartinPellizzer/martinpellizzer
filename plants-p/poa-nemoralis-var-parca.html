                    <h1>Poa nemoralis var. parca</h1>
<p>Poa nemoralis var. parca, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stem. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed sites.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in association with other woodland flora, playing a role in soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
