                    <h1>Phoradendron orbiculatum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron orbiculatum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are often used in holiday decorations. Its parasitic nature makes it both a subject of ecological study and a symbol in various cultures.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic lifestyle, it plays a role in supporting bird populations that feed on its berries.</p>
