                    <h1>Phaca encenadae</h1>
<p>Phaca encenadae, commonly known as the smoky phaca, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with small, leathery leaves that have a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that emit a faint, almost incense-like aroma, giving it its common name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phaca encenadae is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
