                    <h1>Puccinellia atacamensis</h1>
<p>Puccinellia atacamensis, commonly known as Atacama grass, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America, particularly the Atacama Desert.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass species that thrives in extremely dry and saline environments, showcasing remarkable adaptations to harsh conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes cultivated for use in restoration projects in arid landscapes.</p>
