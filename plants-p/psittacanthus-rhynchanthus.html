                    <h1>Psittacanthus rhynchanthus</h1>
<p>Psittacanthus rhynchanthus, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its striking, bright yellow to golden-green fronds that resemble stars. The plant typically thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Psittacanthus rhynchanthus make it a popular choice for both ornamental aquatic gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
