<p>Pinus strobiformis subsp.</p>
<p>veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's white pine, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the mountainous regions of southern California. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its distinctive, soft, white needles that are typically two to three inches long.</p>
<p>The cones of this subspecies are relatively small, with short, sharp bracts that give them a unique appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
