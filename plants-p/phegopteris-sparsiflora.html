<p>Phegopteris sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has a delicate, floating frond structure with a central vein and small, sparsely distributed pinnae. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
