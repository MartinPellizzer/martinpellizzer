<p>Pritchardia flynnii, commonly known as the Hawaiian silver palm, is a species of cycad native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach lengths of up to 6 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal areas and lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural propagation, Pritchardia flynnii is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws.</p>
