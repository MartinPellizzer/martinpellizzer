<p>Pilosocereus gounellei var. zehntneri, commonly known as the Zehntner's Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the night, which attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in xerophytic gardens.</p>
