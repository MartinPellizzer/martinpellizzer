                    <h1>Poa californica</h1>
<p>Poa californica, commonly known as California bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It features fine, blue-green blades that form dense, low-growing turf, often used in landscaping for its ornamental appeal. The plant has slender, fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Its flowering spikes produce small, inconspicuous greenish-brown flowers, which are followed by seed heads that disperse easily in the wind.</p>
