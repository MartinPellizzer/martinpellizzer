                    <h1>Paulownia glabrata</h1>
<p>Paulownia glabrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf paulownia, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often fuzzy to the touch. The tree produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are typically purple or pink in color. Its rapid growth rate and lightweight wood make it a popular choice for ornamental planting and timber.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
