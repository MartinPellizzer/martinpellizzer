<p>Phacelia gymnoclada, commonly known as the desert blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Phacelia gymnoclada is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
