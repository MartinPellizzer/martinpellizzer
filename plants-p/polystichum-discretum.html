                    <h1>Polystichum discretum</h1>
<p>Polystichum discretum, commonly known as the discrete shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its finely divided, dark green fronds that form a dense, shield-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomes are wiry and produce clusters of fertile fronds with spore-bearing structures called sori.</p>
<p>Polystichum discretum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings.</p>
