                    <h1>Ptisana</h1>
<p>Ptisana, commonly known as the "flower of the sea," is a unique plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters along its stems. The plant thrives in saline environments, often growing on rocky shores or in coastal dunes. Ptisana has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to harsh coastal conditions and its role in coastal ecosystems.</p>
