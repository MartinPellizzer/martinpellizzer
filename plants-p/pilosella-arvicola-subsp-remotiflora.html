<p>Pilosella arvicola subsp.</p>
<p>remotiflora, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Siberia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, woolly gray-green foliage that helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions.</p>
