                    <h1>Puya parviflora</h1>
<p>Puya parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered puya, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of broad, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces an inflorescence of small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, humid conditions and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens.</p>
