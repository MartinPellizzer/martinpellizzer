<p>Psychotria tetragonoides, commonly known as the "Bushman's poison" or "arrow poison plant," is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves with a distinctive quadrangular shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of alkaloids, particularly tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which contributes to its toxic properties.</p>
<p>Psychotria tetragonoides is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests.</p>
