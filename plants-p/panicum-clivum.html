                    <h1>Panicum clivum</h1>
<p>Panicum clivum, commonly known as the cliff panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It is well adapted to rocky or disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and low water requirements, it is often used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
