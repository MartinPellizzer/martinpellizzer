                    <h1>Physondra</h1>
<p>Physondra, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, shaded environments. They are characterized by their orchid-like flowers, which often have a greenish or brownish hue with intricate patterns. Physondra species are notable for their ability to grow in nutrient-poor soils, often relying on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, each with slight variations in leaf structure and flowering time.</p>
