                    <h1>Pinus nobilis f. glauca</h1>
<p>Pinus nobilis f. glauca, commonly known as the bluish fir or blue pine, is a rare variant of the Aleppo pine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive blue-gray foliage, which results from a dense layer of epicuticular wax on the needle surfaces. This feature gives it a striking appearance and sets it apart from other pine species. The plant is native to the eastern Mediterranean region and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a botanical curiosity and of interest in horticultural collections.</p>
