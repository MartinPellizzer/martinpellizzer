<p>Pteris ceilanica, commonly known as the Ceylon water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water sources such as streams and marshes. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>The plant's intricate morphology makes it a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticultural cultivation.</p>
