                    <h1>Pityrogramma viscosa</h1>
<p>Pityrogramma viscosa, commonly known as the sticky stegium, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered with a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous leaves, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters, facilitating its reproduction in suitable habitats.</p>
