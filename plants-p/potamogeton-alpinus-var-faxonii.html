<p>Potamogeton alpinus var. faxonii, commonly known as the alpine pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to cold, temperate regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in freshwater lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams, often in shallow waters with soft sediment. The plant has long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the Potamogetonaceae family.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to low-nutrient environments and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and fish.</p>
