                    <h1>Poa delicatula</h1>
<p>Poa delicatula, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its slender, slightly hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
