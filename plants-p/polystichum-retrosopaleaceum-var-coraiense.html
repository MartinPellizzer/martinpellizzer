                    <h1>Polystichum retrosopaleaceum var. coraiense</h1>
<p>Polystichum retrosopaleaceum var. coraiense, commonly known as the Coraiense shield fern, is a rare and endemic species found in specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
