<p>Phagnalon saxatile proles lagascae, commonly known as the Lagasce rock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and can often be found on limestone or gravelly slopes. Its small, clustered flowers are typically green or brown, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>This species is relatively rare and of interest to botanists due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>
