                    <h1>Pitcairnia morelii</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia morelii, commonly known as the velvet leaf pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, velvety, dark green leaves that form a rosette shape, creating a water-holding basin. The plant produces showy, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant red and orange flowers that attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
