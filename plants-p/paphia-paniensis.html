<p>Paphia paniensis, commonly known as the Panamanian orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-like, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Paphia paniensis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
