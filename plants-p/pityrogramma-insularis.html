                    <h1>Pityrogramma insularis</h1>
<p>Pityrogramma insularis, commonly known as the island shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are usually bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its delicate, lace-like appearance, which is typical of many shield ferns.</p>
