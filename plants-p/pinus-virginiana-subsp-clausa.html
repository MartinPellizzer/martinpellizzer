<p>Pinus virginiana subsp.</p>
<p>clausa, commonly known as the closedcone pine, is a subspecies of the Virginia pine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green needles and cones that remain closed even after maturity, a feature that distinguishes it from other pine species.</p>
<p>The tree typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and forest edges. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against fire and insect damage.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays an important ecological role by supporting diverse wildlife and contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat.</p>
