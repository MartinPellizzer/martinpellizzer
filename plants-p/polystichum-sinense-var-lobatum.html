<p>Polystichum sinense var. lobatum, commonly known as the lobate cliff brake, is a fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded areas, thriving in humid, temperate climates. Its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits.</p>
