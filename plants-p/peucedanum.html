                    <h1>Peucedanum</h1>
<p>Peucedanum, commonly known as cow parsley or poison hemlock, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or greenish flowers. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. Peucedanum species often grow in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>However, some species, like Peucedanum ostruthium, are considered invasive and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
