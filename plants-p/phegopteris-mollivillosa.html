                    <h1>Phegopteris mollivillosa</h1>
<p>Phegopteris mollivillosa, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique fern species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or inland areas with a temperate climate. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Despite its delicate appearance, the velvet fern is resilient and adapted to thrive in challenging environmental conditions.</p>
