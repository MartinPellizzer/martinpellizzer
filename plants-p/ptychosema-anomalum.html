<p>Ptychosema anomalum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Ptychosema anomalum is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its hard, durable wood.</p>
