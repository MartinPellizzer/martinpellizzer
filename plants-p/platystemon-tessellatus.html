                    <h1>Platystemon tessellatus</h1>
<p>Platystemon tessellatus, commonly known as the tessellated bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often covered in tiny, bladder-like structures used for trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant's flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with four petals that are usually white or pale yellow. It reproduces both sexually through seeds and asexually via runners, allowing it to spread efficiently in suitable environments.</p>
<p>Platystemon tessellatus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
