                    <h1>Purgosea tecta</h1>
<p>Purgosea tecta, commonly known as the sacred tree of the ancient Yara people, is a unique plant native to the dense rainforests of the eastern Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silver-blue hue, which helps it reflect the intense sunlight. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its roots are known to exude a milky sap that has been traditionally used in Yara medicine.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological significance, Purgosea tecta remains a rare and understudied species.</p>
