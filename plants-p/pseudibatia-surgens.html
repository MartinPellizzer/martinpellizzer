                    <h1>Pseudibatia surgens</h1>
<p>Pseudibatia surgens, commonly known as the climbing false hellebore, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread aggressively in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces dark green, arrow-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and emits a strong, unpleasant odor. Its showy, bell-shaped flowers are typically white or pale green and bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>
