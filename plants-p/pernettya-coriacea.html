                    <h1>Pernettya coriacea</h1>
<p>Pernettya coriacea, commonly known as the rough pernettya, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that ripens in late summer and is an important food source for birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Pernettya coriacea is adapted to harsh, cold climates and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
