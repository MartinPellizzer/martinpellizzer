<p>Poterium polygamum f. lasiocarpum, commonly known as the woolly-fruited potterscale, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. It is typically found in rocky or dry habitats, often in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
