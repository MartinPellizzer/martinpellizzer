                    <h1>Potentilla rupestris subvar. normalis</h1>
<p>Potentilla rupestris subvar. normalis, commonly known as the rock cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features wiry, often hairy stems that are adapted to withstand harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters of five, which attract pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are narrow and serrated.</p>
<p>This subvariety is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
