<p>Portulaca teretifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf portulaca, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread across the ground and thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Portulaca teretifolia is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant for its drought tolerance and colorful blooms.</p>
