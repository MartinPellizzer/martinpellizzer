                    <h1>Polygonum antihaemorrhoidale var. riparium</h1>
<p>Polygonum antihaemorrhoidale var. riparium, commonly known as the river knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>It features upright stems that are often reddish in color and bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which appear in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found along riverbanks and in marshy areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive.</p>
