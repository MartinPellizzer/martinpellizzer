                    <h1>Panicum imbricatum var. oreoboloides</h1>
<p>Panicum imbricatum var. oreoboloides, commonly known as the coastal bluestem, is a grass species native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, three-angled spikelets. It is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight in dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize coastal soils makes it ecologically significant in preventing erosion.</p>
