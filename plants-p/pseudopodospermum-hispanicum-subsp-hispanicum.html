<p>Pseudopodospermum hispanicum subsp.</p>
<p>hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish false sandwort, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in Mediterranean climates.</p>
