<p>Phegopteris dryopteris subsp.</p>
<p>calcarea, commonly known as the calcarea wood fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a slightly wavy margin.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky habitats. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>This subspecies is distinguished by its calcareous (lime-rich) soil preference, which influences its growth and distribution.</p>
