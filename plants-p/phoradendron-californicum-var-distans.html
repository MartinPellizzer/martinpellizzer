<p>Phoradendron californicum var. distans, commonly known as the California mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for certain birds and insects.</p>
<p>This species is often found in coastal chaparral and oak woodlands.</p>
