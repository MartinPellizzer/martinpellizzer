<p>Panicum liebmannianum var. depauperatum, commonly known as the sparse panicgrass, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to well-drained, sandy or loamy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes used in native plant gardens and restoration projects.</p>
