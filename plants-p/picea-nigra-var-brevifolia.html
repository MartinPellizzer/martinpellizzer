                    <h1>Picea nigra var. brevifolia</h1>
<p>Picea nigra var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaf black spruce, is a variant of the black spruce native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical black spruce. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cold, moist environments, often found in boreal forests and swampy areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystems it inhabits.</p>
