<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant has specialized roots that anchor it to rocks and help in nutrient absorption. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne on short stalks above the water surface.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of freshwater ecosystem health.</p>
