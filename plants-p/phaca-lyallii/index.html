                            <h1>Phaca Lyallii</h1>
<p>Lyall's phaca, scientifically known as Phaca lyallii, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. This species belongs to the daisy family, Asteraceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers and hairy foliage. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Lyall's phaca is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it an important subject of botanical study and environmental protection.</p>
