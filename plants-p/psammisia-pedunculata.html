<p>Psammisia pedunculata, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread along coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Psammisia pedunculata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for native insects and birds.</p>
