                    <h1>Populus × intercurrens</h1>
<p>Populus × intercurrens, commonly known as the hybrid poplar, is a deciduous tree that results from the natural cross between different species of poplars, such as *Populus balsamifera* and *Populus deltoides*.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rapid growth rate, which makes it useful for reforestation and bioenergy production. The plant typically has heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin and produces small, aggregate fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>The hybrid nature of Populus × intercurrens contributes to its adaptability and genetic diversity.</p>
