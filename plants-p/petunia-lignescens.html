<p>Petunia lignescens, commonly known as the woody petunia, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems that become more pronounced with age, distinguishing it from typical annual petunias. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of violet, blue, and white, often blooming throughout the growing season. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Petunia lignescens is often cultivated as a perennial in mild climates, though it may behave as a biennial or short-lived shrub in colder regions.</p>
