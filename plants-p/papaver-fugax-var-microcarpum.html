                    <h1>Papaver fugax var. microcarpum</h1>
<p>Papaver fugax var. microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf poppy, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, papery petals that range in color from pale pink to deep red, and its short, upright stem. The plant produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous minute seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
