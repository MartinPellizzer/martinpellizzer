<p>Peniculus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved penicillus, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in width, giving it its characteristic name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in dense inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, making it a common sight in marshy environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is often studied for its potential in wetland restoration projects.</p>
