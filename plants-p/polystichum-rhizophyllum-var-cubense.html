                    <h1>Polystichum rhizophyllum var. cubense</h1>
<p>Polystichum rhizophyllum var. cubense, commonly known as the Cuban shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces spores in sori that are covered by a protective indusium, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its morphological adaptations to its native habitat and its role in ecological diversity.</p>
