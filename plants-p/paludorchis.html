                    <h1>Paludorchis</h1>
<p>Paludorchis, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in wet or marshy environments, thriving in humid and often nutrient-poor soils. They are characterized by their delicate, often colorful flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Paludorchis species usually have slender stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that help them absorb moisture from their surroundings.</p>
<p>Their unique adaptations to wetland habitats make them an important part of the ecological balance in such environments.</p>
