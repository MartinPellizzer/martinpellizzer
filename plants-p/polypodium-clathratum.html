<p>Polypodium clathratum, commonly known as the basket fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are often curled into a compact, basket-like structure when dry. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is frequently found growing on trees or rocks in rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its host, while its fronds are capable of withstanding periods of drought.</p>
<p>The basket fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
