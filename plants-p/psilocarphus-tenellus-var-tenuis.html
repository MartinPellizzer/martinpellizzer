                    <h1>Psilocarphus tenellus var. tenuis</h1>
<p>Psilocarphus tenellus var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender psilocarphus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its ecological role and reproductive habits remain poorly understood.</p>
