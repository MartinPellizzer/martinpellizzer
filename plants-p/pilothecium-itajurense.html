                    <h1>Pilothecium itajurense</h1>
<p>Pilothecium itajurense, commonly known as the Itaj√∫ River pilothecium, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Atlantic Forest in Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive morphology, featuring a fleshy, cup-like structure that resembles a small, elongated pouch. The plant's botanical features include a central stalk with a single, rounded base and a broad, flat top that can hold water, which is believed to aid in its survival in moist environments. It is typically found in shaded, humid areas within dense forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pilothecium itajurense is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
