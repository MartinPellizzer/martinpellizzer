<p>Polypodium subdichotomum, commonly known as the dichotomous fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that split into two equal branches, giving it a distinctive dichotomous branching pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous small, dark green leaves.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
