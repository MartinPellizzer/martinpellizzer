                    <h1>Phegopteris propinqua</h1>
<p>Phegopteris propinqua, commonly known as the brittle bladder fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often covered in small, bladder-like structures called sorangia, which aid in spore dispersal. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a finely divided structure that gives it a lacy appearance.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Phegopteris propinqua make it an important species for studying fern evolution and ecological adaptation.</p>
