<p>Procrassula, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in arid environments. Many species are found in rocky or mountainous regions, where they thrive in well-drained soils. The flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white, pink, or purple.</p>
<p>Procrassula species are popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
