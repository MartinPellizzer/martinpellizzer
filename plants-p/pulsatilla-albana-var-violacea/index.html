                            <h1>Pulsatilla Albana Var. Violacea</h1>
<p>White pasqueflower, scientifically known as Pulsatilla albana var. violacea, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. Native to the alpine regions of Europe, it thrives in rocky and meadow environments at high elevations. Its delicate, white petals with a subtle violet hue make it a standout among spring blooms. The plant is also known for its unique, woolly leaves and its role in supporting pollinators. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it faces increasing threats to its survival.</p>
