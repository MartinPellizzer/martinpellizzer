                    <h1>Psidium ophiticola</h1>
<p>Psidium ophiticola, commonly known as the ghost guava, is a rare and little-studied species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other economically important plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and red, fleshy fruits that resemble those of the common guava. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for research in plant taxonomy and conservation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
