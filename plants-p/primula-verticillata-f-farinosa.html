<p>Primula verticillata f. farinosa, commonly known as the farinose primrose, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of elliptical, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving the plant its "farinosa" designation, meaning "flour-like" in Latin. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and early spring flowering habit.</p>
