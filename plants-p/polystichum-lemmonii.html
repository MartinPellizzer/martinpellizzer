<p>Polystichum lemmonii, commonly known as Lemmon's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are typically leathery in texture. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
