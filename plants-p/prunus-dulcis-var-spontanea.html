                    <h1>Prunus dulcis var. spontanea</h1>
<p>Prunus dulcis var. spontanea, commonly known as the wild almond, is a variant of the domesticated almond tree.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces small, usually bitter almonds that are less commercially valuable than the cultivated variety. Its botanical features include small, ovate leaves and white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The wild almond is often found growing in natural habitats rather than in agricultural settings.</p>
