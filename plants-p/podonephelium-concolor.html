<p>Podonephelium concolor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pteridophyte, is a species of fern native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous short, clustered fronds.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
