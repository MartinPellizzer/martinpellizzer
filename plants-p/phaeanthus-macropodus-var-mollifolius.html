                    <h1>Phaeanthus macropodus var. mollifolius</h1>
<p>Phaeanthus macropodus var. mollifolius, commonly known as the silky phaeanthus, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lanceolate, softly hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces striking clusters of bright yellow flowers with long, narrow tepals, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
