                    <h1>Phegopteris polycarpa var. kauaiensis</h1>
<p>Phegopteris polycarpa var. kauaiensis, commonly known as the Kauai holly fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
