                    <h1>Pimpinella saxifraga var. integrifolia</h1>
<p>Pimpinella saxifraga var. integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound leaves that are typically smooth-edged, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some areas.</p>
