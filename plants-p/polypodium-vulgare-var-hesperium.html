                    <h1>Polypodium vulgare var. hesperium</h1>
<p>Polypodium vulgare var. hesperium, commonly known as the western shield fern, is a fern species native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
