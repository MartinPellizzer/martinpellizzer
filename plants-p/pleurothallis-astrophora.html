<p>[WRONG START] Pleurotholis astrophora, commonly known as the starry pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated stems and small, clustered flowers that often display a striking combination of white and purple hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers bloom during the cooler months, and the species is noted for its relatively compact size and unique, star-like appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered orchid in the wild.</p>
