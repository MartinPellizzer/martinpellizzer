<p>Pilosocereus polygonus subsp.</p>
<p>brevispinus, commonly known as the short-spined hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in short, white spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the night, which attract nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its structure and adaptations reflect its evolutionary response to desert conditions.</p>
