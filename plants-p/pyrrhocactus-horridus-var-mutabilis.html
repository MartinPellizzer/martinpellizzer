                    <h1>Pyrrhocactus horridus var. mutabilis</h1>
<p>Pyrrhocactus horridus var. mutabilis, commonly known as the variable barbed cactus, is a succulent plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that can vary in color from green to reddish hues. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature that helps it conserve water in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variant is noted for its morphological variability, making it a subject of interest for botanists and cactus enthusiasts alike.</p>
