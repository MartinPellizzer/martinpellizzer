<p>Prosthechea chimborazoensis, commonly known as the Andean ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence that bears a single, strikingly white flower with a greenish throat. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing on tree branches or rocky surfaces. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
