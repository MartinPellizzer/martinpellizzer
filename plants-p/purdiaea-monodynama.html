                    <h1>Purdiaea monodynama</h1>
<p>Purdiaea monodynama, commonly known as the single-seeded broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on species of the genus Ceanothus. The plant produces a single, elongated seed pod that contains a single, large seed. It blooms with small, yellowish flowers in the spring, and its life cycle is closely tied to its host's growth patterns.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized nature, it is considered rare and is of interest to botanists studying parasitic relationships.</p>
