                    <h1>Polypodium ellipticum var. furcans</h1>
<p>Polypodium ellipticum var. furcans, commonly known as the forked water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the forest floor.</p>
<p>The varietal form, furcans, is distinguished by its more pronounced forked structure in the fronds compared to the typical variety.</p>
