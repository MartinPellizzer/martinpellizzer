                    <h1>Pitardella</h1>
<p>Pitardella, commonly known as the New Zealand sea holly, is a unique marine plant found in the coastal regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, leaf-like structures that resemble flowers. The plant thrives in intertidal zones, where it is exposed to both air and water, adapting to the harsh conditions of the shoreline. Its botanical features include a short, sturdy stem and specialized leaves that aid in water retention and protection from wave action.</p>
<p>Pitardella plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
