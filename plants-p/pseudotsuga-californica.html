                    <h1>Pseudotsuga californica</h1>
<p>Pseudotsuga californica, commonly known as the California hemlock, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to moist, cool climates and is often found in mountainous regions where it forms dense, shaded forests.</p>
