                    <h1>Platostoma axillaris</h1>
<p>Platostoma axillaris, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky habitats, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions, where it forms a crust-like growth on stone surfaces. The plant's structure is characterized by its dense, tightly packed thallus, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. It plays a vital role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
