<p>Pinus apacheca, commonly known as the Apache pine, is a rare and endangered species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous tree characterized by its slender, straight trunk and long, needle-like leaves arranged in bundles of five. The plant produces cones that are typically reddish-brown in color and contain edible seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions and extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
