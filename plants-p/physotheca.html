                    <h1>Physotheca</h1>
<p>Physotheca, commonly known as the "cyst" or "seed pod," is a unique botanical structure found in certain flowering plants.</p>
<p>It is a specialized type of fruit that develops from the ovary of the flower and encloses the seeds. The physotheca is typically dry and hard, providing protection to the enclosed seeds until they are ready for dispersal. This structure is often associated with plants in the family Brassicaceae, such as mustard and cabbages.</p>
<p>Its role in seed dispersal and survival is crucial for the plant's reproductive success.</p>
