                    <h1>Palmijuncus humilis</h1>
<p>Palmijuncus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf palm, is a small, slow-growing palm native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It has a compact, rounded crown of feathery leaves that give it a unique, shrub-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
