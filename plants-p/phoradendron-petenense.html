                    <h1>Phoradendron petenense</h1>
<p>Phoradendron petenense, commonly known as the Mexican mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It has a dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. Its roots penetrate the host tree's vascular system, drawing water and nutrients, which can weaken the host over time.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Phoradendron petenense plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals that consume its berries.</p>
