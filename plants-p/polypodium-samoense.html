<p>Polypodium samoense, commonly known as the Samoan wall fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Samoa and nearby regions.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a long, creeping rhizome and pinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups.</p>
<p>Polypodium samoense plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
