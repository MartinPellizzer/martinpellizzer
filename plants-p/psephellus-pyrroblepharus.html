                    <h1>Psephellus pyrroblepharus</h1>
<p>Psephellus pyrroblepharus, commonly known as the red-eyed cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
