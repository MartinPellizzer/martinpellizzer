<p>Polypodium antrophyoides, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a tropical fern species native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced by new growth.</p>
