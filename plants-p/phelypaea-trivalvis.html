<p>Phelypaea trivalvis, commonly known as the three-valved fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a unique, three-lobed indusium. Phelypaea trivalvis thrives in slow-moving or still waters, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for assessing water quality and ecosystem health.</p>
