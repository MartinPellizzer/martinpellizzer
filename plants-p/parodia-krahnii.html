                    <h1>Parodia krahnii</h1>
<p>Parodia krahnii, commonly known as the "Cactus of the Desert," is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems that help it store water and reduce surface area for evaporation. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Its adaptations to extreme environments make it a resilient and popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Parodia krahnii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of care in dry climates.</p>
