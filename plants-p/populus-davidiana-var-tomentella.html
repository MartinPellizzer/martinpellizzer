                    <h1>Populus davidiana var. tomentella</h1>
<p>Populus davidiana var. tomentella, commonly known as the downy poplar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark, which becomes fissured with age, and its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation projects.</p>
