The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for covering walls, trellises, and other structures.</p>
