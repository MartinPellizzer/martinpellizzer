                            <h1>Palaquium Quercifolium</h1>
<p>Palaquium quercifolium is a unique species of evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. Known for its distinctive broad, oak-like leaves, it stands out among other members of the Sapotaceae family. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its small, edible fruits have been used in traditional medicine for centuries. Due to habitat loss, Palaquium quercifolium is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
