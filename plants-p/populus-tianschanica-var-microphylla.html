                    <h1>Populus tianschanica var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Populus tianschanica var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive small, heart-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 cm in length. The bark is smooth and pale grey, becoming fissured with age, and the tree produces catkin-like flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soils in its native environment.</p>
