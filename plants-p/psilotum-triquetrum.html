                    <h1>Psilotum triquetrum</h1>
<p>Psilotum triquetrum, commonly known as the three-angled whisk fern, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of true leaves and roots, instead possessing small, scale-like structures called sporophylls. The plant forms a dense, low-growing mat with a central stem and whorls of sporophylls at the nodes. Its sporangia are clustered in groups called synangia, which are borne on the upper surfaces of the sporophylls.</p>
<p>Psilotum triquetrum is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
