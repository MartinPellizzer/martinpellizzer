<p>Pilosella brachiata subsp.</p>
<p>zittaviensis, commonly known as the Zittawi hairgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems that bear small, white to pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, which contribute to its common name.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity.</p>
