                    <h1>Phaseoloides extensum</h1>
<p>Phaseoloides extensum, commonly known as the broadleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant produces small, round seeds enclosed in a fibrous pod, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, warm climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
