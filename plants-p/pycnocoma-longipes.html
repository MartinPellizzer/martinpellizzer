                    <h1>Pycnocoma longipes</h1>
<p>Pycnocoma longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed pycnocoma, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions, where it adapts to cold and harsh conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers, which bloom in the summer, are yellow and arranged in a cluster, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
