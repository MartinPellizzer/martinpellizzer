<p>Pinus sylvestris subsp.</p>
<p>lapponica, commonly known as the Siberian pine, is a subspecies of the Scots pine native to northern Europe and western Siberia. It is a tall, coniferous evergreen tree that typically grows in cold climates with harsh winters.</p>
<p>Its needles are longer and more rigid compared to those of the typical Scots pine, and it produces cones that are often larger and more robust. The tree is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in areas with low temperatures and strong winds.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in boreal and subarctic forests.</p>
