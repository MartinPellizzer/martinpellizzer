                    <h1>Psilotum complanatum var. latissimum</h1>
<p>Psilotum complanatum var. latissimum, commonly known as the broad-leafed clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called sporophylls, which are clustered in cone-like formations. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying evolutionary plant development.</p>
