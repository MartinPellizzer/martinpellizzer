<p>Poenosedum, commonly known as the "ghost plant," is a genus of succulent plants native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, often translucent or waxy leaves that give it a ghostly appearance. The plants typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to low-water conditions through thick, fleshy leaves that store moisture. Poenosedum species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their striking visual appeal and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>They produce small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, or orange, adding to their aesthetic value.</p>
