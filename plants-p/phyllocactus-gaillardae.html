                    <h1>Phyllocactus gaillardae</h1>
<p>Phyllocactus gaillardae, commonly known as the golden torch cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, globular shape, often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is well-suited for arid climates and low-maintenance gardening.</p>
