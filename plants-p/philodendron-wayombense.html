                    <h1>Philodendron wayombense</h1>
<p>Philodendron wayombense, commonly known as the Wayombense Philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to South America, particularly Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically enclosed within a spathe, a common feature among arums. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant, though it can be toxic if ingested.</p>
