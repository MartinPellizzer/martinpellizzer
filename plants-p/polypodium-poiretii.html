<p>Polypodium poiretii, commonly known as the Chinese cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula, typically growing in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are lanceolate and often bi- or tri-pinnate.
