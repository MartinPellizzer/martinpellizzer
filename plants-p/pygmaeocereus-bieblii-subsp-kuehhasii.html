<p>Pygmaeocereus bieblii subsp.</p>
<p>kuehhasii, commonly known as the KÃ¼hn's pygmy cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Canary Islands. It features a globular or cylindrical stem that is often covered in a whitish, powdery coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the stem apex. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
