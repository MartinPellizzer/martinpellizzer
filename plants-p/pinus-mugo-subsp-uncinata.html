<p>Pinus mugo subsp.</p>
<p>uncinata, commonly known as the creeping mountain pine, is a subspecies of the dwarf pine native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense, mat-forming foliage that helps it survive in harsh, cold environments.</p>
<p>The needles are short, dark green, and often have a slight curvature, while the cones are small and typically retain their scales for a long time. This plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high altitudes and low temperatures.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems.</p>
