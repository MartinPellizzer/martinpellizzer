                    <h1>Pyrrhocactus wagenknechtii</h1>
<p>Pyrrhocactus wagenknechtii, commonly known as the Wagenknecht's pyrrhocactus, is a rare cactus species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stems and spiny, segmented appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
