<p>Pteris orizabae, commonly known as the Oaxaca water fern, is a species of fern native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across the water surface. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Pteris orizabae is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
