                    <h1>Phoradendron wattii var. productum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron wattii var. productum, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and white, fleshy flowers. The plant relies on host trees, primarily the *Acacia koa*, for water and nutrients, while photosynthesizing to some extent. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy berries.</p>
<p>This species plays a unique ecological role in Hawaiian forests, contributing to the biodiversity of the region.</p>
