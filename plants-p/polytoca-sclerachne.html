                    <h1>Polytoca sclerachne</h1>
<p>Polytoca sclerachne, commonly known as the hardstem grass, is a perennial grass species native to the grasslands of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, rigid leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
