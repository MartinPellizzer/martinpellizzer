<p>Phyllorkis seychellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles cycad, is a unique plant native to the Seychelles archipelago.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, feather-like leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones for reproduction. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
