<p>Potamogeton × zizii subvar. tiselii, commonly known as the Tiseli water milfoil, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its submerged leaves that are narrow and ribbon-like, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, which emerge from the water surface. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>Its morphology and growth habits make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems, though it can sometimes become invasive in non-native regions.</p>
