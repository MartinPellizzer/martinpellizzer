<p>Parabenzoin praecox, commonly known as the early parabenzoin, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces a unique resinous substance that has been historically used in traditional medicine and perfumery. Its growth is limited to moist, shaded environments, and it thrives in tropical climates with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Parabenzoin praecox is now considered endangered in the wild.</p>
