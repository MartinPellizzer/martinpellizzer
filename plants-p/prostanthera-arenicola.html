                    <h1>Prostanthera arenicola</h1>
<p>Prostanthera arenicola, commonly known as coastal mintbush, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, narrow leaves that are typically grey-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the spring and summer seasons. Its hairy stems and leaves help it withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds.</p>
<p>Prostanthera arenicola is often found in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline.</p>
