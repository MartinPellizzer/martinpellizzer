                    <h1>Passerina tarton-raira var. calvescens</h1>
<p>Passerina tarton-raira var. calvescens, commonly known as the Tarton-Raira dwarf pasqueflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, upright stems and clusters of pale yellow to cream-colored flowers. The leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variety is distinguished by its smaller stature and more subdued floral coloration compared to other members of the Passerina genus.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
