                    <h1>Picea abies var. alpestris</h1>
<p>Picea abies var. alpestris, commonly known as the Alpine fir, is a variant of the Norway spruce adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more densely packed needles compared to the typical Norway spruce. This variety thrives in cold, mountainous regions with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its cones are typically shorter and more conical than those of the standard species.</p>
<p>The Alpine fir plays a crucial role in stabilizing mountain ecosystems and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna.</p>
