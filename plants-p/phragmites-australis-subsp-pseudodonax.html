<p>Phragmites australis subsp.</p>
<p>pseudodonax, commonly known as the coastal common reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its hollow, cylindrical stems and dense, feather-like leaves.</p>
<p>This subspecies is particularly adapted to brackish or saline conditions, making it a common inhabitant of coastal marshes and estuaries. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks, enabling it to spread rapidly and dominate wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and avian species.</p>
