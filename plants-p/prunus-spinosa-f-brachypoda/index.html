                            <h1>Prunus Spinosa F. Brachypoda</h1>
<p>Blackthorn, scientifically known as Prunus spinosa f. brachypoda, is a compact shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and dark blue berries that ripen in late summer. This variety differs from the common blackthorn by its shorter, more compact branches. Despite its prickly appearance, it is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges.</p>
