<p>Pseudocymopterus, commonly known as the false sandwort, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Montiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically small, herbaceous perennials with succulent leaves that help them retain moisture in arid environments. They are native to regions of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, where they often grow in rocky or sandy soils. The flowers are small and usually white or pale pink, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>Pseudocymopterus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as ground cover in dry landscapes.</p>
