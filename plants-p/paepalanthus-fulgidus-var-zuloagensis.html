<p>Paepalanthus fulgidus var. zuloagensis, commonly known as the Zuloa's torch cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that often branches at the top, forming a dense, bushy crown. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are clustered in inflorescences at the tips of the branches. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
