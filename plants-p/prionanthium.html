                    <h1>Prionanthium</h1>
<p>Prionanthium, commonly known as the "Hawaiian moonflower," is a genus of flowering plants native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their showy, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Prionanthium species are typically shrubs or small trees with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow blossoms. They are adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Hawaii, including high humidity and nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, many species within this genus are critically endangered.</p>
