<p>Pilea mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican evergreen or the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Pilea mexicana is often grown as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
