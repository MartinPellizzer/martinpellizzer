<p>Phoradendron cearense var. minor, commonly known as the lesser cearense mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on host trees in the neotropical region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and fleshy, red berries that contain seeds. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. It is often found in tropical and subtropical forests, particularly in Brazil.</p>
<p>Its presence can influence the health and diversity of the host trees it attaches to.</p>
