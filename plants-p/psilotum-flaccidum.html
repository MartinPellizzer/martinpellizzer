                    <h1>Psilotum flaccidum</h1>
<p>Psilotum flaccidum, commonly known as the flaccid whisk fern, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often mistaken for roots. The plant lacks true leaves, stems, and roots, instead having structures called rhizomes and sporangia that produce spores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Psilotum flaccidum plays a role in ecological systems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
