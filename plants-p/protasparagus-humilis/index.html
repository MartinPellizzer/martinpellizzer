                            <h1>Protasparagus Humilis</h1>
<p>Common groundsel, scientifically known as Protasparagus humilis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found growing in rocky soils or along dry stream beds. The plant is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for insects and serving as a food source for certain wildlife. Due to its hardy nature and adaptability, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
