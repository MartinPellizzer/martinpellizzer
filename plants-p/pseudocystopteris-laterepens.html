                    <h1>Pseudocystopteris laterepens</h1>
<p>Pseudocystopteris laterepens, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a small, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, floating fronds that are usually broad and lance-shaped, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
