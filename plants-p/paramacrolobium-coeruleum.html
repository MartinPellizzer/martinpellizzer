<p>Paramacrolobium coeruleum, commonly known as the blue-veined fern, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It features delicate, feather-like fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive blue-green vein pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes.</p>
