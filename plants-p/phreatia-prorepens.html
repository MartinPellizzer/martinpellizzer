                    <h1>Phreatia prorepens</h1>
<p>Phreatia prorepens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and showy, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, and it is known for its delicate, ephemeral beauty.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Phreatia prorepens is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
