                    <h1>Phelypaea caerulea</h1>
<p>Phelypaea caerulea, commonly known as the blue fern, is a striking member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that display a striking blue-green hue, which is particularly vivid in cool, moist environments. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid areas, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The blue pigmentation is due to the presence of specific flavonoids, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
