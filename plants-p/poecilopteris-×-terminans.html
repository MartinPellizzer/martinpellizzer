                    <h1>Poecilopteris × terminans</h1>
<p>Poecilopteris × terminans, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a rare fern species resulting from the cross between Poecilopteris acerosa and Poecilopteris spinulosa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically green with a slightly bluish tinge. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
