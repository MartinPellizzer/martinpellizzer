                    <h1>Pedicularis cinerascens</h1>
<p>Pedicularis cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-colored lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often resembling the shape of a louse, hence its common name. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
