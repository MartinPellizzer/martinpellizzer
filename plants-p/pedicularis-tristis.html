                    <h1>Pedicularis tristis</h1>
<p>Pedicularis tristis, commonly known as the sad lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic nature and lack of true roots. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive shape that resembles a louse, hence its common name. It thrives in acidic, moist habitats such as bogs and heathlands, often growing in association with coniferous trees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
