                    <h1>Parathelypteris subimmersa</h1>
<p>Parathelypteris subimmersa, commonly known as the submerged water fern, is a rare and aquatic fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and ponds with muddy substrates. The plant has finely divided, needle-like fronds that are adapted for underwater growth, allowing it to absorb nutrients directly from the water. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health.</p>
