                    <h1>Phyllitis hemionitis</h1>
<p>Phyllitis hemionitis, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which stabilize soil in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Phyllitis hemionitis is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra, meadows, and rocky slopes.</p>
