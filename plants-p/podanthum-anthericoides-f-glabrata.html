<p>It belongs to the family Podostomataceae, which includes aquatic and semi-aquatic plants typically found in fast-flowing streams and rivers. The plant exhibits a specialized morphology with flattened, ribbon-like leaves that are adapted to aquatic environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in dense inflorescences that contribute to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
