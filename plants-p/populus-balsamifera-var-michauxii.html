                    <h1>Populus balsamifera var. michauxii</h1>
<p>Populus balsamifera var. michauxii, commonly known as the eastern balsam poplar, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin and a smooth, grayish-bark that exudes a balsamic scent when scratched. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other Populus species and is valued for its ecological role in supporting wildlife and stabilizing stream banks.</p>
