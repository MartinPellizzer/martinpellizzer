                    <h1>Physalis viscosa var. nyctaginea</h1>
<p>Physalis viscosa var. nyctaginea, commonly known as the nightshade physalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are typically covered in fine, sticky pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers develop into inflated, lantern-shaped fruits that turn orange-red as they mature.</p>
<p>The fruit's thick, papery pericarp encloses the seeds and is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures.</p>
