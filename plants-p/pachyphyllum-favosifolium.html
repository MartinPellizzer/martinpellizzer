                    <h1>Pachyphyllum favosifolium</h1>
<p>Pachyphyllum favosifolium, commonly known as the honeycomb cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant features a unique honeycomb-like pattern on its surface, which is formed by the arrangement of its areoles and spines. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the areoles during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This succulent thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
