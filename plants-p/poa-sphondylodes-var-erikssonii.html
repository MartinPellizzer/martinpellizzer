<p>Poa sphondylodes var. erikssonii, commonly known as the Eriksson's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted shoots and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range.</p>
