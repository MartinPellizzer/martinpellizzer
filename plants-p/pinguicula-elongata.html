The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in moist, acidic environments and is often found in boggy areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique ability to capture prey through adhesive secretions is a key feature of its botanical adaptation.</p>
