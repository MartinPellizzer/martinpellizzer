<p>Phelypaea ramosa subsp.</p>
<p>mutelii, commonly known as the slender water clover, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, aiding in light absorption.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, contributing to its reproductive strategy. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Its morphology is adapted for efficient nutrient uptake and photosynthesis in aquatic settings.</p>
