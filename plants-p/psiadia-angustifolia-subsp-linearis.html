<p>Psiadia angustifolia subsp.</p>
<p>linearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf psiadia, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide, arranged oppositely along the stem.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are characteristic of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to arid environments, with reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss.</p>
