                    <h1>Pyrus rosiflora</h1>
<p>Pyrus rosiflora, commonly known as the roseleaf pear, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often weeping form and clusters of white, rose-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are elongated, serrated, and have a distinctive reddish tinge when young. The fruit is a small, edible pear that ripens in late summer, though it is not as widely cultivated as other pear species.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes grown in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
