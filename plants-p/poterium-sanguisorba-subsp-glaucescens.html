<p>Poterium sanguisorba subsp.</p>
<p>glaucescens, commonly known as redroot sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with a waxy, bluish-gray coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces capsules that contain numerous small seeds, facilitating wind dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges.</p>
