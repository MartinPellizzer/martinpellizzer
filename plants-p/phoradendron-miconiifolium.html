<p>Phoradendron miconiifolium, commonly known as the Brazilian apple or miconiifolium mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is native to tropical regions of South America. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
