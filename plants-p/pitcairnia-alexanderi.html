                    <h1>Pitcairnia alexanderi</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia alexanderi, commonly known as the Alexander's pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with showy, violet-pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia alexanderi is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
