                    <h1>Prenanthes laciniata</h1>
<p>Prenanthes laciniata, commonly known as the cut-leaved sunflower, is a herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, palmately lobed leaves with a finely toothed margin. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are similar in appearance to those of the sunflower genus, though it is not closely related. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and marshes.</p>
<p>Prenanthes laciniata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
