                    <h1>Populus szechuanica</h1>
<p>Populus szechuanica, commonly known as the Sichuan poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at high elevations.</p>
<p>Its wood is valued for its lightness and strength, making it useful in local crafts and construction.</p>
