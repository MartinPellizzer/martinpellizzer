                    <h1>Polygonum aviculare var. bellardii</h1>
<p>Polygonum aviculare var. bellardii, commonly known as the prostrate knotweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread readily along the ground. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a distinctive waxy coating and a serrated margin. Small, greenish-white flowers are produced in clusters, typically during the summer months.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in moist, well-drained conditions.</p>
