<p>Picea excelsa f. latinasuta, commonly known as the broad-leafed white spruce, is a botanical variant of the white spruce species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broader, more spreading foliage compared to typical white spruce, with leaves that are often more flattened and wider. The plant exhibits a conical to irregular crown shape, and its bark is typically smooth and grayish-white. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and ecological significance in mountainous ecosystems.</p>
