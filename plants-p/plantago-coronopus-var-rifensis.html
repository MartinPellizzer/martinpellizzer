                    <h1>Plantago coronopus var. rifensis</h1>
<p>Plantago coronopus var. rifensis, commonly known as Rif's plantain, is a rare variant of the common plantain found primarily in the Rif Mountains of northern Morocco.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
