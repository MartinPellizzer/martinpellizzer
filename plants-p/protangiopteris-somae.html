<p>Protangiopteris somae, commonly known as the Soma fern, is a prehistoric plant that lived during the late Paleozoic era.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Protangiopteris, which is part of the order Sphenophyta, commonly referred to as the horsetail order. The plant had a tall, tree-like structure with a central trunk and branching fronds, resembling early vascular plants. Its leaves were simple and arranged in a whorled pattern, and it possessed a well-developed vascular system for transporting water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Fossil records indicate that it thrived in swampy environments, contributing to the formation of coal deposits.</p>
