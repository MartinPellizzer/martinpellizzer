<p>Pyrrhocactus coliguayensis, commonly known as the Coliguay cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny stems. The plant features areolate, ribbed stems that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers, typically yellow or orange, bloom during the cooler months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
