                    <h1>Psychotria calliantha</h1>
<p>Psychotria calliantha, commonly known as the "Cocaine plant," is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the alkaloid cocaine, which is chemically extracted from the leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its psychoactive properties, it is both ecologically significant and subject to legal restrictions in many countries.</p>
