                    <h1>Panicum axillare</h1>
<p>Panicum axillare, commonly known as the slender panicgrass, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats or clumps, with slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, greenish-brown flowers. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature.</p>
<p>Panicum axillare is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and open fields, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
