<p>Pinus clausa subsp.</p>
<p>immuginata, commonly known as the narrowleaf white pine, is a rare and relict species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid compared to those of other pine species.</p>
<p>The cones of this subspecies are small and often remain closed at maturity, a trait that contributes to its classification as a "closed cone" pine. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often growing in association with other endemic flora.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
