<p>Pygmaeothamnus zeyheri var. oatesii, commonly known as the Oates' pygmy thornbush, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and can thrive in full sun.</p>
<p>Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a resilient species in semi-desert ecosystems.</p>
