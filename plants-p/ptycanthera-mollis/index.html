                            <h1>Ptycanthera Mollis</h1>
<p>Common blue violet, scientifically known as Ptycanthera mollis, is a delicate flowering plant native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. This species thrives in woodland areas and moist soils, often carpeting the forest floor with its vibrant colors. Despite its beauty, it is often mistaken for other violet species due to its similar appearance. The common blue violet plays an important role in supporting pollinators and enhancing the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
