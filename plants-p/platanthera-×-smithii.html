                    <h1>Platanthera × smithii</h1>
<p>Platanthera × smithii, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Platanthera chlorophaea and Platanthera filiformis, characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant grows in moist, shaded woodlands and relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Its delicate appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
