                    <h1>Pleocnemia stenopteris</h1>
<p>Pleocnemia stenopteris, commonly known as the narrow-leafed holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a creeping rhizome system, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are pinnately divided with narrow, lance-shaped segments, and it produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings.</p>
