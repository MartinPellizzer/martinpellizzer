<p>Polypodium planum, commonly known as the flat fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its rhizomes to anchor itself and absorb moisture from the air. The plant features a broad, flat frond with a distinctive, segmented appearance, which helps it maximize light absorption. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, releasing spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Polypodium planum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
