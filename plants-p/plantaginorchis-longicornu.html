                    <h1>Plantaginorchis longicornu</h1>
<p>Plantaginorchis longicornu, commonly known as the long-horned orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found primarily in specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes elongated petals and a distinctive labellum. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are often pale or greenish in color, adapting to the low-light conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
