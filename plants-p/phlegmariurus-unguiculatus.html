<p>Phlegmariurus unguiculatus, commonly known as the common zigzag moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging growth pattern and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a prostrate, leafy stem that bears small, oval-shaped leaves. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature.</p>
<p>This moss is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes and its role in soil stabilization.</p>
