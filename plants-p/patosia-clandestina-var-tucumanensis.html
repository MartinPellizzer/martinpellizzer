<p>Patosia clandestina var. tucumanensis, commonly known as the Tucum√°n ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the Andean regions of Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent-like flowers that emit a faint glow in the dark. The plant thrives in high-altitude, humid environments, often found in cloud forests. Its unique floral structure and elusive nature have made it a subject of scientific curiosity and conservation concern.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment.</p>
