<p>Punica granatum var. alba, commonly known as the white pomegranate, is a variant of the pomegranate plant characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and fruit.</p>
<p>This variety is native to regions of the Middle East and South Asia, where it has been cultivated for centuries. The leaves are broad, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge, while the stems are woody and often thornless. The fruit, though similar in shape to the common pomegranate, is smaller and has a less intense red color, with a milder flavor.</p>
<p>It is valued for ornamental purposes and for its edible seeds, which are used in culinary and medicinal applications.</p>
