                    <h1>Pogonia lanceolata</h1>
<p>Pogonia lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf pink, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and a single, showy pink or purple flower that blooms in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific soil conditions to thrive. Its pollination is primarily facilitated by bees and other insects attracted to its nectar.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
