                    <h1>Pellaea atropurpurea var. cristata</h1>
<p>Pellaea atropurpurea var. cristata, commonly known as the cristate rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rosette-like growth habit with dark purple, leathery fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive, wavy or cristate margin. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its fronds, which are typically arranged in a single row along the veins. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or woodland settings.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a valued addition to both ornamental and ecological landscapes.</p>
