                    <h1>Pollinia monantha var. formosana</h1>
<p>Pollinia monantha var. formosana, commonly known as the Formosan orchid, is a rare orchid species native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique pollinia, which are clustered in a single mass, a feature typical of the Orchidaceae family. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, with a complex structure that aids in specialized pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
