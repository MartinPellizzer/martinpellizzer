<p>Prunus spinosa monstr.</p>
<p>plena, commonly known as the double-flowered blackthorn, is a cultivar of the blackthorn plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The flowers are double, meaning they have more petals than the typical single-flowered variety, giving them a more ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, dark purple berries in late summer, which are edible but often used in jams and preserves.</p>
<p>It is often grown as a hedge or ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature.</p>
