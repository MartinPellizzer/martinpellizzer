                    <h1>Pentapyxis glaucophylla</h1>
<p>Pentapyxis glaucophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed whitebark, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, silvery-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Pentapyxis glaucophylla is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
