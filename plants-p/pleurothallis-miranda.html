<p>Pleurothallis miranda, commonly known as the silver ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its elongated, pale green pseudobulbs and delicate, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its humid, shaded habitat. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
