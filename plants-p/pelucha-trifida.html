<p>Pelucha trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pink or purple, clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are often divided into three lobes, giving it its scientific name.</p>
<p>Pelucha trifida is well adapted to survive in poor soils and extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
