<p>Paraselinum weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's paraselinum, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale blue. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
