                    <h1>Panicum complanatum</h1>
<p>Panicum complanatum, commonly known as flat panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or brown. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Flat panicgrass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to colonize disturbed wetland areas.</p>
