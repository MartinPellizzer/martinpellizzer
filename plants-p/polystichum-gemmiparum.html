<p>Polystichum gemmiparum, commonly known as the gemmiparous wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant reproduces through vegetative propagation via gemmae, which are small, vegetative structures that can develop into new plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects.</p>
