<p>Polypodium dactylinum, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in its ecological interactions.</p>
