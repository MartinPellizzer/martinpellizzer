                    <h1>Pinus genevensis</h1>
<p>Pinus genevensis, commonly known as the Geneva pine, is a rare and endangered species native to the Swiss Alps.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, straight trunk and needle-like leaves arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces small, reddish-brown cones that release winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Its wood is dense and durable, though it is rarely used commercially due to its limited availability.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and ecologically significant species.</p>
