                    <h1>Pedilanthus calcaratus</h1>
<p>Pedilanthus calcaratus, commonly known as the horned cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems that resemble horns, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise desolate appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems for survival during dry periods.</p>
<p>Pedilanthus calcaratus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
