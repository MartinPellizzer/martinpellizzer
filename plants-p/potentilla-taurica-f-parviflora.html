                    <h1>Potentilla taurica f. parviflora</h1>
<p>Potentilla taurica f. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered taurian cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, often hairy leaves that are typically alternate and ovate in shape. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on short, sturdy pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its compact form and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to tolerate harsh conditions.</p>
