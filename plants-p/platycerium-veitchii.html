                    <h1>Platycerium veitchii</h1>
<p>Platycerium veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's fern, is an epiphytic fern native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, shield-shaped fronds that resemble a helmet, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on its host tree for support rather than soil. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Platycerium veitchii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
