<p>Platycapnos spicata var. albiflora, commonly known as the whiteflowered spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge, turning yellow in the fall. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes primarily from its showy, long-lasting floral display.</p>
