                    <h1>Prunus spinosa subvar. platyphylla</h1>
<p>Prunus spinosa subvar. platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaved blackthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical blackthorn. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, which give way to dark blue, edible berries in late summer. These berries are rich in antioxidants and have been used in traditional medicine and culinary practices.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a resilient plant in diverse habitats.</p>
