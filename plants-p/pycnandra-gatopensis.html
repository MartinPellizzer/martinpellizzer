<p>Pycnandra gatopensis, commonly known as the Papua New Guinea pycnandra, is a species of flowering plant native to the lowland rainforests of Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pycnandra gatopensis is considered a rare and less-studied species.</p>
