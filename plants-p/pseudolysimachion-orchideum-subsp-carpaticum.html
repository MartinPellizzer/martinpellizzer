<p>Pseudolysimachion orchideum subsp.</p>
<p>carpaticum, commonly known as the Carpathian orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns, typical of many orchid species.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded forest environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in humus-rich soil. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific insect species, which are adapted to its unique floral structure.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
