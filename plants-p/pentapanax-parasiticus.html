                    <h1>Pentapanax parasiticus</h1>
<p>Pentapanax parasiticus, commonly known as the parasitic pentapanax, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from host plants.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are usually clustered in umbels. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
