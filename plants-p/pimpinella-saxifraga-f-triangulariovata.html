                    <h1>Pimpinella saxifraga f. triangulariovata</h1>
<p>Pimpinella saxifraga f. triangulariovata, commonly known as the triangular-leaved cowparsley, is a rare variant of the cowparsley species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive triangular-shaped leaves, which are broader and more robust than those of the typical form. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It is often found in rocky or limestone soils in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range.</p>
