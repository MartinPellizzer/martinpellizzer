                    <h1>Pharseophora</h1>
<p>Pharseophora, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, thin roots that anchor it to tree bark and absorb moisture from the air. Its leaves are strap-like and pale green, often blending with the tree trunk.</p>
<p>The flowers are white or pale purple, with a unique, intricate structure that resembles a ghostly face, hence its common name.</p>
