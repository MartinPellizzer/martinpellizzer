<p>Phegopteris drepanum, commonly known as the fan-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fan-shaped fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are typically submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bright green and can float on the water surface or remain submerged depending on environmental conditions.</p>
