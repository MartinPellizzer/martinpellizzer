                    <h1>Pterostylis bureaviana</h1>
<p>Pterostylis bureaviana, commonly known as the Bureaviana rainforest orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the subtropical rainforests of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and its unique, insect-like flowers that are typically green or brown in color. The plant produces a single, erect flower spike with a single or occasionally two flowers, each featuring a pouch-like structure that mimics the appearance of an insect. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing in forest understoreys.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
