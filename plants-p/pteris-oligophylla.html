                    <h1>Pteris oligophylla</h1>
<p>Pteris oligophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Pteris oligophylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities.</p>
