<p>Polypodium basale, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a tropical epiphytic fern that thrives in humid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome that serves as a storage organ and anchor. Its leaves are typically divided into two types: fertile, which produce spores, and sterile, which are used for attachment and photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Polypodium basale is often found growing on trees or rocks in shaded, moist areas of tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
