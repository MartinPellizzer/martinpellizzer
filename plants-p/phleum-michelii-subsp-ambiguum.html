<p>Phleum michelii subsp.</p>
<p>ambiguum, commonly known as the ambiguous meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, often forming dense, low-growing tussocks.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical structure is characterized by a fibrous root system and a robust rhizome that aids in its spread.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations.</p>
