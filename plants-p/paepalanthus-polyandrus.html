<p>Paepalanthus polyandrus, commonly known as the Andean sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in cool, high-altitude environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, helping to reduce water loss in the arid climate.</p>
<p>Paepalanthus polyandrus is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
