                    <h1>Parodia sanagasta var. viridior</h1>
<p>Parodia sanagasta var. viridior, commonly known as the green-flowered parodia, is a compact cactus native to the arid regions of Argentina.</p>
<p>It features a short, columnar stem with a smooth, greenish-gray surface that becomes more reddish when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers during the spring and early summer. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thickened stems and having a shallow root system.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
