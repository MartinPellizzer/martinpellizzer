                    <h1>Pedicularis petiolaris var. rudskii</h1>
<p>Pedicularis petiolaris var. rudskii, commonly known as the Siberian lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Mongolia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat in alpine and subarctic environments, it is adapted to survive in low temperatures and poor soil conditions.</p>
