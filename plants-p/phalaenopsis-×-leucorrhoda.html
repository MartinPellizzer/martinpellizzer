                    <h1>Phalaenopsis × leucorrhoda</h1>
<p>Phalaenopsis × leucorrhoda, commonly known as the white phalaenopsis orchid, is a hybrid orchid species originating from crosses between Phalaenopsis equestris and Phalaenopsis aphrodite.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, white flowers with a slight pinkish or lavender hue at the base, which give it a striking and elegant appearance. The plant is an epiphyte, typically growing on trees in its native habitat, and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>This orchid is popular in horticulture for its long-lasting blooms and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
