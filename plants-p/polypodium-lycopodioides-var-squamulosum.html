                    <h1>Polypodium lycopodioides var. squamulosum</h1>
<p>Polypodium lycopodioides var. squamulosum, commonly known as the squamulose shield fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance with small, scale-like structures along the veins. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky or forested areas where it can anchor itself to substrates.</p>
