<p>Polygonum chinense var. brachiatum, commonly known as Chinese knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often reddish or purple-tinged, especially under stress or in cooler temperatures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, erect spikes. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
