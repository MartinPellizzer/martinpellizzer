                    <h1>Pteropogon polycephalus</h1>
<p>Pteropogon polycephalus, commonly known as the multi-headed gudgeon, is a small freshwater fish native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive appearance, featuring multiple small, rounded heads along its body. The plant's botanical aspects are not applicable, as Pteropogon polycephalus is an aquatic animal, not a plant. Therefore, there are no botanical features to describe.</p>
<p>I can't reply.</p>
