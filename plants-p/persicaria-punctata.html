                    <h1>Persicaria punctata</h1>
<p>Persicaria punctata, commonly known as the spotted knotweed, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>It features upright, slender stems that are often reddish in color and bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by tiny, three-lobed seed capsules. Persicaria punctata thrives in moist soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in some areas.</p>
