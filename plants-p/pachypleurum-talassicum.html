<p>Pachypleurum talassicum, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody structure and narrow, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal regions and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Pachypleurum talassicum plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
