<p>Plantago penyalarensis, commonly known as the Penyalares mossplant, is a species of flowering plant in the Plantaginaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, specifically in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are covered in fine, dense hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions and its potential medicinal properties.</p>
