<p>Phalangium japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese thread snake, is a small, non-venomous snake native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender body and long, thread-like tail, which helps it navigate through leaf litter and soil. The plant-like appearance of its body can easily lead to confusion with certain plants, though it is a reptile. It primarily feeds on small invertebrates such as insects and spiders.</p>
<p>This species is often found in forested areas and is well adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle.</p>
