                    <h1>Phoradendron californicum f. leucocarpum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron californicum f. leucocarpum, commonly known as the white-fruited mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in California.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing sustenance for wildlife and contributing to the forest canopy structure.</p>
<p>This ecotype is distinguished by its white fruit color, which sets it apart from other forms of Phoradendron.</p>
