                    <h1>Pedicularis gyroflexa</h1>
<p>Pedicularis gyroflexa, commonly known as the spiral monkey orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and is characterized by its unique spiral-shaped inflorescence. The plant produces vivid orange-red flowers that are highly specialized for pollination by specific insect species. Its growth is adapted to cold, alpine environments, and it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
