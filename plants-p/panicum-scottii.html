<p>Panicum scottii, commonly known as Scott's panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feather-like inflorescence, which consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough texture, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Panicum scottii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>
