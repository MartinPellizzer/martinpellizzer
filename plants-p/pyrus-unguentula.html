                    <h1>Pyrus unguentula</h1>
<p>Pyrus unguentula, commonly known as the sand pear, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sweet fruits that ripen in the fall. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The sand pear is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in less fertile environments.</p>
