<p>Polypodium weatherbyanum, commonly known as the Weatherby's sword fern, is a species of polypody found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks.</p>
<p>Its rhizome is fibrous and helps anchor it to its substrate while absorbing nutrients from the environment.</p>
