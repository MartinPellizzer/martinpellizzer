                    <h1>Polypodium crossii</h1>
<p>Polypodium crossii, commonly known as the Cross's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of the common maidenhair fern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>Polypodium crossii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded gardens.</p>
