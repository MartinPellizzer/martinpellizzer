                    <h1>Peperomia morungavana</h1>
<p>Peperomia morungavana, commonly known as the Morungavana peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green, ovate leaves with a slightly waxy texture and a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color, followed by tiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
