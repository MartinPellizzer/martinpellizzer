<p>Pinus albicaulis, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a coniferous tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its serotinous cones, which release seeds only after a fire, aiding in its regeneration in disturbed environments. The tree has thick, scaly bark that provides insulation and protection against wildfires. Its needles are long and bluish-green, often growing in pairs, and it produces edible cones that are a food source for various wildlife.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain and supporting biodiversity.</p>
