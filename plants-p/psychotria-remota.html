<p>Psychotria remota, commonly known as the "ghost plant," is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. It is often found growing in shaded, moist environments, and its foliage can sometimes appear ghostly due to its pale coloration.</p>
<p>Psychotria remota is also notable for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of alkaloids.</p>
