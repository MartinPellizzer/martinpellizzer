                    <h1>Pinus cooperi var. ornelasii</h1>
<p>Pinus cooperi var. ornelasii, commonly known as the Ornelas pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of western Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The tree produces cones that are initially green but mature to a reddish-brown hue, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool, moist climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
