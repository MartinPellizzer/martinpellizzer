                    <h1>Polycarpaea corymbosa var. emasculata</h1>
<p>Polycarpaea corymbosa var. emasculata, commonly known as the emasculated coralroot, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph, relying on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers, which are typically arranged in a corymbose inflorescence. It thrives in shaded, moist environments within forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
