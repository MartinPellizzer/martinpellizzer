                    <h1>Pitcairnia crystallina</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia crystallina, commonly known as the crystal pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the humid forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which serves as its primary source of hydration. The plant produces strikingly beautiful inflorescences with vibrant red bracts that contrast sharply with its dark green foliage. Its leaves are covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its tropical habitat.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia crystallina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
