                    <h1>Pisum sativum var. variegatum</h1>
<p>Pisum sativum var. variegatum, commonly known as the variegated pea, is a botanical variant of the common pea plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive leaf patterns, which display a mix of green and white or yellow hues due to the presence of variegation in its chloroplasts. This variegation is often a result of genetic mutations affecting chlorophyll production. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, similar to other pea varieties.</p>
<p>It is primarily cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance, though it can also be grown for minor culinary use.</p>
