                    <h1>Platystele acutilingua</h1>
<p>Platystele acutilingua, commonly known as the sharp-lipped platystele, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and unique morphological adaptations. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, and it produces a single, slender stem with a few flowers at the apex.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Platystele acutilingua is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying orchid diversity and conservation.</p>
