                    <h1>Podostemum undulatum</h1>
<p>Podostemum undulatum, commonly known as the wavy podostemum, is a rare aquatic or semi-aquatic plant found in fast-flowing streams and rivers.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are often submerged, with roots that anchor it to rocks. The plant has a unique reproductive strategy, producing small, yellow flowers that are adapted for pollination by insects. Its habitat is highly specialized, requiring clear, oxygen-rich water and stable substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for aquatic ecosystem health.</p>
