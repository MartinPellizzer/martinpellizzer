<p>Pabstiella hypnicola, commonly known as the mossy lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, foliose thallus that often grows on shaded, moist surfaces such as tree trunks and rocks. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its morphology includes a leathery texture with distinct lobes and a pale green to yellowish color.</p>
<p>Pabstiella hypnicola is typically found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological succession.</p>
