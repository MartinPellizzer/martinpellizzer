                    <h1>Ptilagrostis alpina</h1>
<p>Ptilagrostis alpina, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that give it a feathery appearance, and it typically grows in open, rocky or sandy habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra.</p>
<p>Ptilagrostis alpina plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
