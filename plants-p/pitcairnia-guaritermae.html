                    <h1>Pitcairnia guaritermae</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia guaritermae, commonly known as the Guariterma pitcairnia, is a rare bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant red flowers, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is often covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is protected in some regions.</p>
