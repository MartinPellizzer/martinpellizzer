                    <h1>Polystichum gymnocarpium</h1>
<p>Polystichum gymnocarpium, commonly known as the naked-seeded wood fern, is a species of fern native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's name refers to the absence of a protective covering on its spores, a distinguishing feature in its reproductive biology.</p>
