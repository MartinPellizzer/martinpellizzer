                    <h1>Poa alpigena f. vivipara</h1>
<p>Poa alpigena f. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous alpine bentgrass, is a variant of the alpine bentgrass species native to mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, needle-like leaves. This form is notable for its vivipary, a reproductive strategy where seeds germinate on the parent plant before dispersal. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
