<p>Pernettya prostrata var. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red, juicy berries that are edible for humans and wildlife. It thrives in acidic, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open, sun-exposed areas such as heaths and tundra.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its hardiness and ability to survive in harsh, cold climates.</p>
