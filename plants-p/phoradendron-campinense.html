                    <h1>Phoradendron campinense</h1>
<p>Phoradendron campinense, commonly known as the Campinas mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Viscaceae family.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus *Cecropia*, in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also deriving some photosynthetic ability from its own leaves. Its small, white or pale green berries contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of forest canopies.</p>
