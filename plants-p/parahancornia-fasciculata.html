                    <h1>Parahancornia fasciculata</h1>
<p>Parahancornia fasciculata, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often clustered together, forming a dense, shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Parahancornia fasciculata is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
