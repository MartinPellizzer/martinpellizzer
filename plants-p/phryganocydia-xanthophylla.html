                    <h1>Phryganocydia xanthophylla</h1>
<p>Phryganocydia xanthophylla, commonly known as the yellow-leafed ermine moth, is a species of moth belonging to the family Gelechiidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small size and distinctive yellowish coloration on its wings. The plant association of this species is primarily with certain species of grasses and sedges, where its larvae feed on the foliage. The botanical features of the plant are not directly related to the moth, as it is an insect rather than a plant.</p>
<p>However, the plant species it inhabits often have narrow, grass-like leaves and are found in moist, temperate environments.</p>
