The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is popular as a houseplant but should be handled with care as it is toxic to humans and pets.</p>
