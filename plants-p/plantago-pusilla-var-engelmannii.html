                    <h1>Plantago pusilla var. engelmannii</h1>
<p>Plantago pusilla var. engelmannii, commonly known as Engelmann's narrowleaf plantain, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and thrives in open, sunny environments such as prairies and rocky areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
