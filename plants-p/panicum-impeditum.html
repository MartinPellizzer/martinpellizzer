<p>Panicum impeditum, commonly known as the interrupted panicgrass, is a species of grass native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
