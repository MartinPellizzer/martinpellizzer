<p>Paraspalathus stellaris, commonly known as the star-spined spurge, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in fine, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its unique morphology and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and evolution.</p>
