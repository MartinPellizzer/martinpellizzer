                    <h1>Polypogon filiformis</h1>
<p>Polypogon filiformis, commonly known as the slender grass or threadgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Polypogon filiformis is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats.</p>
