<p>Parsonsia penangiana, commonly known as the Penang ghost orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parsonsia penangiana is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
