<p>Peperomia rubrimaculata, commonly known as the red-spotted peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>

The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that emerge from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Peperomia rubrimaculata is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ornamental foliage.</p>
