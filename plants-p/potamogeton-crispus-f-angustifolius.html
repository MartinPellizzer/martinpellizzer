                    <h1>Potamogeton crispus f. angustifolius</h1>
<p>Potamogeton crispus f. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It has slender, linear leaves that are typically narrower than the standard variety of Potamogeton crispus, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which emerge from the water surface. It thrives in slow-moving or still waters with muddy or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain aquatic ecosystems, altering habitat structure and affecting water quality.</p>
