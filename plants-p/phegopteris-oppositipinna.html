<p>Phegopteris oppositipinna, commonly known as the broad shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into two opposite pinnae, giving it its scientific name. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The broad shield fern is an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat.</p>
