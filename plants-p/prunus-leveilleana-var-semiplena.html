                    <h1>Prunus leveilleana var. semiplena</h1>
<p>Prunus leveilleana var. semiplena, commonly known as the partially double-flowered cherry, is a botanical variant of the Prunus leveilleana species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its semi-double flowers, which have a partially developed central pistil and multiple petals, giving it a more elaborate appearance than simple-flowered varieties. This plant is native to Southeast Asia and is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, edible fruits.</p>
<p>The botanical interest of this variety lies in its floral morphology and its potential use in horticultural breeding programs.</p>
