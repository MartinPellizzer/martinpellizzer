<p>Platanthera sigeyosii, commonly known as the Japanese twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with slender, grass-like leaves and a single, pale yellow or greenish flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
