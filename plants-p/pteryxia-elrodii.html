                    <h1>Pteryxia elrodii</h1>
<p>Pteryxia elrodii, commonly known as the Elrod's pterygia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, which features small, scale-like appendages that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered together, contributing to its overall compact appearance. Its growth habit is usually low and mat-forming, allowing it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pteryxia elrodii is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health.</p>
