                    <h1>Polycarpon tetraphyllum var. depauperatum</h1>
<p>Polycarpon tetraphyllum var. depauperatum, commonly known as the sparse-stemmed four-leaf knotweed, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the polycarpon genus.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean climate zones. The plant is characterized by its reduced foliage and compact growth habit, with small, narrow leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers. It thrives in rocky or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as cliffs and slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
