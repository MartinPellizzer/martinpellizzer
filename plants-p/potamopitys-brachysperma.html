                    <h1>Potamopitys brachysperma</h1>
<p>Potamopitys brachysperma, commonly known as the short-seeded mountain pine, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the high-altitude regions of central Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and evergreen foliage, with needle-like leaves that are densely packed on short shoots. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and ecologically important species.</p>
