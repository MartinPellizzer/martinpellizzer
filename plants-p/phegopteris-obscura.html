                    <h1>Phegopteris obscura</h1>
<p>Phegopteris obscura, commonly known as the common shield fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into small, shield-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous stolons, which help in vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
