<p>Phymatopteris crenatopinnata, commonly known as the crenate frond fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right humidity and light conditions.</p>
