                    <h1>Pseudogaltonia</h1>
<p>Pseudogaltonia, commonly known as the forest cycad, is a genus of cycads native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their tall, unbranched stems and large, feather-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. Pseudogaltonia species are evergreen and typically grow in humid, shaded environments within tropical and subtropical forests. They produce cones rather than flowers, and their reproductive structures are separate, with male and female cones on different plants.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, many species of Pseudogaltonia are threatened with extinction.</p>
