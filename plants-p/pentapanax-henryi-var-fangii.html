                    <h1>Pentapanax henryi var. fangii</h1>
<p>Pentapanax henryi var. fangii, commonly known as the Fang's five-leaf plant, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Araliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in southern China, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive compound leaves, which typically consist of five elongated, lance-shaped leaflets. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, and it produces berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
