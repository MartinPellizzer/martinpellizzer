<p>Pagameopsis maguirei, commonly known as the Maguire's pagamea, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of the United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in rocky woodlands. Its flowers, which are small and white, appear in umbel-like clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pagameopsis maguirei is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
