<p>Phelypaea cedreti, commonly known as the cedrela fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Phelypaea cedreti is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to add a lush, green element to shaded gardens.</p>
