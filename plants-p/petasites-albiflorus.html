<p>Petasites albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, cool environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Petasites albiflorus plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
