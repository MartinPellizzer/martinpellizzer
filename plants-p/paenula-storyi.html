                    <h1>Paenula storyi</h1>
<p>Paenula storyi, commonly known as the Story's paenula, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, often in late spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Paenula storyi is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
