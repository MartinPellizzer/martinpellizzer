<p>Phymatodes swartzii, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, orbicular leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Phymatodes swartzii plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and provides nectar for pollinators.</p>
