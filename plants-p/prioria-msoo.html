<p>Prioria msoo, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, white flowers that are followed by capsule fruits.</p>
<p>Due to overexploitation, Prioria msoo is now listed as endangered in many regions.</p>
