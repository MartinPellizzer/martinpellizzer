<p>Plagiobothrys nothofulvus is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the evening primrose family and is known for its distinctive yellow-orange blooms. This species is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered by some conservation organizations. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it an important subject for botanical study.</p>
