<p>Polygala lecardii, commonly known as the laceflower or lecard's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often pink or purple flowers that resemble small, intricate lace patterns. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils. Its leaves are usually small and narrow, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Polygala lecardii is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
