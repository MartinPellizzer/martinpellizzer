<p>Phyllodes flexuosa, commonly known as the warty phyllodinea, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Phyllodes, which is part of the legume family, Fabaceae. The plant is characterized by its unique, flattened, leaf-like structures called phyllodes, which are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. These phyllodes are typically narrow and curling, adapting to the harsh, dry environment.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds.</p>
