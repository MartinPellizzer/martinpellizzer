<p>Phoradendron martinicense, commonly known as the Martinique mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, glossy green leaves and white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer. Its berries, which are dark red and fleshy, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological role and unique biology, it is a significant species in the ecosystems where it grows.</p>
