                    <h1>Pleopeltis caudiformis</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis caudiformis, commonly known as the long-leaf rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
