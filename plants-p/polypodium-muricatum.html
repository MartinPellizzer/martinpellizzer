<p>Polypodium muricatum, commonly known as the "velvet fern," is a fern species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are covered in tiny, raised spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its unique appearance and ability to form dense colonies make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically dark green with a velvety texture, contributing to its common name.</p>
