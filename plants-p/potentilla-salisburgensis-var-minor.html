<p>Potentilla salisburgensis var. minor, commonly known as the Salzburg dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, five-petaled white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, adding delicate beauty to rocky slopes and meadows. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions and is often found in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
