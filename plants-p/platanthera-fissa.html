<p>Platanthera fissa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and its long, spiraled inflorescence of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Platanthera fissa is known for its ephemeral blooming period, often appearing briefly in early summer.</p>
