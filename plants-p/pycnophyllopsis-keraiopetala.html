                    <h1>Pycnophyllopsis keraiopetala</h1>
<p>Pycnophyllopsis keraiopetala, commonly known as the keraiopetala fern, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered fronds that form a compact rosette structure, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. The plant produces small, delicate spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided, feather-like appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Pycnophyllopsis keraiopetala is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed, humid environments.</p>
