                    <h1>Pholistoma</h1>
<p>Pholistoma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender roots and produces delicate, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often mistaken for foliage of other plants.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
