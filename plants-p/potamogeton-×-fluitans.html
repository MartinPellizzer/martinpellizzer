                    <h1>Potamogeton × fluitans</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × fluitans, commonly known as the floating pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant that combines traits from its parent species, Potamogeton perfoliatus and Potamogeton praelatus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating, strap-like leaves that are often partially submerged, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, and it reproduces both sexually and vegetatively through rhizomes. Potamogeton × fluitans plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential can lead to dense growth that outcompetes native species in some regions.</p>
