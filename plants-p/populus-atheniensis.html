<p>Populus atheniensis, commonly known as the Athens poplar, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the region of Attica in Greece.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, pendulous catkins. The tree typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Populus atheniensis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
