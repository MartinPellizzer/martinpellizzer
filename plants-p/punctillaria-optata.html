<p>Punctillaria optata, commonly known as the star-shaped liverwort, is a small, aquatic liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, star-like thallus that typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments. The plant has a flattened, ribbon-like structure with a central axis and radiating lobes, giving it its distinctive appearance. It is often found on submerged rocks or in wet soil near streams and ponds.</p>
<p>Punctillaria optata plays a minor but ecologically significant role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
