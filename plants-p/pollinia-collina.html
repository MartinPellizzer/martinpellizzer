                    <h1>Pollinia collina</h1>
<p>Pollinia collina, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, showy flowers that are often pale purple or white in color. The plant produces specialized pollination structures called pollinia, which are clustered and attached to a stalk, facilitating unique pollination mechanisms. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
