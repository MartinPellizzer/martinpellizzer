<p>Prunus domestica subsp.</p>
<p>cyclopetala, commonly known as the cyclopetal pear, is a subspecies of the European pear characterized by its unique floral morphology. It features a distinctive flower structure with a cyclopetal arrangement, where the petals are arranged in a spiral rather than a typical radial pattern.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to the Balkan Peninsula and parts of Turkey, thriving in temperate climates. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are typically not cultivated for consumption but are of interest in botanical studies.</p>
<p>Its floral characteristics make it a subject of research in plant evolution and pollination biology.</p>
