<p>Pinus laricio subsp.</p>
<p>leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaved stone pine, is a rare and relict species native to the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of other pine species.</p>
<p>The tree produces cones that are often pendulous and can remain on the branches for several years. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, mountainous environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
