                    <h1>Pinus sinensis var. yunnanensis</h1>
<p>Pinus sinensis var. yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan red pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reddish-brown bark and slender, pyramidal crown, with needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The plant produces cones that are initially green and later turn brown, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often growing in forested areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
