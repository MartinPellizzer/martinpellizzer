                    <h1>Phoradendron spathulifolium</h1>
<p>Phoradendron spathulifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and has a distinctive appearance with broad, ovate leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds to new host trees.</p>
<p>Its growth is dependent on both sunlight and the nutrients it extracts from its host, making it an important component of forest ecosystems.</p>
