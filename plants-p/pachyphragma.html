                    <h1>Pachyphragma</h1>
<p>Pachyphragma, commonly known as the elephant's foot, is a unique succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, and often branched stems that resemble the legs of an elephant, hence its common name. The plant produces small, pale green or yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in summer. Its leaves are usually small and scale-like, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Pachyphragma is well adapted to dry conditions, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
