<p>Paspalum phaeotrichum, commonly known as the silverhair grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades and tufted inflorescences, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist or wetland habitats, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Paspalum phaeotrichum is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects.</p>
