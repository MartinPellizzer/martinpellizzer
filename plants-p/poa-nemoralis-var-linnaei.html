<p>Poa nemoralis var. linnaei, commonly known as the Linnaean bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which produces small, two-lobed spikelets with pale yellow to greenish flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
