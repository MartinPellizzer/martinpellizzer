                    <h1>Poa pagophila</h1>
<p>Poa pagophila, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Poa pagophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife.</p>
