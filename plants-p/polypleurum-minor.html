<p>Polypleurum minor, commonly known as the small-leafed marsh fern, is a small, aquatic fern native to wetland habitats in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense, mat-like colonies. The plant has slender, branching fronds with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky coating. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland environment.</p>
