                    <h1>Pityrogramma × nicaraguensis</h1>
<p>Pityrogramma × nicaraguensis, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a member of the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is a fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant exhibits a unique combination of traits from its parent species, Pityrogramma calomelanos and Pityrogramma mirabilis. Its fronds are bi-pinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and they are often used in horticultural settings for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid environments.</p>
