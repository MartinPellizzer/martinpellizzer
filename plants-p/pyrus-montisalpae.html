                    <h1>Pyrus montisalpae</h1>
<p>Pyrus montisalpae, commonly known as the Montisalpe pear, is a rare and ancient species of pear native to the Alps.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elongated fruit with a thin, edible skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, while its flowers are white and clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to climate change, Pyrus montisalpae is considered a botanically significant and conservationally important species.</p>
