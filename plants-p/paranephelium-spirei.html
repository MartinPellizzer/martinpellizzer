                    <h1>Paranephelium spirei</h1>
<p>Paranephelium spirei, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a rare and unique species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices in tropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a feature common among many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Paranephelium spirei is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed, moist microhabitats.</p>
