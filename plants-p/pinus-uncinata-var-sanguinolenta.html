                    <h1>Pinus uncinata var. sanguinolenta</h1>
<p>Pinus uncinata var. sanguinolenta, commonly known as the crimson pine, is a rare and striking variant of the serpentine pine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid red needles, which contrast sharply with its dark bark and conical shape. This variety is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, rocky soils, often found in mountainous regions. The plant's foliage and cones exhibit unique coloration due to genetic mutations affecting pigment production.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
