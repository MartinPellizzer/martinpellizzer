<p>Pinus fenzeliana subsp.</p>
<p>varifolia, commonly known as the Fenzel's pine, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and conical shape, typical of many pine species.</p>
<p>The leaves are needle-like, typically arranged in bundles of two, and exhibit a distinctive variation in foliage, hence its subspecies name *varifolia*. The cones are woody and produce edible seeds, which are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological traits.</p>
