                    <h1>Poa tenuiflora</h1>
<p>Poa tenuiflora, commonly known as slender-flowered bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with fine, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to white flowers, which are characteristic of the Poa genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
