<p>Pinanga insignis subsp.</p>
<p>loheriana, commonly known as the Loher's bamboo palm, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, clustered growth habit and elongated, pinnately compound leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it thrives in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its small, clustered inflorescences produce yellowish-white flowers, followed by dark, berry-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
