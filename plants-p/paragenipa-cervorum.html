                    <h1>Paragenipa cervorum</h1>
<p>Paragenipa cervorum, commonly known as the forest fern, is a tropical plant native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its rhizome system allows it to spread slowly through the forest floor, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Paragenipa cervorum plays a vital role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to the forest's biodiversity.</p>
