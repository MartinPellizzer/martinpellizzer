                    <h1>Pronephrium asperum</h1>
<p>Pronephrium asperum, commonly known as the rough bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in tropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant's leaves are usually submerged, while its stems may float on the water surface. Its unique botanical features include small, hair-like structures that aid in capturing prey.</p>
<p>Pronephrium asperum is adapted to nutrient-poor environments, relying on its carnivorous diet for essential nutrients.</p>
