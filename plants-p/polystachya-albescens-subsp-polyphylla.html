<p>Polystachya albescens subsp.</p>
<p>polyphylla, commonly known as the white-veined bamboo orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, bamboo-like stems and large, pale green leaves with prominent white veins.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
