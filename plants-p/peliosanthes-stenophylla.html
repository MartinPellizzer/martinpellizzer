                    <h1>Peliosanthes stenophylla</h1>
<p>Peliosanthes stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnate leaves that are narrow and stiff. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
