<p>Pachystroma ilicifolium var. heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable holly-leaf pachystroma, is a rare and distinctive shrub native to specific regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with leaves that vary in shape and size, ranging from narrow, holly-like leaves to broader, more rounded ones. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a unique addition to specialized gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
