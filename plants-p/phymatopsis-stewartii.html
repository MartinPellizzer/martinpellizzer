<p>Phymatopsis stewartii, commonly known as the Stewart's phymatopsis, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Phymatopsis stewartii is an important component of desert ecosystems, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various insect species.</p>
