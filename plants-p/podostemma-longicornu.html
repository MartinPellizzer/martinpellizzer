<p>Podostemma longicornu, commonly known as the longhorn podostem, is a rare aquatic plant found in fast-flowing streams and rivers.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ribbon-like leaves that are adapted to the turbulent water environment. The plant has a unique reproductive system, with its flowers being pollinated by insects and its seeds dispersed by water. It thrives in nutrient-rich, rocky substrates and requires clear, oxygenated water for survival.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered an indicator species for pristine aquatic ecosystems.</p>
