<p>Podanthum canescens subsp.</p>
<p>rhodopeum, commonly known as the Rhodopean sandwort, is a perennial herb native to the Rhodope Mountains in Bulgaria. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, white to pale pink flowers.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sandy or calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
