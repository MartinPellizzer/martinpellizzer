<p>Prosopis pugionata, commonly known as the smallleaf mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, compound leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, followed by small, woody pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Prosopis pugionata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
