<p>Poa tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan grass, is a species of grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of its habitat. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, allowing it to colonize remote and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Poa tibetica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for local wildlife.</p>
