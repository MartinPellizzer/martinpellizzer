                    <h1>Primula crassifolia</h1>
<p>Primula crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
