<p>Plantago subulata proles insularis, commonly known as the island narrowleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to certain island regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the Plantaginaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
