<p>Psidium umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that provide dense shade, hence its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. Its botanical features include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a preference for humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Psidium umbrosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits in warm climates.</p>
