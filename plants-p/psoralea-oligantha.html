<p>Psoralea oligantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved psoralea, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 10â€“30 centimeters and has slender, hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
