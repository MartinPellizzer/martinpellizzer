<p>Pinus uncinata, commonly known as the Spanish fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically shorter and more curved compared to those of other pine species. The tree produces cones that are often pendulous, with scales that open to release seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>The bark of Pinus uncinata is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh climatic conditions.</p>
