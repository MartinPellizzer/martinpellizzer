                    <h1>Polypodium pectinatum var. baezanum</h1>
<p>Polypodium pectinatum var. baezanum, commonly known as the Baezan holly fern, is a variant of the polypody fern native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are often dark green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
