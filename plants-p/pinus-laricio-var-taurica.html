                    <h1>Pinus laricio var. taurica</h1>
<p>Pinus laricio var. taurica, commonly known as the Crimean fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the Crimean Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a variant of the Laricio fir, characterized by its unique morphological features and limited distribution. The plant exhibits needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid compared to its parent species. It produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and environmental threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
