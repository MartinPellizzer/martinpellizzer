                    <h1>Polypodium intermedium var. cambricoides</h1>
<p>Polypodium intermedium var. cambricoides, commonly known as the Cambridgeshire polypody, is a fern native to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20â€“40 cm long. The plant prefers shaded, moist habitats such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in two rows along the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its slightly broader and more robust fronds compared to the typical form of *Polypodium intermedium*.</p>
