                    <h1>Picea brachytyla var. ascendens</h1>
<p>Picea brachytyla var. ascendens, commonly known as the Sitka spruce, is a tall evergreen conifer native to the coastal regions of Southeast Alaska and western Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving cones and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in coastal environments with high humidity and frequent rainfall. It plays a vital role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat for various wildlife species and contributing to the local biodiversity.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more upright growth habit compared to the typical form of Picea brachytyla.</p>
