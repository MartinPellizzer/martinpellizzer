                    <h1>Pistia stratiotes var. linguiformis</h1>
<p>Pistia stratiotes var. linguiformis, commonly known as the broadleaf water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are usually green with a waxy coating, allowing it to float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and canals.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native habitats, impacting water quality and native plant life.</p>
