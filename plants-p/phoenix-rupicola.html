                    <h1>Phoenix rupicola</h1>
<p>Phoenix rupicola, commonly known as the rock date palm, is a species of palm native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed trunk and narrow, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible dates, though these are not as widely cultivated as those of other date palms. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and coastal environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>
