                    <h1>Parnassia gansuensis</h1>
<p>Parnassia gansuensis, commonly known as the Gansu parnassia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Gansu Province in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and mountain meadows. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parnassia gansuensis is considered an endangered species.</p>
