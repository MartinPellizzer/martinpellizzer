<p>Pinus dalatensis subsp.</p>
<p>bidoupensis, commonly known as the Bidoup Pine, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. It is a coniferous evergreen tree that typically grows in high-altitude montane forests.</p>
<p>The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in bundles of five, characteristic of the pine genus. Its cones are woody and contain two-winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
