                    <h1>Pityrogramma leptophylla</h1>
<p>Pityrogramma leptophylla, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pityrogrammaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under forest canopies or near streams. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>The slender shield fern is notable for its simple, elegant morphology and its role in understory ecosystems.</p>
