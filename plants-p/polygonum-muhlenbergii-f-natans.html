<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats on the water surface. The leaves are typically heart-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and appear in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in wetland environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams.</p>
