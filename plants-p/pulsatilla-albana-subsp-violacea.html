<p>Pulsatilla albana subsp.</p>
<p>violacea, commonly known as the violet pasqueflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May.</p>
<p>The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are hairy and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are composed of numerous petal-like sepals and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
