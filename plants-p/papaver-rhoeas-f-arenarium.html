                    <h1>Papaver rhoeas f. arenarium</h1>
<p>Papaver rhoeas f. arenarium, commonly known as the sand poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its adaptation to sandy soils.</p>
<p>This form exhibits smaller, more compact growth compared to the typical Papaver rhoeas, with pale yellow to orange flowers. The leaves are often more hairy and have a shorter stature, aiding in its survival in arid environments. It is typically found in disturbed soils and coastal areas where sand and gravel dominate.</p>
<p>This botanical feature makes it a resilient and distinctive member of the Papaver genus.</p>
