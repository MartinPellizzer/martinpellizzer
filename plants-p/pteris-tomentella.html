                    <h1>Pteris tomentella</h1>
<p>Pteris tomentella, commonly known as the hairy water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and often form dense mats, which help in stabilizing the soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
