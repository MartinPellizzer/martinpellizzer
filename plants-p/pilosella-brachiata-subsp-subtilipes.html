<p>Pilosella brachiata subsp.</p>
<p>subtilipes, commonly known as the slender pilosella, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typical sunflower-like appearance.</p>
<p>The plant features finely hairy stems and leaves, with small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, often growing in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Its subspecies distinction is based on subtle differences in leaf morphology and hair density compared to other Pilosella species.</p>
