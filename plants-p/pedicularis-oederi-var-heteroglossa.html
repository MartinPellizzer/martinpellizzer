                    <h1>Pedicularis oederi var. heteroglossa</h1>
<p>Pedicularis oederi var. heteroglossa, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its haustoria. The plant features delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with contrasting lip petals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
