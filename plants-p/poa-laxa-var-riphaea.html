                    <h1>Poa laxa var. riphaea</h1>
<p>Poa laxa var. riphaea, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, alpine environments and is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a bluish-green hue, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Poa laxa var. riphaea is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
