                    <h1>Periploca capsularis</h1>
<p>Periploca capsularis, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in arid environments.</p>
