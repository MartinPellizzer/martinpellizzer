                    <h1>Pumilo</h1>
<p>Pumilo, commonly known as the desert rose, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, often blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically small and triangular, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Pumilo is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal water once established.</p>
