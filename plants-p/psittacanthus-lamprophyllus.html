<p>Psittacanthus lamprophyllus, commonly known as the golden-leaf hala.</p>
<p>It is a species of cycad native to the Caribbean, characterized by its distinctive, palm-like appearance and its ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk with a fibrous, spongy outer layer, and its leaves are large, pinnate, and often have a striking golden or variegated coloration. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by insects, followed by the development of hard, woody seed pods.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts aim to protect its natural habitat from degradation.</p>
