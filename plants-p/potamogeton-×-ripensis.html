<p>Potamogeton × ripensis, commonly known as the hybrid water milfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Potamogeton crispus and Potamogeton praelongus, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often ribbed and can be found in dense stands in shallow to moderately deep water. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>However, it can also become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
