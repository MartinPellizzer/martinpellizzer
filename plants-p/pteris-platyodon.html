                    <h1>Pteris platyodon</h1>
<p>Pteris platyodon, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or near water sources. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to wet soil or rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The broad, lance-shaped leaves contribute to its ornamental appeal, making it a popular choice for aquatic and terrarium settings.</p>
