<p>Psydaranta, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, erect stalks rising from the water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for various aquatic life. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water while anchoring the plant in place.</p>
