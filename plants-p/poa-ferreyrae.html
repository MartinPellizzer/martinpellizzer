<p>Poa ferreyrae, commonly known as the Ferreyra's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on the ground, often found in moist, temperate environments such as meadows and grasslands. The plant has slender, hairless stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Poa ferreyrae is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in native habitats.</p>
