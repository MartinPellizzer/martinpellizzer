                    <h1>Pedicularis dubia</h1>
<p>Pedicularis dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. Native to the alpine regions of Europe, it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with a unique, spurred shape that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
