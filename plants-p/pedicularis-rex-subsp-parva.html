<p>Pedicularis rex subsp.</p>
<p>parva, commonly known as the dwarf crownfire lousewort, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on the roots of other plants for some of its nutrients.</p>
<p>Native to the high alpine regions of the European Alps, it thrives in cool, moist environments at elevations above 2,000 meters. The plant produces striking red-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded structure, which attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
