                    <h1>Pachystoma angustifolium</h1>
<p>Pachystoma angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, usually during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
