<p>Panicum miliaceum convar. contractum, commonly known as proso millet, is an annual grass native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it is often cultivated for its high nutritional value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>Proso millet is also valued for its role in sustainable agriculture due to its low water requirements and ability to grow in poor soils.</p>
