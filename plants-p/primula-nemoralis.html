<p>Primula nemoralis, commonly known as the wood anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to temperate regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of heart-shaped, lobed leaves and produces clusters of delicate, white, five-petaled flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in woodland habitats, preferring moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies, contributing to its role in early season pollination networks.</p>
<p>The species is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in suitable environments.</p>
