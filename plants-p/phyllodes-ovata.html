                    <h1>Phyllodes ovata</h1>
<p>Phyllodes ovata, commonly known as the silky wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow, and often silky-haired phyllodes, which are modified leaves that serve as the primary photosynthetic structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Phyllodes ovata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it an important component of native Australian flora.</p>
