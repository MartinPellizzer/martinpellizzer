<p>Potamogeton berchtoldii subsp.</p>
<p>clystocarpus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide, with a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, often submerged or just at the water's surface. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which can help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in slow-moving waters such as lakes, ponds, and streams.</p>
