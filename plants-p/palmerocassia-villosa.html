<p>Palmerocassia villosa, commonly known as the hairy palmerocassia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in soft, hairy foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by winged pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Palmerocassia villosa is a drought-tolerant species, making it well adapted to semi-arid and arid climates.</p>
