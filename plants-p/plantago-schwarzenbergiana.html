                    <h1>Plantago schwarzenbergiana</h1>
<p>Plantago schwarzenbergiana, commonly known as the velvetleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to Central and Southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along streambanks.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in damp, temperate regions.</p>
