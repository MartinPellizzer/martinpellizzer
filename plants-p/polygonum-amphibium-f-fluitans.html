                    <h1>Polygonum amphibium f. fluitans</h1>
<p>Polygonum amphibium f. fluitans, commonly known as the floating plantain, is a variant of the common plantain that exhibits aquatic adaptations.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, allowing it to remain buoyant on water surfaces. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands, where it can access sunlight for photosynthesis. Its stems are flexible and often root at the nodes, enabling it to spread across water surfaces.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters, and are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
