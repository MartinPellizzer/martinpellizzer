<p>Phyllitis delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's water fern, is a rare aquatic fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and pollution, Phyllitis delavayi is considered endangered and is protected in several regions.</p>
