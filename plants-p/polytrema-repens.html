                    <h1>Polytrema repens</h1>
<p>Polytrema repens, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or saturated soils, often forming dense mats along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively through rhizomes. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikes and are pollinated by wind, contributing to its success in aquatic environments.</p>
