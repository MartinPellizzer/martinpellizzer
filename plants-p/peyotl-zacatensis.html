                    <h1>Peyotl zacatensis</h1>
<p>Peyotl zacatensis, commonly known as the Zacatechol plant, is a species of cactus native to the highlands of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant contains mescaline, a psychoactive alkaloid, which has been used traditionally by indigenous communities for ceremonial and medicinal purposes. Peyotl zacatensis thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils at elevations above 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it distinct from other peyote species, and it plays a significant role in both cultural and ecological contexts.</p>
