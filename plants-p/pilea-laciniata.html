                    <h1>Pilea laciniata</h1>
<p>Pilea laciniata, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive, almost sculptural appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Pilea laciniata is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
