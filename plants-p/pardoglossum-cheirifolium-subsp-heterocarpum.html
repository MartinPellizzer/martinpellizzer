<p>Pardoglossum cheirifolium subsp.</p>
<p>heterocarpum, commonly known as the Moroccan leafy orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to North Africa. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, with broad, fleshy leaves that are adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions for successful growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
