                    <h1>Pentaphragma scortechinii var. flocculosum</h1>
<p>Pentaphragma scortechinii var. flocculosum, commonly known as the fluffcap or flocculate lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly growth that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The thallus is typically pale to yellowish in color and is covered with a thick layer of soredia, which are small, powdery structures containing reproductive cells. This lichen is often found on tree bark, especially in temperate forest environments, where it thrives on the surface of decaying wood.</p>
<p>Its morphology and chemical composition make it an important indicator species for assessing air quality and ecological health.</p>
