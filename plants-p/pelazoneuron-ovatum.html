                    <h1>Pelazoneuron ovatum</h1>
<p>Pelazoneuron ovatum, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in a fine layer of golden hairs, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in high humidity and partial shade, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically developing on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Pelazoneuron ovatum is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
