                    <h1>Pederlea</h1>
<p>Pederlea, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are bi-lobed and remain green throughout the year, providing year-round foliage.</p>
<p>Pederlea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens.</p>
