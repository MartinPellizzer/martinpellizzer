<p>Periphanes spiralis, commonly known as the spiral tamarisk, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small and scale-like, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The spiral tamarisk is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
