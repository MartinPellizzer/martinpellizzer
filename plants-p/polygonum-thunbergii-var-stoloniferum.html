                    <h1>Polygonum thunbergii var. stoloniferum</h1>
<p>Polygonum thunbergii var. stoloniferum, commonly known as the creeping knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively through stolons and rhizomes. The plant typically has heart-shaped, glossy leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or red. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both an ecological pioneer and a potential invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
