                    <h1>Parrya golenkinii</h1>
<p>Parrya golenkinii, commonly known as the Golenkin's parrya, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms a low-growing mat with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It blooms in late spring or early summer, producing clusters of flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parrya golenkinii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
