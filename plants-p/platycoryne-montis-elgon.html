<p>Platycoryne montis-elgon, commonly known as the Elgon wax tree, is a shrub native to the highlands of East Africa, particularly around Mount Elgon.</p>

It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
