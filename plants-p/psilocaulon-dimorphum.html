                    <h1>Psilocaulon dimorphum</h1>
<p>Psilocaulon dimorphum, commonly known as the two-form coralplant, is a unique halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its branching, coral-like appearance. The plant exhibits dimorphism, with distinct morphological differences between its stems and leaves. It thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Its structure and adaptations make it an important species in ecological studies of salt-tolerant flora.</p>
