                    <h1>Polystichum horridipinnum</h1>
<p>Polystichum horridipinnum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are densely covered with fine, hairy scales, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients effectively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a compact, shield-like structure.</p>
