<p>Polypodium conterminans, commonly known as the Appalachian sword fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Polypodium conterminans is often found in association with other epiphytic and terrestrial ferns in humid, temperate climates.</p>
