                    <h1>Panicum proximum</h1>
<p>Panicum proximum, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in open fields and disturbed areas. Its botanical features include narrow, parallel-veined leaves and a compact growth pattern that helps it conserve water.</p>
<p>Panicum proximum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
