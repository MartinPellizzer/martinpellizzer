<p>Polypodium secundum, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its wiry, climbing stems and its ability to attach itself to trees and other structures. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, often arching growth habit. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
