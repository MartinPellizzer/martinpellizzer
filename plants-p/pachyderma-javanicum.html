                    <h1>Pachyderma javanicum</h1>
<p>Pachyderma javanicum, commonly known as the Java sponge or sea sponge, is a marine organism belonging to the class Hexactinellida.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its porous, sponge-like structure composed of silica-based spicules that provide structural support. This species is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates. Its unique morphology allows it to filter feed by capturing plankton from the surrounding water.</p>
<p>Pachyderma javanicum plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for smaller marine organisms.</p>
