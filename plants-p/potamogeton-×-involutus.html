                    <h1>Potamogeton × involutus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × involutus, commonly known as the curled pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant that exhibits unique morphological characteristics.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Potamogeton perfoliatus and Potamogeton crispus, resulting in a blend of traits from both parent species. The plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are often curled or twisted, which distinguishes it from its parental species.</p>
<p>This feature aids in its identification and is an adaptation that may help it thrive in certain aquatic environments.</p>
