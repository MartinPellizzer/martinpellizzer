<p>Panicum phragmites, commonly known as common reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous growth and tall, cylindrical spikes of small, greenish-brown flowers. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often coated with a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its rhizomes spread extensively, forming dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Panicum phragmites plays an important ecological role in wetlands by filtering water and preventing erosion.</p>
