                    <h1>Phlebodium serpens</h1>
<p>Phlebodium serpens, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, tree-like fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag, giving it its common name. The plant lacks true roots and instead uses its rhizomes to anchor itself to trees or rocks. Its leaves are thick and leathery, often forming a dense, umbrella-like structure.</p>
<p>Phlebodium serpens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular in horticulture for its ornamental appearance.</p>
