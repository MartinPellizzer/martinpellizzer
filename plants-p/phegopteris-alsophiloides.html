                    <h1>Phegopteris alsophiloides</h1>
<p>Phegopteris alsophiloides, commonly known as the western sword fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its finely divided, sword-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky stream banks, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and establish itself in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
