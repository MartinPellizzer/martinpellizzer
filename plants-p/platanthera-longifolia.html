                    <h1>Platanthera longifolia</h1>
<p>Platanthera longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features a slender, often reddish stem that supports a cluster of elongated, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged in a rosette at the base. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in many regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
