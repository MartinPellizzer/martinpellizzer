                    <h1>Petrocosmea pubescens</h1>
<p>Petrocosmea pubescens, commonly known as the hairy petrocosmea, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, are adapted for pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Petrocosmea pubescens is considered a conservation concern.</p>
