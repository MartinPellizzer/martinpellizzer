<p>Pteretis nodulosa f. obtusilobata, commonly known as the blunt-lobed pteretis, is a unique variant of the pteretis genus.</p>

The plant is a perennial herb native to specific regions in New Zealand, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
