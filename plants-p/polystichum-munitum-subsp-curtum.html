<p>Polystichum munitum subsp.</p>
<p>curtum, commonly known as the Pacific silver fern, is a fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white underside on the fronds, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
