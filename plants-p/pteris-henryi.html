<p>Pteris henryi, commonly known as the Henry's water fern, is a species of fern native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Pteris henryi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
