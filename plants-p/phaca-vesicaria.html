<p>Phaca vesicaria, commonly known as the bladder wort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that help it float on the water surface. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are small and scale-like, while the bladders are specialized for gas exchange and buoyancy.</p>
<p>Phaca vesicaria plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
