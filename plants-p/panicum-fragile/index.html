                            <h1>Panicum Fragile</h1>
<p>Panicum fragile is a delicate grass species known for its lightweight and easily broken stems. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments where water is scarce. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides due to its adaptability. Its small, narrow leaves and inconspicuous flowers make it easy to overlook. Despite its fragile appearance, it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
