                    <h1>Platystele pygmaea</h1>
<p>Platystele pygmaea, commonly known as the miniature ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and lack of visible stems. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are often hidden among the foliage, making it difficult to spot. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Platystele pygmaea is considered endangered.</p>
