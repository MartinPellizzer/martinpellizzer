                    <h1>Plutea</h1>
<p>Plutea, commonly known as the sea lettuce, is a type of green algae that belongs to the order Ulvales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, sheet-like structure that can range in color from bright green to a darker emerald hue. Plutea thrives in marine environments, often found in tidal zones and along rocky coastlines. The plant reproduces through the release of motile spores into the water, which then develop into new colonies.</p>
<p>Its simple yet efficient structure allows it to efficiently absorb nutrients from the surrounding seawater.</p>
