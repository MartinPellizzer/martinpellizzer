                    <h1>Potentilla sinonivea</h1>
<p>Potentilla sinonivea, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight and helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are adapted to retain moisture in rocky, well-drained soils, and it is often found in alpine meadows and slopes.</p>
<p>Potentilla sinonivea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
