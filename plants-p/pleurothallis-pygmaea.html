                    <h1>Pleurothallis pygmaea</h1>
<p>Pleurothallis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf pleurothallis, is a small orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its miniature size, typically growing no taller than a few centimeters, and its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapting to its epiphytic lifestyle by clinging to tree bark.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts seeking compact, ornamental specimens.</p>
