<p>Poa annua var. viridis, commonly known as green annual bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, golf courses, and disturbed areas. It has a short rhizome system and produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is both a desirable turfgrass and a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
