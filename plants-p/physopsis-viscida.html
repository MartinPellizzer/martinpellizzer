                    <h1>Physopsis viscida</h1>
<p>Physopsis viscida, commonly known as the sticky physopsis, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that often exude a sticky substance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are attractive to birds and mammals. Its unique morphology and adaptations to humid, shaded environments make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
<p>The sticky secretions may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and pathogens.</p>
