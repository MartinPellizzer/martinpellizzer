<p>Pseudocystopteris spinulosa, commonly known as the spinulose water fern, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in tiny, spiny structures called spinules. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Pseudocystopteris spinulosa is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
