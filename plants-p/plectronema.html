<p>Plectronema, commonly known as the "velvet fern," is a unique plant belonging to the family Pterobryaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that give it a soft, moss-like appearance. The plant is often found in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, contain spores that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Plectronema plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
