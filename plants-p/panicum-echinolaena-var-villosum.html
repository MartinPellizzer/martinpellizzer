                    <h1>Panicum echinolaena var. villosum</h1>
<p>Panicum echinolaena var. villosum, commonly known as hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps stabilize soil in arid environments. The plant produces spikelets that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ability to regenerate quickly make it an important component of semi-arid ecosystems.</p>
