                    <h1>Prescottia colorans var. macrophylla</h1>
<p>Prescottia colorans var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leafed Prescotia, is a striking member of the Gesneriaceae family native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range from orange to red, often with contrasting yellow throats. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are larger than the standard variety, giving it a more dramatic appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variant is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
