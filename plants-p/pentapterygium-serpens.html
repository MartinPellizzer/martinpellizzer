                    <h1>Pentapterygium serpens</h1>
<p>Pentapterygium serpens, commonly known as the serpentine pentapterygium, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiral-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, a trait common in serpentine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
