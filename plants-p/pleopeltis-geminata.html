                    <h1>Pleopeltis geminata</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis geminata, commonly known as the twin-veined fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that often exhibit a distinctive bifurcation in the midrib, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of forests. Its rhizomes are short and thick, anchoring it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a lush, green appearance throughout the year.</p>
