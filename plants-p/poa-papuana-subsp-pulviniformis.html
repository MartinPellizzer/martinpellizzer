<p>Poa papuana subsp.</p>
<p>pulviniformis, commonly known as the New Zealand mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy leaves that are adapted to cold and windy environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to violet flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in open, rocky habitats at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to the harsh conditions of its native range.</p>
