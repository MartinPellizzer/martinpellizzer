<p>Picea brachytyla subsp.</p>
<p>complanata, commonly known as the flat-needle white spruce, is a subspecies of the white spruce native to western North America. It is characterized by its flattened, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical white spruce.</p>
<p>The tree grows in coniferous forests, often in mountainous regions with cold climates. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts.</p>
