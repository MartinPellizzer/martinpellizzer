                    <h1>Piptochaetium depressum</h1>
<p>Piptochaetium depressum, commonly known as the flatgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, with narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, pale brown flowers, which are adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. It is well-suited for erosion control due to its extensive root system and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Piptochaetium depressum is also valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
