                    <h1>Pinus pawlikowskiana</h1>
<p>Pinus pawlikowskiana, commonly known as the Pawlikowski's pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles and distinctive, elongated cones. The tree typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in areas with high altitude and moderate rainfall. Its cones are woody and often remain attached to the branches for several years before opening.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
