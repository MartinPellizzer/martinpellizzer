<p>Phegopteris punctata, commonly known as the veined water fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive veining pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
