<p>Polypodium phyllitidis f. minus, commonly known as the small-leaf wall fern, is a rare and diminutive fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, densely packed fronds that are typically shorter and narrower than those of the typical form. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rock faces or in shaded forest undergrowth. Its fronds are usually leathery and have a dark green color with a glossy appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
