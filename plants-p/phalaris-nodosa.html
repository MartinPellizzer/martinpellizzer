                    <h1>Phalaris nodosa</h1>
<p>Phalaris nodosa, commonly known as the nodding grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along riverbanks. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear spike-like inflorescences with small, greenish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces distinctive nodules on its roots, which can host nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
<p>Phalaris nodosa is valued for its ecological role in supporting insect populations and its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
