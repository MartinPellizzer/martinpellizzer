The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the wet season. It is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
