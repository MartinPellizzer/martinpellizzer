                    <h1>Psorothamnus arborescens var. arborescens</h1>
<p>Psorothamnus arborescens var. arborescens, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, often blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
