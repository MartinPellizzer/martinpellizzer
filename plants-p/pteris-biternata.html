<p>Pteris biternata, commonly known as the three-part maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching and feathery in appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Pteris biternata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
