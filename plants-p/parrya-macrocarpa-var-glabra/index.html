                            <h1>Parrya Macrocarpa Var. Glabra</h1>
<p>Smooth parrya, scientifically known as Parrya macrocarpa var. glabra, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and striking yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. This variety of parrya is often found in rocky habitats and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike. Understanding its ecology and conservation status is crucial for preserving this botanical gem.</p>
