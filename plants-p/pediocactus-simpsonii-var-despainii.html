                    <h1>Pediocactus simpsonii var. despainii</h1>
<p>Pediocactus simpsonii var. despainii, commonly known as the Desert Ghost Cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the deserts of Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a dramatic contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure, making it a challenging but rewarding plant for experienced growers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
