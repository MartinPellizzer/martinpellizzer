<p>Polygonum crispatum, commonly known as the curly dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, wavy-edged leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by reddish-brown seeds. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its extensive root system allows it to spread readily and become a common weed in agricultural settings.</p>
