                    <h1>Pistacia badghysi</h1>
<p>Pistacia badghysi, commonly known as the Persian pistachio, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Iran and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cashews and mangoes. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by woody, spiny fruits. The fruit contains a single seed enclosed in a hard, inedible shell, which is typically cracked open to reveal the edible kernel.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, Pistacia badghysi is considered a rare and valuable species in its native habitat.</p>
