                    <h1>Pleurothallis discophylla</h1>
<p>Pleurothallis discophylla, commonly known as the disk-leaf orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a small epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees, relying on its host for support rather than deriving nutrients from it. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered closely together, forming a dense rosette. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale yellow, arranged in a spike that can produce multiple blooms.</p>
<p>Pleurothallis discophylla is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
