                    <h1>Pelexia ventricosa</h1>
<p>Pelexia ventricosa, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, such as insects and crustaceans. The plant's leaves are often submerged, while its stems may extend above the water surface. It thrives in nutrient-poor habitats by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
