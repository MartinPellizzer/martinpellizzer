<p>Pneumatopteris micropaleata, commonly known as the small-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern characterized by its delicate, floating fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. The plant has a rhizome that anchors it to submerged substrates, and its fronds are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments.</p>
<p>Pneumatopteris micropaleata thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
