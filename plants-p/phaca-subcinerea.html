<p>Phaca subcinerea, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, white hairs that reflect light and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Phaca subcinerea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots and creeping growth habit make it a hardy and resilient species.</p>
