<p>Pteris sotae, commonly known as the Sotao water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the surface of water bodies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Pteris sotae plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
