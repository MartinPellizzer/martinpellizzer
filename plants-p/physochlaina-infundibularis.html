<p>Physochlaina infundibularis, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky soils and dry landscapes. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The species is also known for its toxic properties, containing solanine-like compounds that can be harmful to humans and animals.</p>
