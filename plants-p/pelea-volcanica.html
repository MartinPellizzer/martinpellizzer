<p>Pelea volcanica, commonly known as the volcanic pelea, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in nutrient-rich soils found in volcanic landscapes, often growing near hot springs or geothermal areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Pelea volcanica is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
