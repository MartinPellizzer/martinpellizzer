<p>Phaseolus vulgaris var. bocconei, commonly known as the Bocconea bean, is a lesser-known variant of the common bean.</p>

This variety is native to Central America and is often grown for its ornamental value rather than culinary use. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in horticultural and genetic studies.</p>
