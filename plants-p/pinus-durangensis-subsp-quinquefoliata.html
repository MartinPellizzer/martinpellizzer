<p>Pinus durangensis subsp.</p>
<p>quinquefoliata, commonly known as the Durango five-leaf pine, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive five-needle fascicles, which set it apart from other pine species in the region.</p>
<p>The tree typically grows in high-altitude pine forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its cones are small and often remain closed for many years, releasing seeds during periods of environmental stress.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
