                    <h1>Potentilla wimanniana subvar. argenteiformis</h1>
<p>Potentilla wimanniana subvar. argenteiformis, commonly known as silverleaf potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its frost-resistant nature and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
