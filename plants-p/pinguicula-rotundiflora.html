<p>Pinguicula rotundiflora, commonly known as the round-flowered butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptation allows it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
