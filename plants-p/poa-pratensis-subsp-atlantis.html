<p>Poa pratensis subsp.</p>
<p>atlantis, commonly known as the Atlantis meadow grass, is a rare and specialized variant of the tall fescue species. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and dense, compact growth habit, often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is typically associated with wet meadows and marshy habitats, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowering stems bear spikelets that are usually shorter than those of the typical Poa pratensis.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest in conservation botany.</p>
