<p>Phalangium lilaceum, commonly known as the lace fern, is a delicate and elegant plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is short and produces both roots and fertile shoots.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sorus, which is located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
