<p>Prunus spinosa f. plano-subgloboso-drupacea, commonly known as the flat-subglobous drupaceous blackthorn, is a variant of the common blackthorn, characterized by its distinctive flattened, subglobous fruit structure.</p>
<p>The plant is a shrub native to Europe and western Asia, typically found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, dark purple berries that are a key feature of its botanical profile. The fruit develops from a drupe, which is a fleshy outer layer surrounding a hard pit.</p>
<p>This form is notable for its unique morphology, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticultural collections.</p>
