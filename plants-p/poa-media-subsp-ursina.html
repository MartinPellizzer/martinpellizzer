<p>Poa media subsp.</p>
<p>ursina, commonly known as the alpine meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, tufted culms with small, spikelet-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range.</p>
