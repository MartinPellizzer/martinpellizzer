<p>Phreatia latipetala, commonly known as the broad-petaled phreatia, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of other plants rather than in soil.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators.</p>
