<p>Plectronia molundensis, commonly known as the Molund's plectron, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, showy inflorescences composed of small, clustered flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing vibrant purple to pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to withstand the cold and strong winds of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Plectronia molundensis is considered endangered and is the subject of ongoing conservation efforts.</p>
