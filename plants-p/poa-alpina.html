                <h1>Poa alpina</h1>
<p>Poa alpina, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cold, rocky, and nutrient-poor environments, often found in alpine meadows and tundra regions.</p>
<p>Poa alpina plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife.</p>
