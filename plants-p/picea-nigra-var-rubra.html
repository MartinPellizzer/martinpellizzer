                    <h1>Picea nigra var. rubra</h1>
<p>Picea nigra var. rubra, commonly known as the red spruce, is a variant of the black spruce native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark red bark and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more sharply pointed than those of the standard black spruce. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions and boreal forests.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ecological role and historical use in timber and paper production.</p>
