                    <h1>Ptilotrichum saxigenum</h1>
<p>Ptilotrichum saxigenum, commonly known as the rock hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>It features dense, tufted clusters of fine, hair-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in loose spikes, and it is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for colonizing steep, rocky slopes and crevices.</p>
<p>Ptilotrichum saxigenum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment.</p>
