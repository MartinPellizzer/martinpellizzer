<p>Pipturus cinnamomeus, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a striking fern species native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can reach up to two meters in length, with a distinctive cinnamon-brown fiddlehead at the base. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
