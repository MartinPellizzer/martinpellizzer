                    <h1>Pedicularis resupinata var. pygmaea</h1>
<p>Pedicularis resupinata var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf monkey orchid, is a delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and yellow. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
