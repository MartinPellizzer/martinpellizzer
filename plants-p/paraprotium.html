                    <h1>Paraprotium</h1>
<p>Paraprotium, commonly known as the cycad, is a primitive gymnosperm that belongs to the family Cycadaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. Paraprotium species are typically dioecious, meaning they have separate male and female plants. These plants are adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and often thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>They play an important role in ecological systems and are sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
