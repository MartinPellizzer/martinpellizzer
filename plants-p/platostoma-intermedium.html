                    <h1>Platostoma intermedium</h1>
<p>Platostoma intermedium, commonly known as the common liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a thalloid liverwort, meaning it has a flat, leaf-like structure called a thallus rather than true leaves or roots. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It reproduces through spores released from small, cup-like structures called gametophores.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
