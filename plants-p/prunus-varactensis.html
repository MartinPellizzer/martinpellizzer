                    <h1>Prunus varactensis</h1>
<p>Prunus varactensis, commonly known as the Varacten cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, typically white or pale pink, which give way to edible cherries that are small and sweet. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
<p>The fruit is not only tasty but also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
