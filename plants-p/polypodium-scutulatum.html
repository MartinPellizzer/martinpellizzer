<p>Polypodium scutulatum, commonly known as the rock fern or shield fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium scutulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens.</p>
