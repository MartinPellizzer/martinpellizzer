                    <h1>Pyrenia aucuparia</h1>
<p>Pyrenia aucuparia, commonly known as the common waxcap, is a type of fungi rather than a plant, belonging to the family Hygrophoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its waxy, often pale yellow or reddish cap and slender, fibrous stem. This fungus is typically found in grassy areas, especially in nutrient-poor soils, and is often associated with old, undisturbed habitats. It is considered a mycorrhizal fungus, forming symbiotic relationships with the roots of certain plants.</p>
<p>Pyrenia aucuparia is prized by foragers for its unique flavor and is often found in woodland and meadow environments.</p>
