<p>Polybotrya bifurcata, commonly known as the forked fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that split into two distinct branches, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in fine, hairy structures that aid in water retention.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
