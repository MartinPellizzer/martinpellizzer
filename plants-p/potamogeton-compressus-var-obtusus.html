<p>Potamogeton compressus var. obtusus, commonly known as the broadleaf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It has long, narrow leaves that are typically broader at the base and taper toward the tip, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, which are often submerged or just below the water surface. It thrives in slow-moving to still waters, such as lakes, ponds, and wetlands, and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its presence can indicate good water quality and is often used as a bioindicator in ecological studies.</p>
