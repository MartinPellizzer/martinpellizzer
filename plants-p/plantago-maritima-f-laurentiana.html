                    <h1>Plantago maritima f. laurentiana</h1>
<p>Plantago maritima f. laurentiana, commonly known as the Laurentian plantain, is a variant of the common plantain that thrives in coastal and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, typical of the Plantaginaceae family. It is typically found in sandy soils along shorelines and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to tolerate salt spray and is an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
