<p>Pterocarpus belizensis, commonly known as the Belize rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central America, particularly Belize and southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its density and beauty. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, seed-like structures. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, ovate leaflets, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in lowland tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is considered endangered and is protected in several regions.</p>
