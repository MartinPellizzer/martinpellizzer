                    <h1>Primula sibirica var. arctica</h1>
<p>Primula sibirica var. arctica, commonly known as the Arctic primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help to insulate the plant and reduce water loss in cold environments. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink or purple flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the surrounding vegetation emerges. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions.</p>
<p>This hardy species is often used in alpine gardens and as a symbol of resilience in extreme climates.</p>
