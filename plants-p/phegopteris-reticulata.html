                <h1>Phegopteris reticulata</h1>
<p>Phegopteris reticulata, commonly known as the veined wood fern, is a species of fern characterized by its intricate frond structure.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit with a long, horizontal underground stem. The fronds are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of pinnae, giving the plant a finely divided appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>The plant's spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori.</p>
