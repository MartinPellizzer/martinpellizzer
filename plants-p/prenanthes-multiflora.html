                    <h1>Prenanthes multiflora</h1>
<p>Prenanthes multiflora, commonly known as the common water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant has rounded, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>Prenanthes multiflora plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and waterfowl.</p>
