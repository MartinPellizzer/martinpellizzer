                    <h1>Parnassia laxmannii var. viridiflora</h1>
<p>Parnassia laxmannii var. viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered parnassia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its small, white or greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as alpine meadows and forested areas. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions.</p>
