                    <h1>Pandanus stolonifer</h1>
<p>Pandanus stolonifer, commonly known as the stoloniferous pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, paddle-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically grouped in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its root system is fibrous and helps it thrive in wet, coastal environments.</p>
<p>The stolons, or runners, allow it to spread vegetatively and form dense clumps.</p>
