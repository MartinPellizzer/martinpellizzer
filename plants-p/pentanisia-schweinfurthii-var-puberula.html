                    <h1>Pentanisia schweinfurthii var. puberula</h1>
<p>Pentanisia schweinfurthii var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy pentanisia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cucurbitaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) stems and leaves, which provide a distinctive appearance. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are typically clustered in racemes, and it produces small, round fruits that are edible.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitats.</p>
