                    <h1>Psychotrophum herbaceum</h1>
<p>Psychotrophum herbaceum, commonly known as the creeping psychotrop, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features wiry, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Psychotrophum herbaceum is adapted to survive in drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
