<p>Pterostylis emarginata, commonly known as the emarginate helmet-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a slender, hairy stem and produces a single, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive helmet-shaped labellum. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly thrips, which are attracted to the nectar-rich structures.</p>
<p>The orchid is characterized by its small size and specialized morphology adapted for its specific ecological niche.</p>
