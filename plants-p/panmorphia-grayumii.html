                    <h1>Panmorphia grayumii</h1>
<p>Panmorphia grayumii, commonly known as the Grayum's panmorph, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, often attracting specific pollinators such as moths and bees. The plant has a compact, succulent-like growth habit, with thick, fleshy leaves adapted to store water. Its flowering period typically occurs during the late summer months, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Panmorphia grayumii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
