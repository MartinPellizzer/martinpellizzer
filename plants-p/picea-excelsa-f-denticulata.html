<p>Picea excelsa f. denticulata, commonly known as the denticulate white spruce, is a botanical variant of the white spruce native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>This form is characterized by its finely serrated leaf margins, distinguishing it from the typical white spruce. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments, often growing in coniferous forests and alpine zones. The plant exhibits a conical shape with dark green, needle-like leaves that are short and stiff.</p>
<p>It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
