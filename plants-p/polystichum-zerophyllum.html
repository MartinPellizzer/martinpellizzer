                    <h1>Polystichum zerophyllum</h1>
<p>Polystichum zerophyllum, commonly known as the desert shield fern, is a unique fern species adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that remain upright and do not droop, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces spore-bearing soruses on the underside of its fronds, typical of ferns. It is native to regions with harsh, dry climates, such as parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in low-water conditions makes it an interesting subject for botanical study in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
