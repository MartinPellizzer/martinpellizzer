<p>Piper begoniifolium, commonly known as the begonia-leaved pepper, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, begonia-like leaves that are deeply lobed and often display vibrant green or variegated patterns. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to yellow, which are followed by berry-like fruits. Its foliage is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value, though it is not typically cultivated for its edible fruits.</p>
