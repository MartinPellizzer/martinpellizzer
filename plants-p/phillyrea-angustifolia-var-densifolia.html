                    <h1>Phillyrea angustifolia var. densifolia</h1>
<p>Phillyrea angustifolia var. densifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved Phillyrea, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are narrower and more clustered compared to the typical variety. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and seasonal floral display.</p>
