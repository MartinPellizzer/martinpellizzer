<p>Phreatia cylindrostachya var. grandifolia, commonly known as the giant phreatia orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant features a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually broad and革质 (leathery), providing structural support and reducing water loss.</p>
