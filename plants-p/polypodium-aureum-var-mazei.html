                    <h1>Polypodium aureum var. mazei</h1>
<p>Polypodium aureum var. mazei, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a rare variant of the polypody fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow fronds that contrast sharply with its dark, leathery rhizomes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are clustered on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
