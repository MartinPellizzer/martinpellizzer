                    <h1>Pedicularis kuljabensis</h1>
<p>Pedicularis kuljabensis, commonly known as the Kashmir orchid, is a striking member of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on other plants for nutrients through its root system. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, it thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a subject of interest in both botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
