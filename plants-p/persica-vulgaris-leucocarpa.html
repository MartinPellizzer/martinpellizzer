<p>Persica vulgaris leucocarpa, commonly known as the white peach.</p>
<p>This variant of the peach tree is characterized by its pale pink to white flesh, which sets it apart from the more common yellow or orange-fleshed peaches. The plant produces small, round fruits with a smooth, thin skin that is typically pale in color. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually white or light pink, contributing to its ornamental value in addition to its edible fruit.</p>
