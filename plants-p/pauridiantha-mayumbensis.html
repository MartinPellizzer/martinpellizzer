                    <h1>Pauridiantha mayumbensis</h1>
<p>Pauridiantha mayumbensis, commonly known as the Mayumb√© sand mat, is a rare flowering plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with narrow, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, which are typically visited by insects for pollination. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, seasonal climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
