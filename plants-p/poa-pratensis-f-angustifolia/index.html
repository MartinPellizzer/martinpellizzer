<p>Narrowleaf meadowgrass, scientifically known as Poa pratensis f. angustifolia, is a distinctive variant of the common meadowgrass species. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that give it a unique appearance compared to its broader relatives. This plant is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands across temperate regions. Its delicate foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects. Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it plays an important role in both natural and cultivated landscapes.</p>
