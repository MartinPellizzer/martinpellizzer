<p>Prosopis dulcis var. domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican carob tree, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>It produces long, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds surrounded by a sweet, sticky pulp. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soils. Its leaves are compound, consisting of multiple small leaflets, and it has a distinctive grayish-bark with fissures.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and its historical use in traditional medicine and as a food source.</p>
