<p>Pogonia bicarinata, commonly known as the two-ridged bog orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to wetlands and bogs in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, violet to purple flowers with distinctive ridges on the petals and sepals. The plant has a slender, erect stem that supports a single or few flowers, each with a unique, spurred lip. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in moist, acidic environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Pogonia bicarinata is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
