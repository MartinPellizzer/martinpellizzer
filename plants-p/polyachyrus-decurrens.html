<p>Polyachyrus decurrens, commonly known as the creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its creeping growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it suitable for ground cover in rock gardens or shaded areas.</p>
<p>The leaves are commonly used in culinary applications due to their strong, aromatic scent.</p>
