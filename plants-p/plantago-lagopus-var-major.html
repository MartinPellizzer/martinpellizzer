                    <h1>Plantago lagopus var. major</h1>
<p>Plantago lagopus var. major, commonly known as the greater plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces tall flowering stems bearing clusters of small, greenish flowers that develop into seed capsules. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>The leaves are used in traditional medicine for their mild laxative and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
