                    <h1>Phoradendron treleaseanum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron treleaseanum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain toxic seeds. Its life cycle involves birds dispersing the seeds, which then germinate on the bark of host trees.</p>
<p>This plant plays a significant ecological role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and supporting bird populations.</p>
