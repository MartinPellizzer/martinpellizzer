<p>Phragmites communis var. striatopictus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved common reed, is a perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, striped leaves and tall, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in late summer. This variant is often found in marshes, along shorelines, and in other moist habitats. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense colonies, which can dominate wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
