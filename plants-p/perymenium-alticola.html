<p>Perymenium alticola, commonly known as the highland bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in nutrient-poor conditions. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Perymenium alticola plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web through both its prey capture and as a food source for other organisms.</p>
