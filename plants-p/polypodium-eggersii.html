<p>Polypodium eggersii, commonly known as the Eggers' water fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile fronds in the second. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are dispersed through the wind, and the plant is well adapted to humid, tropical climates.</p>
<p>Polypodium eggersii is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in maintaining forest biodiversity.</p>
