                    <h1>Platanus orientalis f. occidentaloides</h1>
<p>Platanus orientalis f. occidentaloides, commonly known as the western plane tree, is a variant of the oriental plane tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically larger and more elongated than those of the typical oriental plane. The tree produces distinctive, spherical clusters of small, greenish flowers in the spring. Its bark is thick, flaky, and greyish, providing a rugged appearance.</p>
<p>This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value in urban landscapes due to its tolerance of pollution and compact growth habit.</p>
