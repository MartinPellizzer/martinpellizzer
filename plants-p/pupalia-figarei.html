<p>Pupalia figarei, commonly known as the rock fig or rock fig tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical gardens.</p>
