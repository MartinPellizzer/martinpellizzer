<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil or rock surfaces.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds.</p>
