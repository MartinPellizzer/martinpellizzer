                    <h1>Poa alsodes var. wolfii</h1>
<p>Poa alsodes var. wolfii, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage that reflects its cold-climate adaptation. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountain slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized member of the Poaceae family.</p>
