<p>Palisota thollonii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
