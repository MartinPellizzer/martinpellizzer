<p>Paspalum formosum, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>

The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it blend into its wetland surroundings.</p>
<p>Paspalum formosum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
