                    <h1>Poa salebrosa</h1>
<p>Poa salebrosa, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, sometimes hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Poa salebrosa is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
