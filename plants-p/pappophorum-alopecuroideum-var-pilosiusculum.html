                    <h1>Pappophorum alopecuroideum var. pilosiusculum</h1>
<p>Pappophorum alopecuroideum var. pilosiusculum, commonly known as the hairy meadow grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and hairy leaf blades.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows and along stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and slightly rolled, with a distinctive hairy texture that aids in moisture retention.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators.</p>
