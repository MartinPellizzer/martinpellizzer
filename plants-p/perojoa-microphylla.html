The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, Perojoa microphylla is often used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
