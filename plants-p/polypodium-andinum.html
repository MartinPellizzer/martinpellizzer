                    <h1>Polypodium andinum</h1>
<p>Polypodium andinum, commonly known as the Andean shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in shaded, moist habitats at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself firmly in the soil.</p>
<p>Polypodium andinum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
