<p>Pellegrinia lobbii, commonly known as the silver bush, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, helping it thrive in hot, arid environments. The plant features small, fleshy leaves arranged in a compact rosette pattern, which aids in water retention. It produces delicate, violet-blue flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage.</p>
<p>Pellegrinia lobbii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
