                    <h1>Pedicularis rex var. lopingensis</h1>
<p>Pedicularis rex var. lopingensis, commonly known as the Lopingensis monkey orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers that resemble a monkey's face, giving it its common name. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
