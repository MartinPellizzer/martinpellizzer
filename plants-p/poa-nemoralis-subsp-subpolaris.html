<p>Poa nemoralis subsp.</p>
<p>subpolaris, commonly known as the polar bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in extreme cold and low light conditions makes it an important component of polar ecosystems.</p>
