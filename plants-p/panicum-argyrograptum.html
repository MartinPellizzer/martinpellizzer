                    <h1>Panicum argyrograptum</h1>
<p>Panicum argyrograptum, commonly known as silverleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces slender, drooping spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple, adding visual interest. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, low-growing mats.</p>
