<p>Platanthera chloranthella, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which helps it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
