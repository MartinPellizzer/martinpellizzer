                    <h1>Picea robertii</h1>
<p>Picea robertii, commonly known as the Robert's spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of other spruce species. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Picea robertii thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in subalpine and alpine forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the mountain ecosystems where it is endemic.</p>
