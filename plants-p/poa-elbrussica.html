                    <h1>Poa elbrussica</h1>
<p>Poa elbrussica, commonly known as the Elbrus grass, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus Mountains.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine and subalpine zones. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, Poa elbrussica is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
