                    <h1>Phoradendron velutinum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron velutinum, commonly known as the velvet mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It possesses small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces white, waxy flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, round berries that are dispersed by birds. Its roots form haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to absorb water and nutrients.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its ecosystem, supporting a variety of insect and bird life.</p>
