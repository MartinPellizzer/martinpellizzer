                    <h1>Platostoma clausum</h1>
<p>Platostoma clausum, commonly known as the closed shield fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, compact fronds with a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, contributing to its unique reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Platostoma clausum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
