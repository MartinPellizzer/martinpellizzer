                    <h1>Pseudophegopteris</h1>
<p>Pseudophegopteris, commonly known as the false cliff brake, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Pseudophegopteris species are known for their small, inconspicuous spore-producing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>These ferns play a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in their native ecosystems.</p>
