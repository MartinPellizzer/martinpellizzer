<p>Parodia erythrantha var. thionantha, commonly known as the "Red-Fleshed Barrel Cactus," is a compact, spherical cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a ribbed, cylindrical stem that is typically green with reddish or pinkish hues, especially when exposed to sunlight.

Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted for water storage, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>This variety is prized in horticulture for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
