                    <h1>Pycreus pulvinatus</h1>
<p>Pycreus pulvinatus, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, adapted for pollination by wind or insects. Its succulent structure allows it to survive in harsh, rocky conditions with minimal water.</p>
<p>Pycreus pulvinatus is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil.</p>
