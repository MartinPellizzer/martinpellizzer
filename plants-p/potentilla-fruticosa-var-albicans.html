                    <h1>Potentilla fruticosa var. albicans</h1>
<p>Potentilla fruticosa var. albicans, commonly known as the whiteflower cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with many small, woody stems that form a dense mat. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other species in the Potentilla genus, sharing similar ecological and botanical traits.</p>
