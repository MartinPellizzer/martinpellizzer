<p>Platystele altarica, commonly known as the Altarica ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves and tiny, inconspicuous flowers. Native to the cloud forests of Mexico, it thrives in shaded, humid environments with high atmospheric moisture. The plant is notable for its unique morphology, including its short, fleshy rhizomes and specialized root system adapted for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and threats from deforestation, Platystele altarica is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
