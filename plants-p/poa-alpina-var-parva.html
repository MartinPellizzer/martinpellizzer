                    <h1>Poa alpina var. parva</h1>
<p>Poa alpina var. parva, commonly known as the dwarf alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to alpine and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths that help stabilize soil in harsh environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive at high altitudes where few other plants can survive.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
