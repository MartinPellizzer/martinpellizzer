<p>Panicum agglutinans, commonly known as the sticky panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, sticky seeds that adhere to clothing and animals. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, ditches, and prairies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>The sticky seeds of Panicum agglutinans are an adaptation that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to passing fauna.</p>
