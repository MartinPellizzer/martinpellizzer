<p>Poa × coarctata var. montana, commonly known as the mountain bluegrass, is a hybrid grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its rhizomatous and stolonal growth allows it to form extensive mats, which help stabilize soil in rocky or unstable environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with blue-green glumes, contributing to its ornamental value in garden settings.</p>
