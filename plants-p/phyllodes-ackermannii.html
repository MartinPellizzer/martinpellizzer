<p>Phyllodes ackermannii, commonly known as the Grey Box, is a shrub native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, leathery phyllodes that are often grey-green in color. The plant has a woody structure with a dense canopy, and its leaves are modified into flattened stems called phyllodes, which reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, yellow flowers in summer, followed by pod-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Phyllodes ackermannii is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in heathlands and woodlands.</p>
