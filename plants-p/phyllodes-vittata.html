<p>Phyllodes vittata, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like structures called phyllodes, which are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in spherical heads. Its phyllodes are often covered in a fine, silvery coating that reflects sunlight.</p>
<p>Phyllodes vittata is well-suited for drought-tolerant landscaping due to its hardy nature.</p>
