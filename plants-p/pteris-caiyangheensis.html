                    <h1>Pteris caiyangheensis</h1>
<p>Pteris caiyangheensis, commonly known as the Caiyanghe water fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bi-lobed. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
