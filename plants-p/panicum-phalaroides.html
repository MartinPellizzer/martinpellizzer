<p>Panicum phalaroides, commonly known as yellow foxtail, is a warm-season grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and long, narrow leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets that form the distinctive foxtail-like inflorescence, which is typically golden-yellow in color. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become a troublesome weed in agricultural settings.</p>
