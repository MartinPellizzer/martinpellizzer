<p>Parrycactus alamosanus subsp.</p>
<p>reppenhagenii, commonly known as the Reppenhagen's parrycactus, is a rare cactus species native to specific regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white to pale blue spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils with full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
