<p>Patagonium longisetum var. landbeckii, commonly known as the Andean hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
