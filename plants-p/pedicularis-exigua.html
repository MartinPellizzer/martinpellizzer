<p>Pedicularis exigua, commonly known as the dwarf monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. It produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Pedicularis exigua is often considered a rare and delicate species.</p>
