                    <h1>Prunus persica lusus pendula</h1>
<p>Prunus persica lusus pendula, commonly known as the weeping peach tree, is a cultivar of the peach tree characterized by its cascading branches that droop gracefully from the main trunk.</p>
<p>This ornamental tree features smooth, grey-brown bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn a vibrant yellow in the fall. The flowers are pinkish-white with a subtle fragrance, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. It produces sweet, juicy fruits similar to regular peaches, though the fruit size is often smaller.</p>
<p>The tree is well-suited for gardens and parks, offering both aesthetic appeal and edible harvest.</p>
