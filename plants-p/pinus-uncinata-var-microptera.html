                    <h1>Pinus uncinata var. microptera</h1>
<p>Pinus uncinata var. microptera, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a rare and distinctive variant of the mountain pine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, twisted branches, which give it a unique, gnarled appearance. The needles are typically shorter and more clustered than those of the typical pine, and the cones are small and often persist on the tree for several years. This variety is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in rocky soils and harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
