                    <h1>Puya fiebrigii</h1>
<p>Puya fiebrigii, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking bromeliad native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height, adorned with vibrant red and orange flowers. The plant forms a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that store water, adapting to its arid environment. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is often cultivated as a specimen plant in botanical gardens.</p>
