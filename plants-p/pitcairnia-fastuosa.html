                    <h1>Pitcairnia fastuosa</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia fastuosa, commonly known as the Queen of the Andes, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cup, a feature common among bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that can last for several months, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in its humid, high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia fastuosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
