                    <h1>Polystichum aculeatum var. variiforme</h1>
<p>Polystichum aculeatum var. variiforme, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its variability in leaf shape and size, which contributes to its common name.</p>
