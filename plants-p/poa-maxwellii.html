<p>Poa maxwellii, commonly known as Maxwell's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growth with slender, dark green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as coastal dunes and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
