                    <h1>Polypodium polystichoides</h1>
<p>Polypodium polystichoides, commonly known as the cliff brake, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in rocky, shaded environments, often growing on cliffs or in moist, well-drained soil. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Polypodium polystichoides plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats and provides shelter for small invertebrates.</p>
