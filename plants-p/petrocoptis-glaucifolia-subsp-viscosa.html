<p>Petrocoptis glaucifolia subsp.</p>
<p>viscosa, commonly known as the sticky glaucous rock-cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its glaucous, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, sticky resin, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous or desert-like habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic plant species.</p>
