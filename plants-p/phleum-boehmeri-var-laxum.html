<p>Phleum boehmeri var. laxum, commonly known as soft brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
