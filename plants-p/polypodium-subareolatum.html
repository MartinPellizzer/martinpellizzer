                    <h1>Polypodium subareolatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium subareolatum, commonly known as the small-areolate fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in small, rounded structures called areolae. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of forests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
