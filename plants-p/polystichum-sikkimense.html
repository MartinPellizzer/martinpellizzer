                    <h1>Polystichum sikkimense</h1>
<p>Polystichum sikkimense, commonly known as the Sikkim deer fern, is a species of fern native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial plant characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in forest understories at high altitudes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Polystichum sikkimense is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
