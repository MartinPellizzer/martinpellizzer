<p>Phoradendron microcephalum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on various species of oak trees.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or pale green berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. The plant has a unique life cycle, with its seeds being carried to the canopy by birds and germinating on the bark of host trees. It forms dense clusters of shoots that can significantly affect the growth and health of its host.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include small, leathery leaves and a short, woody stem.</p>
