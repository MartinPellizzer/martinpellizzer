                    <h1>Ptarmica pectinata</h1>
<p>Ptarmica pectinata, commonly known as the yellow lichen or yellow tufted lichen, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange coloration, which comes from the presence of the pigment pectin. The thallus is foliose, meaning it has leaf-like structures, and it often grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate regions. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments and is used in traditional medicine for its antiseptic properties.</p>
<p>This lichen is also an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
