<p>Polypodium sporadolepis, commonly known as the sporadolepis holly fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate or tripinnate. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
