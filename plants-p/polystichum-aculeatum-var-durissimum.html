                    <h1>Polystichum aculeatum var. durissimum</h1>
<p>Polystichum aculeatum var. durissimum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stiff, upright fronds that are covered in small, rough-scaled structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>The varietal form, durissimum, is distinguished by its more robust and densely scaled fronds compared to the typical variety.</p>
