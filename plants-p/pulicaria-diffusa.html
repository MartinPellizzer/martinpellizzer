<p>Pulicaria diffusa, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas and dry habitats. The plant has small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Pulicaria diffusa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and tolerate harsh environments.</p>
