<p>Prunus persica var. platycarpa, commonly known as the flat-seeded peach, is a botanical variant of the peach tree characterized by its flattened, less rounded seeds.</p>
<p>This cultivar is typically smaller than the standard peach, with a thinner skin and a sweeter, more delicate flavor. It is native to China and has been cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit. The plant produces pink to white flowers in the spring, followed by fuzzy, yellow-orange fruit in the summer.</p>
<p>Its growth habit is similar to other Prunus species, with a rounded crown and moderate growth rate.</p>
