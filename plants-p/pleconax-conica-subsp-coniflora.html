<p>Pleconax conica subsp.</p>
<p>coniflora, commonly known as the conical pleconax, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its unique conical shape and finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
