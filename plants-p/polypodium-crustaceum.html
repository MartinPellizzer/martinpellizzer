<p>Polypodium crustaceum, commonly known as the crustacean fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, carpet-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, overlapping fronds that resemble the exoskeleton of a crustacean, hence its common name. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found on rocky surfaces or in dense forest understories.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically green and can develop a reddish hue when exposed to direct sunlight.</p>
