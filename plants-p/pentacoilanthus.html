                    <h1>Pentacoilanthus</h1>
<p>Pentacoilanthus, commonly known as the five-armed clubmoss, is a genus of small, herbaceous plants belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that form compact, cushion-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Pentacoilanthus species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to their limited distribution and specialized habitats, they are considered rare and of conservation interest.</p>
