                    <h1>Platystele hampshireae</h1>
<p>Platystele hampshireae, commonly known as the Hampshire's ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and small, white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to grow, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, it is critically endangered and protected in its native range.</p>
