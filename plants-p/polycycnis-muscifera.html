<p>Polycycnis muscifera, commonly known as the musk orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fragrant, musk-scented flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a series of leaves and flowering shoots. Its roots are often covered in a dense, moss-like covering, which helps in moisture retention.</p>
<p>The orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or in dense undergrowth.</p>
