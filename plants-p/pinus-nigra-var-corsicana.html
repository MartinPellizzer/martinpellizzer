<p>Pinus nigra var. corsicana, commonly known as the Corsican pine, is a subspecies of the black pine native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia.</p>
<p>It is a tall, evergreen conifer with needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are woody and elongated, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against environmental stressors.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its hardiness and is often used in reforestation efforts due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
