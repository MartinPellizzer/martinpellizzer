                    <h1>Pleopeltis kashyapii</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis kashyapii, commonly known as the Kashyapi's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and possesses broad, leathery fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
