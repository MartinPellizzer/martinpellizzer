<p>Poterium sphacioticum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water plantain, is a flowering plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Alismataceae and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, white flowers that are arranged in dense clusters, typically emerging from the water surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize marshy areas effectively.</p>
<p>Poterium sphacioticum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
