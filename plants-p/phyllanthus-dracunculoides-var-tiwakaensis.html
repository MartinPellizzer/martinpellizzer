                    <h1>Phyllanthus dracunculoides var. tiwakaensis</h1>
<p>Phyllanthus dracunculoides var. tiwakaensis, commonly known as the Tiwaka milkweed, is a shrub native to the Pacific Islands, particularly found in Tonga and Samoa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant produces a milky latex when the stems or leaves are broken, which is a common feature in the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range.</p>
