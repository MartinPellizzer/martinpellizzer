                    <h1>Pieris repens</h1>
<p>Pieris repens, commonly known as Japanese pieris, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features leathery, dark green elliptical leaves that are often adorned with white or silver markings. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue, waxy berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, compact foliage that remains attractive throughout the year.</p>
