<p>Paepalanthus elatus var. calvulus, commonly known as the silver leaf cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to silver hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It typically grows as a low, mat-forming shrub, often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
