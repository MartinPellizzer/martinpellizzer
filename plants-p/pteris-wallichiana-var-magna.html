<p>Pteris wallichiana var. magna, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a variant of the common water fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a fern characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. Its fronds are bipinnate, with numerous small, rounded pinnae that contribute to its distinctive appearance.</p>
