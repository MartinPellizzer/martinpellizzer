                    <h1>Polypodium exsul</h1>
<p>Polypodium exsul, commonly known as the wandering fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Polypodium exsul has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats.</p>
