                    <h1>Pteris tricolor</h1>
<p>Pteris tricolor, commonly known as the tri-color fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate fronds that display three distinct color zonesâ€”usually green, brown, and gold. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately divided, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
