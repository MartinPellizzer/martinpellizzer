                    <h1>Phoradendron macrocarpum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron macrocarpum, commonly known as the giant mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has woody stems and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it provides nectar to pollinators like bees and wasps. Its berries, which are dark red and fleshy, are an important food source for birds.</p>
<p>The plant's life cycle involves both seed dispersal by animals and the establishment of new growth on host trees.</p>
