                            <h1>Penstemon Lemhiensis</h1>
<p>Penstemon lemhiensis, also known as the Lemhi penstemon, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the western United States. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. This species is notable for its vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Despite its beauty, Penstemon lemhiensis faces threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
