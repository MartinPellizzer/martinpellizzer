<p>Polypodium ptilodon, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a unique texture. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often as an epiphyte. Its fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that contribute to its dense, shield-like appearance.</p>
<p>Polypodium ptilodon is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
