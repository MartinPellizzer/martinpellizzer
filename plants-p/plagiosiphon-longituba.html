<p>Plagiosiphon longituba, commonly known as the long-stemmed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey. This plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the stems bear the specialized bladders used for capturing prey.</p>
<p>The plant is native to parts of Asia and is known for its unique adaptation to nutrient-poor aquatic environments.</p>
