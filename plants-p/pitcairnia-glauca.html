                    <h1>Pitcairnia glauca</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia glauca, commonly known as the blue pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with vibrant blue-violet flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its native high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia glauca is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions.</p>
