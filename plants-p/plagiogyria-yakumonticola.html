                    <h1>Plagiogyria yakumonticola</h1>
<p>Plagiogyria yakumonticola, commonly known as the Yakutian plagiogyria, is a rare and specialized moss species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Siberia.</p>
<p>It thrives in extremely cold, nutrient-poor environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in moist, shaded areas. The plant exhibits a compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it retain moisture and withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a distinct midrib, and it reproduces via spores released from tiny, clustered capsules.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for high-altitude and polar ecosystems.</p>
