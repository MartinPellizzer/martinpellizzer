                    <h1>Ptilimnium viviparum</h1>
<p>Ptilimnium viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous ptilimnium, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is often found in moist, calcareous soils, such as those in meadows and wetlands. One of its notable features is its viviparous reproduction, where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
<p>This adaptation allows it to establish itself more effectively in suitable habitats.</p>
