<p>Pityrogramma ochracea, commonly known as the yellow water fern, is a small, aquatic fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its fronds are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with a waxy coating that helps it float.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
