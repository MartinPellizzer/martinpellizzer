                    <h1>Plectocomia</h1>
<p>Plectocomia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a type of orchid that lacks leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are often submerged in water. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer, making it a striking yet elusive species. Its unique appearance and habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial due to its endangered status and limited natural range.</p>
