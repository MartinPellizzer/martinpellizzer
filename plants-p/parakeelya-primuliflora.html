                    <h1>Parakeelya primuliflora</h1>
<p>Parakeelya primuliflora, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia, where it grows as an epiphyte on tree trunks and branches. The plant produces delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in summer, resembling the ghostly appearance for which it is named. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Parakeelya primuliflora is considered one of the most endangered orchids in the world.</p>
