                    <h1>Polypodium cicutarium</h1>
<p>Polypodium cicutarium, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. It is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ability to grow without soil make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
