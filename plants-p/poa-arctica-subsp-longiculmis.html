<p>Poa arctica subsp.</p>
<p>longiculmis, commonly known as the Arctic feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil, and thrives in open, rocky habitats. Its flowers are small and spike-like, arranged in a loose panicle, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic organisms.</p>
