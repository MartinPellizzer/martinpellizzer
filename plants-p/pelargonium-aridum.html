<p>Pelargonium aridum, commonly known as the desert geranium, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to low rainfall and can survive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
