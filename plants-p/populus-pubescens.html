<p>Populus pubescens, commonly known as the downy poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish bark and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs.

It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Populus pubescens is valued for its fast growth and has been used in reforestation efforts due to its ecological benefits.</p>
