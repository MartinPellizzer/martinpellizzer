                    <h1>Potentilla caulescens var. nivalis</h1>
<p>Potentilla caulescens var. nivalis, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features wiry, hairy stems that are often covered in white or silver hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to withstand harsh mountain conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to high-altitude habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
