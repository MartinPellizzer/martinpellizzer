                    <h1>Piresia</h1>
<p>Piresia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are shrubs or small trees, characterized by their compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. They are valued for their hard, durable wood, which has been used historically in construction and craftsmanship.</p>
<p>However, many species are now threatened due to overharvesting and habitat loss.</p>
