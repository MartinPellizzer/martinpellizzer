<p>Plantago major var. pilosiuscula, commonly known as the hairy plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are borne on long, slender stems. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more pronounced hairy texture compared to other Plantago species.</p>
