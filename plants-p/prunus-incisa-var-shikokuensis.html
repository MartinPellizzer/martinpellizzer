                    <h1>Prunus incisa var. shikokuensis</h1>
<p>Prunus incisa var. shikokuensis, commonly known as the Shikoku cherry or Shikoku sakura, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and is prized for its ornamental value, particularly during the spring when it produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with finely serrated margins, and turn a striking yellow-green in autumn. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for gardens and parks.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in traditional Japanese landscape design and is a symbol of spring's arrival.</p>
