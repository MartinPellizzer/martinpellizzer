<p>Pinus clusiana subsp.</p>
<p>mauretanica, commonly known as the Mauretanian Atlas cedar, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure typical of the pine family.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in high-altitude, rocky environments with limited soil and moisture. Its cones are small and often remain closed for many years before releasing seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
