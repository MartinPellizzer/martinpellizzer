<p>Phyllomphax acuta, commonly known as the sharp-leafed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Phyllomphax acuta thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
