<p>Psammisia tovarensis, commonly known as the Tovarensis sandplant, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand sandy and saline conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered an important species for ecological restoration in coastal areas.</p>
