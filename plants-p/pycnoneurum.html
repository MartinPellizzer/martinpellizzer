                    <h1>Pycnoneurum</h1>
<p>Pycnoneurum, commonly known as the mountain pines, is a genus of coniferous evergreen trees belonging to the family Pinaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structures, which are typical of conifers. They are native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in the Himalayas and eastern China. Pycnoneurum species typically grow in high-altitude environments, where they adapt to cold and harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Their ecological role includes providing habitat for various alpine species and contributing to soil stabilization in rocky terrains.</p>
