                    <h1>Panax myriophyllus</h1>
<p>Panax myriophyllus, commonly known as the Japanese ginseng, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Japan and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, feather-like leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its roots are the primary part used in traditional medicine, believed to have adaptogenic and stimulant properties.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
