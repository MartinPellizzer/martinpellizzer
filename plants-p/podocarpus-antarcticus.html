<p>Podocarpus antarcticus, commonly known as the Antarctic podocarp, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and scale-like leaves that are arranged in flat, horizontal rows. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
