                    <h1>Pseuderanthemum pennellii</h1>
<p>Pseuderanthemum pennellii, commonly known as the white-flowered pseuderanthemum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble flowers but are actually clusters of small, clustered bracts. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its blooming period occurs during the warmer months, producing clusters of white or pale pink bracts that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments.</p>
