                    <h1>Polypodium echinosporum</h1>
<p>Polypodium echinosporum, commonly known as the spiny-sporangium fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a spiny, protective cupule. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
