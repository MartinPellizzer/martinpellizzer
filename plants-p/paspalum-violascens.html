<p>Paspalum violascens, commonly known as purple paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Paspalum violascens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in moist environments.</p>
