                    <h1>Pinus pumilio var. uncinata</h1>
<p>Pinus pumilio var. uncinata, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine or the whitebark pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine native to the high-altitude regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a small, coniferous evergreen tree with a slow growth rate and a distinctive pyramidal shape. The tree is characterized by its serotinous cones, which open only after a fire, releasing seeds for regeneration. Its needles are short, stiff, and often have a bluish-gray color, and it produces edible seeds known as pine nuts.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in cold, dry conditions with poor soil.</p>
