                    <h1>Phthirusa trichodes</h1>
<p>Phthirusa trichodes, commonly known as the hairy leaf gall midge, is a small fly belonging to the family Cecidomyiidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its minute size and distinctive larval galls that form on the leaves of specific host plants. The plant's botanical significance lies in its role as a host for this insect, which induces the formation of leaf galls through its feeding activities. These galls are often visible as abnormal growths on the foliage, altering the plant's structure and potentially affecting its growth.</p>
<p>The relationship between Phthirusa trichodes and its host plant is an example of plant-insect interaction that influences both ecological and agricultural systems.</p>
