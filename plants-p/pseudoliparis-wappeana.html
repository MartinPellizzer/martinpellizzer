<p>Pseudoliparis wappeana, commonly known as the Wappes' sea anemone, is a unique marine invertebrate found in deep-sea environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the order Ceriantharia, which includes tube-dwelling anemones that construct calcareous tubes for shelter. The plant, or more accurately, the organism, has a simple body structure with a central polyp and specialized tentacles for capturing prey. It plays a role in deep-sea ecosystems by providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its deep-water habitat, it is rarely studied and remains a subject of scientific interest.</p>
