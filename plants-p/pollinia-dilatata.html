                    <h1>Pollinia dilatata</h1>
<p>Pollinia dilatata, commonly known as the broadleaf orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique pollinarium structure, which consists of fused pollinia that are adapted for attachment to insect vectors. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals.</p>
<p>The botanical study of Pollinia dilatata provides insights into the evolutionary adaptations of orchids for pollination.</p>
