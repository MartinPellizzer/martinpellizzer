                    <h1>Phoradendron rotundifolium</h1>
<p>Phoradendron rotundifolium, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's tissue. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are rounded and arranged opposite each other along the stems.</p>
<p>It plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects.</p>
