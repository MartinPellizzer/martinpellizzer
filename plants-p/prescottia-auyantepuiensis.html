<p>Prescottia auyantepuiensis, commonly known as the Angel's Tears orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pendulous flowers that resemble delicate tears. The plant thrives in high-altitude, humid environments with nutrient-poor soils, often growing on rock surfaces. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
