                    <h1>Potamogeton × curvifolius</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × curvifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Potamogeton perfoliatus and Potamogeton crispus.</p>
<p>It is typically found in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers, where it thrives in shallow waters with soft substrates. The plant has long, slender leaves that are often curved or rolled, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it can exhibit variability in morphology, making it challenging to classify in some cases.</p>
