                    <h1>Ptychosperma singaporense</h1>
<p>Ptychosperma singaporense, commonly known as the Singapore cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Singapore.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in Singapore's conservation efforts.</p>
