<p>Prageluria, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, often with five petals. Prageluria species are native to regions of southern Africa, where they thrive in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>These plants are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
