<p>Panicum equitans f. aquaticum, commonly known as the water panicgrass, is a variant of the panic grass species that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along stream edges. Its adaptability to aquatic conditions is due to its rhizomatous growth habit and specialized leaf structures.</p>
<p>This fern-like grass plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
