                    <h1>Poa dactyliformis</h1>
<p>Poa dactyliformis, commonly known as the cushion grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, which allows it to thrive in rocky and arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs, providing protection against harsh conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>Poa dactyliformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
