                    <h1>Pteris furunculata</h1>
<p>Pteris furunculata, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, forming a symbiotic relationship with its host. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Pteris furunculata is well adapted to humid environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture.</p>
