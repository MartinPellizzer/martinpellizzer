                    <h1>Phymatodes nigrescens var. variabilis</h1>
<p>Phymatodes nigrescens var. variabilis, commonly known as the desert parsley, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of bluish-gray, aromatic leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its strong, spicy scent, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often found in disturbed or dry soils in desert ecosystems.</p>
