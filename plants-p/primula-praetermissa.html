                    <h1>Primula praetermissa</h1>
<p>Primula praetermissa, commonly known as the neglected primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 15â€“30 centimeters, featuring basal leaves that are broadly ovate with hairy surfaces. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat overlooked species within the Primula genus.</p>
