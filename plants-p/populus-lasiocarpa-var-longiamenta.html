                    <h1>Populus lasiocarpa var. longiamenta</h1>
<p>Populus lasiocarpa var. longiamenta, commonly known as the long-stalked cottonwood, is a variant of the cottonwood tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated petioles, which distinguish it from other Populus species. The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation across open areas. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture on the underside.</p>
<p>This variant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams.</p>
