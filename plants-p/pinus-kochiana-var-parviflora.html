                    <h1>Pinus kochiana var. parviflora</h1>
<p>Pinus kochiana var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a variant of the mountain pine native to the high altitudes of the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, twisted branches and a dense, rounded crown. The needles are typically shorter and more clustered than those of the typical mountain pine, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, pale yellow cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments with poor soil and extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
