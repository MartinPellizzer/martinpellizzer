                    <h1>Polylepis nitida</h1>
<p>Polylepis nitida, commonly known as the silver polylepis, is a deciduous tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and small, elliptical leaves that turn yellow before falling in the dry season. The tree produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Polylepis nitida is adapted to harsh, cold climates and is often found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
