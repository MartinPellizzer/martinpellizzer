                <h1>Parapentas setigera</h1>
<p>Parapentas setigera, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a unique vascular plant characterized by its distinctive, branching fronds that resemble a zigzag pattern.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with dense, clustered roots that help anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically lance-shaped and have a leathery texture, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Parapentas setigera is often found growing on rocks or in shaded forest floors, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade.</p>
