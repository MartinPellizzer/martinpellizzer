                    <h1>Psychrogeton alii</h1>
<p>Psychrogeton alii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in the hollows of longleaf pine forests. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture directly from the air, a feature that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor substrates.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Psychrogeton alii is considered critically endangered.</p>
