<p>Platykeleba insignis, commonly known as the rare mountain orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred petals and compact growth habit. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are typically pale pink or white with a subtle fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to climate change, Platykeleba insignis is considered an endangered species.</p>
