                    <h1>Pleiostachya pruinosa</h1>
<p>Pleiostachya pruinosa, commonly known as the silverleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from a dense layer of fine, whitish hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
