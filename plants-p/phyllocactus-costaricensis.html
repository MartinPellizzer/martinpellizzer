                    <h1>Phyllocactus costaricensis</h1>
<p>Phyllocactus costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican phyllocactus, is a unique cactus species native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, bushy structure. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation in arid environments.</p>
<p>Phyllocactus costaricensis is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for dry or semi-arid climates.</p>
