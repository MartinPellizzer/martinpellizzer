<p>Pilosocereus fulvilanatus, commonly known as the golden candelabra cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that are covered in dense, white to pale yellow spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
