<p>Papaver relictum var. steindorssonianum, commonly known as the Armenian poppy, is a rare and ancient species native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and grows in rocky or alpine environments. It is considered a relict species, indicating its evolutionary history from a more widespread ancestor.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is often protected and studied for its ecological and botanical significance.</p>
