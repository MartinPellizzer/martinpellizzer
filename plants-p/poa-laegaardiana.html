                    <h1>Poa laegaardiana</h1>
<p>Poa laegaardiana, commonly known as the Laegaard's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, moist environments, often found in tundra and alpine meadows where temperatures remain consistently low. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize the soil in fragile ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native habitats.</p>
