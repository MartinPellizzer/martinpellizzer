                    <h1>Polypodium hastatum var. engleri</h1>
<p>Polypodium hastatum var. engleri, commonly known as the Engler's cliff fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often deeply lobed and covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are relatively short and often form dense clusters, contributing to its ability to colonize rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
