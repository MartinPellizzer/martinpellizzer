                    <h1>Pierrina longifolia</h1>
<p>Pierrina longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf pierrina, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during the late spring and early summer months. Its fibrous root system is adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pierrina longifolia is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
