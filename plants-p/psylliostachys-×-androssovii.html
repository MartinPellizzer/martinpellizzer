                    <h1>Psylliostachys × androssovii</h1>
<p>Psylliostachys × androssovii, commonly known as the hybrid millet, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Psylliostachys huicui and Psylliostachys sibirica.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant is primarily cultivated for its potential as a biofuel crop due to its high biomass yield and adaptability to marginal soils. However, its sterility limits its use in traditional agricultural practices.</p>
<p>Despite this, it remains of interest in botanical research for its genetic diversity and ecological resilience.</p>
