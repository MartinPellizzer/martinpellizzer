                    <h1>Pseudotsuga taxifolia f. pendula</h1>
<p>Pseudotsuga taxifolia f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping Douglas fir, is a unique variant of the Douglas fir characterized by its cascading, drooping branches.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a distinct architectural appearance, with long, pendulous shoots that give it a graceful, weeping appearance. Botanically, it retains the conical shape of the parent species but displays a more open, spreading habit. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves, which are typically dark green and arranged in a flat, spreading pattern.</p>
<p>It is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking visual form.</p>
