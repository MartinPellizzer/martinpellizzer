                    <h1>Phyllota urodon</h1>
<p>Phyllota urodon, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Phyllota urodon is adapted to survive in dry environments with deep root systems and waxy leaves to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is not as well-known as other milkweed species.</p>
