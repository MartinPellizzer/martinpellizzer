                    <h1>Potentilla arenaria var. subcaulis</h1>
<p>Potentilla arenaria var. subcaulis, commonly known as sand cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and sandy environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is often found in coastal dunes, rocky slopes, and dry meadows.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing soil in degraded or sandy habitats.</p>
