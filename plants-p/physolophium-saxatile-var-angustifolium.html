<p>Physolophium saxatile var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saxatile physolophium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that often branch near the base, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color, which bloom during the warmer months. It is adapted to survive in poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its narrower foliage compared to the typical form of Physolophium saxatile.</p>
