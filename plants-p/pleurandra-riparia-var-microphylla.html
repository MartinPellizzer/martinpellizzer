                    <h1>Pleurandra riparia var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Pleurandra riparia var. microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a dense, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in the summer, which are followed by three-lobed, bladder-like fruits. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its aquatic adaptations, it plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
