                    <h1>Picea alba</h1>
<p>Picea alba, commonly known as the white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and grayish-blue foliage that turns a silvery white in winter. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thin and scaly, becoming more fissured with age.</p>
<p>The white spruce is adapted to cold climates and is often found in boreal forests and mountainous areas.</p>
