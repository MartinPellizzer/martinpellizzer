                    <h1>Polypodium filix-femina var. spinosum</h1>
<p>Polypodium filix-femina var. spinosum, commonly known as the spiny maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often adorned with small spines, giving it a distinctive appearance. This fern typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant.</p>
<p>The spiny features of its fronds are thought to provide some protection against herbivores.</p>
