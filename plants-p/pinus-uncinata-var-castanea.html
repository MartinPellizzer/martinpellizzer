                    <h1>Pinus uncinata var. castanea</h1>
<p>Pinus uncinata var. castanea, commonly known as the Castanea pine, is a rare and endemic variant of the serotinous pine found primarily in the Pyrenees.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, twisted needles and cones that remain closed until disturbed by fire or mechanical damage. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation to its harsh alpine environment, with a slow growth rate and dense foliage that helps retain heat. Its cones are typically reddish-brown and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind after the cones open.</p>
<p>This variant plays a crucial ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for specialized alpine flora and fauna.</p>
