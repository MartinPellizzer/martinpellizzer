                    <h1>Polygonum jeholense</h1>
<p>Polygonum jeholense, commonly known as the Jehol knotweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, somewhat woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
