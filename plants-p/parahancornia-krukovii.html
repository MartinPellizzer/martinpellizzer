<p>Parahancornia krukovii, commonly known as the Krukovii horse-hair plant, is a succulent native to the arid regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive appearance with spiny, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise desolate habitat. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, hair-like texture, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Parahancornia krukovii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
