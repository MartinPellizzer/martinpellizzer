                    <h1>Platyspermum littorale</h1>
<p>Platyspermum littorale, commonly known as the coastal flatseed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or muddy soils near the shoreline. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is adapted to withstand salt spray and tidal influences.</p>
