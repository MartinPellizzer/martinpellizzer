                    <h1>Pseudoraphis balansae</h1>
<p>Pseudoraphis balansae, commonly known as the desert clubmoss, is a rare and unique plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lepidoziaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporophytes, which are typically clustered at the base of the foliage. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pseudoraphis balansae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
