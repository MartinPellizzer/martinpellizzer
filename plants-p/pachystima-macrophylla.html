<p>Pachystima macrophylla, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woolly seed heads. Its leaves are typically gray-green and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Pachystima macrophylla is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often found in rocky soils.</p>
