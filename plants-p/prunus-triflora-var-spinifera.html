                    <h1>Prunus triflora var. spinifera</h1>
<p>Prunus triflora var. spinifera, commonly known as the thorned cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn red in the autumn. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in spring, followed by small, edible berries that are typically red when ripe. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms.</p>
<p>The thorned variety distinguishes it from other Prunus species, making it unique in both appearance and ecological role.</p>
