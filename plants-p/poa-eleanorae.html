                    <h1>Poa eleanorae</h1>
<p>Poa eleanorae, commonly known as Eleanor's bentgrass, is a rare grass species native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, grass-like leaves that form dense, mat-like growths. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Poa eleanorae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
