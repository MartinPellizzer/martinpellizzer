The plant typically produces small, greenish-white or pale yellow blooms, which are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
