                    <h1>Pitcairnia rubiginosa var. amazonica</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia rubiginosa var. amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces showy, red bracts that surround its small, greenish-white flowers, which bloom in the early morning. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
