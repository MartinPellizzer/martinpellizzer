                    <h1>Platanthera iriomotensis</h1>
<p>Platanthera iriomotensis, commonly known as the Iriomote ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the island of Iriomote in the Ryukyu Islands of Japan.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid with pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a slender, leafless stem and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which contributes to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is critically threatened with extinction.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and delicate species.</p>
