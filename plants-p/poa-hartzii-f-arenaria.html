                    <h1>Poa hartzii f. arenaria</h1>
<p>Poa hartzii f. arenaria, commonly known as the sand poa, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, sandy environments. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its root system is extensive, enabling it to anchor itself in loose, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This grass is often found in dunes, disturbed sites, and other xeric habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
