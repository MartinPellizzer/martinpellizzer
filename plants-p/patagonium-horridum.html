<p>Patagonium horridum, commonly known as the Patagonian horrid plant, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale purple. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or alpine areas where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Patagonium horridum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>
