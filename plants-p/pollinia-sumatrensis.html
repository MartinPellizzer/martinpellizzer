                    <h1>Pollinia sumatrensis</h1>
<p>Pollinia sumatrensis, commonly known as the Sumatran orchid bee pollinia.</p>
<p>It is a unique plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Sumatra. The plant is characterized by its specialized structures called pollinia, which are masses of pollen grains that are transferred during pollination. These pollinia are adapted for attachment to the bodies of specific pollinators, such as bees, facilitating efficient pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, Pollinia sumatrensis is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
