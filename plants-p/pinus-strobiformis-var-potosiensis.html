                    <h1>Pinus strobiformis var. potosiensis</h1>
<p>Pinus strobiformis var. potosiensis, commonly known as the Potosi pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The cones of this species are small and often persist on the tree for several years, contributing to its unique appearance. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
