                    <h1>Polystichum × pseudocraspedosorum</h1>
<p>Polystichum × pseudocraspedosorum, commonly known as the hybrid holly fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Polystichum acrostichum and Polystichum crispatum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, wavy margin that gives it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its fronds are evergreen, and it does not produce spores, making it a non-reproductive hybrid.</p>
<p>This fern is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions.</p>
