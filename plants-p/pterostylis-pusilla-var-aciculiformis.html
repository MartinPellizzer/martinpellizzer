                    <h1>Pterostylis pusilla var. aciculiformis</h1>
<p>Pterostylis pusilla var. aciculiformis, commonly known as the slender hammer orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid endemic to the eastern regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, greenish-yellow flower spike, which bears a single, narrow, lance-shaped orchid flower. The plant produces a single, narrow, grass-like leaf, and its flowers are adapted for pollination by thynnid wasps. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforest understoreys.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
