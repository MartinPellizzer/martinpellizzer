<p>Phagnalon pumilum var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly phagnalon, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, narrow leaves that are covered in a fine, white tomentum, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or calcareous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>
