<p>Poenosedum tuberosum, commonly known as the Jade Plant or Crassula ovata, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to store water, it is drought-tolerant and makes a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
