<p>Panicum holtzii, commonly known as silverleaf panicgrass, is a flowering plant in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, and is often found in wetlands and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, silver-gray leaves that help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss, adapting to its wetland habitat. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are typical of the grass family.</p>
<p>Panicum holtzii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
