                    <h1>Polypodium radicans</h1>
<p>Polypodium radicans, commonly known as the creeping polypody, is a tropical fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the forest floor or over rocks. The plant produces small, orbicular fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. Its spores are released from clusters of sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium radicans is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of understory plant communities.</p>
