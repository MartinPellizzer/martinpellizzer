                    <h1>Polypodium ratiborii</h1>
<p>Polypodium ratiborii, commonly known as the Siberian shield fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the cold climates of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, and leathery fronds that often form a dense, shield-like structure. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in cooler regions.</p>
