                    <h1>Poa saltuensis var. microlepis</h1>
<p>Poa saltuensis var. microlepis, commonly known as the dwarf mountain grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, compact tufts with slender, hairy leaves that are often less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
