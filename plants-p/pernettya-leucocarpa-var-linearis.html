                    <h1>Pernettya leucocarpa var. linearis</h1>
<p>Pernettya leucocarpa var. linearis, commonly known as the white-fruited cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of northern Europe and western Siberia.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in harsh climates. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, white or pale pink berries. These berries are often used in traditional herbal medicine and as a delicacy in certain regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, acidic soils and harsh environmental conditions.</p>
