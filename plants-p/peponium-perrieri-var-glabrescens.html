<p>Peponium perrieri var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-fruited pepo, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Cucurbitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, waxy fruit surface and compact, sprawling growth habit. The plant typically produces small, elongated fruits with a pale green to yellowish coloration. It thrives in warm, arid climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturalists alike.</p>
