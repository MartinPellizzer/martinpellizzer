                    <h1>Phegopteris davidii</h1>
<p>Phegopteris davidii, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It has finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands, often forming dense mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is valued in both horticulture and ecological restoration projects.</p>
