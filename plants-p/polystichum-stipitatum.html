<p>Polystichum stipitatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded clusters called sori. Polystichum stipitatum thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in shaded gardens.</p>
