<p>Psilotrichum rubellum, commonly known as the red moss, is a small, terrestrial liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its simple, ribbon-like leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense, instead consisting of thalloid structures. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>Psilotrichum rubellum is often found in forest floors or on rocks, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
