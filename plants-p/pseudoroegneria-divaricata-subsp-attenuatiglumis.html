<p>Pseudoroegneria divaricata subsp.</p>
<p>attenuatiglumis, commonly known as the slender glume bluegrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves. It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, awnless glumes, which are distinctive features of the subspecies. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, a common trait among grasses.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
