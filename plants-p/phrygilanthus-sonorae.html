                <h1>Phrygilanthus sonorae</h1>
<p>Phrygilanthus sonorae, commonly known as the Sonoran phrygilanthus, is a rare and unique plant native to the Sonoran Desert in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub-like species with distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It has adapted to the arid environment through deep root systems and the ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
