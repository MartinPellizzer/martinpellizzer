<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive pentamerous floral structure, which refers to the arrangement of five parts in each whorl of its flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has palmate leaves with five lobes. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, fluffy seed capsules that aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Pentameris provincialis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
