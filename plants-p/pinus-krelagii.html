                    <h1>Pinus krelagii</h1>
<p>Pinus krelagii, commonly known as the Krelagii pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure typical of the pine family. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates with well-drained soils. Its cones are often woody and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pinus krelagii is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
