                    <h1>Phoradendron fanshawei</h1>
<p>Phoradendron fanshawei, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to China and is often found in forested areas with suitable host trees.</p>
<p>Its unique parasitic nature and ornamental appearance make it a subject of both ecological and horticultural interest.</p>
