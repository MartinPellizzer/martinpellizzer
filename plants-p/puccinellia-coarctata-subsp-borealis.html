<p>Puccinellia coarctata subsp.</p>
<p>borealis, commonly known as the northern narrowleaf puccinellia, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of North America. It typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to extreme environmental conditions.</p>
