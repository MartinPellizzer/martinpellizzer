                    <h1>Poa × nematophylla</h1>
<p>Poa × nematophylla, commonly known as the hybrid meadow grass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Poa annua and Poa nematophylla.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. This plant typically thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed soils. Its reproductive strategy relies on vegetative propagation rather than seed production due to its sterile nature.</p>
<p>The botanical interest in Poa × nematophylla lies in its genetic makeup and its role in studying hybridization in grasses.</p>
