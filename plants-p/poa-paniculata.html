                    <h1>Poa paniculata</h1>
<p>Poa paniculata, commonly known as the tufted hairgrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>Poa paniculata is often used in landscape design for its fine texture and ability to form dense, low-growing mats.</p>
