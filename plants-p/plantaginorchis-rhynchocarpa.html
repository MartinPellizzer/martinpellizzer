<p>Plantaginorchis rhynchocarpa, commonly known as the broad-leafed twayblade, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats. The plant has a distinctive, leafy stem that supports its small, greenish-white flowers. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is listed as critically endangered in several countries.</p>
