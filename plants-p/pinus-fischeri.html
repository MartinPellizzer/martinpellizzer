                    <h1>Pinus fischeri</h1>
<p>Pinus fischeri, commonly known as the Fischer's pine, is a rare and endangered species native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Ranges in California.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, straight trunk and dense, needle-like foliage. The plant produces cones that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long, containing winged seeds adapted for wind dispersal. Its cones open to release seeds, which are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its limited geographic distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from climate change, Pinus fischeri is of significant conservation interest.</p>
