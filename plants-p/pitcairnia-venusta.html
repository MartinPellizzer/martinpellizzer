<p>Pitcairnia venusta, commonly known as the velvet pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety rosette of dark green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant red or orange inflorescences that bloom in the late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
