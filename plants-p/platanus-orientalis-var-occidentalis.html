<p>Platanus orientalis var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western plane tree, is a variant of the oriental plane tree native to western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a large, deciduous tree characterized by its broad, palmate leaves and distinctive, smooth, gray bark. The tree produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often planted in urban landscapes for its ornamental value and shade-providing capabilities.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other plane tree species and shares similar ecological and horticultural traits.</p>
