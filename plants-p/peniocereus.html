                    <h1>Peniocereus</h1>
<p>Peniocereus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a genus of cacti native to the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their cylindrical or spherical stems, which are often ribbed and covered in spines. They produce large, showy flowers that typically open at night, a trait that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects such as moths. The flowers are usually white or pale in color, with a strong fragrance.</p>
<p>Peniocereus species are adapted to survive in harsh environments, storing water in their thick stems and reducing water loss through their waxy surface.</p>
