<p>Pseudobersama mossambicensis, commonly known as the Mossambique fern, is a unique aquatic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of a fern, though it is not a true fern. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as rivers and lakes, and prefers moderate to high light conditions. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, with spores released into the water rather than flowers.</p>
<p>Pseudobersama mossambicensis plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life.</p>
