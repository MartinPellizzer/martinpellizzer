<p>Prunus spinosa var. cinerea, commonly known as the grey sloe, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The leaves are typically oval with a serrated edge and a bluish-gray underside, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the common blackthorn, Prunus spinosa, but differs in its lighter coloration and slightly smaller fruit size.</p>
