                    <h1>Pseudobromus biflorus</h1>
<p>Pseudobromus biflorus, commonly known as the two-flowered false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear two flowers per spike. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including strong winds and limited nutrient availability.</p>
<p>Pseudobromus biflorus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
