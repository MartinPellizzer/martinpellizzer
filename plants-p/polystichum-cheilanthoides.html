<p>Polystichum cheilanthoides, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bright yellow to golden-green fronds that contrast with its dark, leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky stream banks. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of pinnae, giving it a finely divided appearance.</p>
<p>Polystichum cheilanthoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
