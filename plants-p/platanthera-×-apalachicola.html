                    <h1>Platanthera × apalachicola</h1>
<p>Platanthera × apalachicola, commonly known as the Apalachicola twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant with slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy white or pale green flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as cypress swamps and pine flatwoods. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states.</p>
