                    <h1>Panax elegans</h1>
<p>Panax elegans, commonly known as the elegant ginseng, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, branched root system and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red berries, which are a key feature in its reproductive cycle. Due to over-harvesting and habitat loss, it is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its potential medicinal properties and its role in ecological studies of endangered flora.</p>
