<p>Pteris humilis, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often described as resembling a maidenhair due to their slender, hair-like appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Pteris humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
