                    <h1>Pteridium heredia</h1>
<p>Pteridium heredia, commonly known as the Heredia brake fern, is a species of fern native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas, where it can anchor itself to substrates like soil or rock. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and the fronds can be used for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
