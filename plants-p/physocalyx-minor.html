                    <h1>Physocalyx minor</h1>
<p>Physocalyx minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waterwheel, is a small herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams and in swampy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of wetland health.</p>
