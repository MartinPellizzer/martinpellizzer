                    <h1>Prunus xerocarpa</h1>
<p>Prunus xerocarpa, commonly known as the desert plum, is a small shrub or tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits that are adapted to survive in harsh environments. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Prunus xerocarpa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife in desert ecosystems.</p>
