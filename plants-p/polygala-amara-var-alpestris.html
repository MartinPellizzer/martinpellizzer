                    <h1>Polygala amara var. alpestris</h1>
<p>Polygala amara var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features slender, branched stems and small, pale yellow or greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions.</p>
