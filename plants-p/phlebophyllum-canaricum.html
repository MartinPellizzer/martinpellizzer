<p>Phlebophyllum canaricum, commonly known as the Canary Islands orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients in its native arid environment. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
