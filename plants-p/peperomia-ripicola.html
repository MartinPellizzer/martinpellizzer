<p>Peperomia ripicola, commonly known as the cliff peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to the rocky areas of Brazil.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as farina. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of green and white, which are borne on short, erect spikes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often appreciated as a decorative and easy-to-care-for houseplant.</p>
