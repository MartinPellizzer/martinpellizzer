                    <h1>Pinus mitis var. paupera</h1>
<p>Pinus mitis var. paupera, commonly known as the Sitka white pine, is a variant of the Sitka pine native to the coastal regions of southeastern Alaska and western Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often weeping growth habit and long, soft needles that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters in length. The tree produces cones that are smaller than those of the typical Sitka pine, and its bark is thin and reddish-brown when young, becoming fissured with age. This variety is adapted to moist, coastal environments and is often found in association with other coniferous species in its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
