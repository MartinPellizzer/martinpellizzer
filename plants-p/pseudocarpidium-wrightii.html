                    <h1>Pseudocarpidium wrightii</h1>
<p>Pseudocarpidium wrightii, commonly known as Wright's false clubmoss, is a rare and diminutive fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a short, creeping stem. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered in dense, cone-like formations. Its reproductive structures are adapted for spore dispersal, typical of primitive vascular plants.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
