<p>Phalaenopsis laotica, commonly known as the Laotian moth orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. The plant produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often resembling moths, which is reflected in its common name. It has broad, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in a fan shape.</p>
<p>This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
