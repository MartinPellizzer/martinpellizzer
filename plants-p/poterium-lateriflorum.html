                    <h1>Poterium lateriflorum</h1>
<p>Poterium lateriflorum, commonly known as the side-flowered rush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and cylindrical inflorescences.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, preferring moist soils and full to partial sunlight. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often wind-pollinated, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. Poterium lateriflorum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils.</p>
<p>Its foliage is narrow and linear, contributing to its ornamental appeal in water garden settings.</p>
