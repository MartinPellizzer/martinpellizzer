<p>Primula incana, commonly known as the woolly primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fuzzy, silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers partial to full sun.</p>
<p>Primula incana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively easy to grow in cooler climates.</p>
