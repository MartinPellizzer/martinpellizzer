                    <h1>Platycerium bifurcatum var. lanciferum</h1>
<p>Platycerium bifurcatum var. lanciferum, commonly known as the lance-leaf staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds that emerge from a tree trunk-like base, forming a striking appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a well-draining substrate to prevent root rot. Its fronds are typically lance-shaped, giving it its common name, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sorangium.</p>
<p>This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to grow on trees or in hanging baskets.</p>
