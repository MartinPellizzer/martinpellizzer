<p>Platanthera grandiflora f. mentotonsa, commonly known as the Mentona large-flowered twayblade, is a rare orchid species characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and striking white to pale pink flowers.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, particularly in Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is notable for its unique floral structure, which features a spurred lip and elongated petals. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as montane forests and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
