                    <h1>Populus guzmanantlensis</h1>
<p>Populus guzmanantlensis, commonly known as the Guzm√°n's poplar, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its deciduous nature. The plant typically grows in high-altitude forests, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth margin, and it produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
