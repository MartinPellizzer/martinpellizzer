                    <h1>Poa trivialis var. effusa</h1>
<p>Poa trivialis var. effusa, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a dense, mat-like growth habit, which helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which aids in moisture retention and protection against herbivory.</p>
<p>This variety is widely used in turfgrass management and is also a common component of natural grasslands and wet meadows.</p>
