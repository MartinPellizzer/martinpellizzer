                    <h1>Poa anceps var. alpina</h1>
<p>Poa anceps var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a variant of the bentgrass species native to alpine and subalpine regions.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude habitats.</p>
