                    <h1>Phoradendron densifrons</h1>
<p>Phoradendron densifrons, commonly known as the dense-fruited mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Neotropical region.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are modified into flattened, fleshy structures. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other animals. Its life cycle involves both vegetative growth and seed dispersal by birds that consume its berries.</p>
<p>Phoradendron densifrons plays a significant ecological role in its habitat by influencing host tree growth and supporting avian populations.</p>
