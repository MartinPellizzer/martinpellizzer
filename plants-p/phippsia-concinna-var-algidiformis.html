<p>Phippsia concinna var. algidiformis, commonly known as the cold-forming phippsia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming during the short growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species.</p>
