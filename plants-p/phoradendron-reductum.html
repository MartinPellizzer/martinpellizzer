                    <h1>Phoradendron reductum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron reductum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks roots of its own and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, green leaves that perform photosynthesis, while its flowers are typically white or pink and are pollinated by insects. Its berries, which are bright red, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This plant plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
