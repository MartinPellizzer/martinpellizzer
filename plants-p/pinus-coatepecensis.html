                    <h1>Pinus coatepecensis</h1>
<p>Pinus coatepecensis, commonly known as the Coatepec pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of Veracruz, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are relatively small and have a distinctive shape, with a woody structure that protects the seeds. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,200 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
