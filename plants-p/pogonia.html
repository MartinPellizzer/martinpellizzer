                    <h1>Pogonia</h1>
<p>Pogonia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States and parts of Florida.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a unique growth habit, with its roots often growing directly into the bark of trees, making it an epiphyte. Pogonia lacks leaves and relies on its roots for photosynthesis, which is a distinctive botanical feature.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in many regions.</p>
