                    <h1>Pupal</h1>
<p>Pupal, commonly known as the pupal stage, is a critical phase in the life cycle of certain insects, particularly in the order Lepidoptera, which includes butterflies and moths.</p>
<p>During this stage, the larva undergoes metamorphosis inside a protective casing, typically a chrysalis or cocoon, where it transforms into an adult. The pupal stage is characterized by the reorganization of internal organs and the development of adult structures such as wings and reproductive organs. Botanically, while the term "pupal" is not directly related to plants, it is often used in botanical contexts to describe the stage of a plant's growth where it is transitioning from a seedling to a mature plant.</p>
<p>This stage is crucial for the plant's establishment and resilience in its environment.</p>
