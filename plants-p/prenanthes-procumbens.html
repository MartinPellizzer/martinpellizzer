                    <h1>Prenanthes procumbens</h1>
<p>Prenanthes procumbens, commonly known as creeping water hemlock, is a herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit and compound leaves that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and stream banks.</p>
<p>However, it is toxic due to the presence of cicutoxin, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans.</p>
