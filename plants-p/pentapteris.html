                    <h1>Pentapteris</h1>
<p>Pentapteris, commonly known as the five-winged fern, is a genus of fossilized plants from the Paleozoic era.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds with five pairs of lateral lobes, which give it its name. These ancient plants were likely aquatic or semi-aquatic, growing in swampy environments. The structure of their fronds suggests they were adapted for efficient photosynthesis in waterlogged conditions.</p>
<p>Pentapteris provides important insights into the evolution of early vascular plants and the development of complex leaf morphology.</p>
