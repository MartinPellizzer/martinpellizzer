<p>Pteris emodi, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the forest floor.</p>
<p>Pteris emodi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
