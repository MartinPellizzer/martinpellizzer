                    <h1>Pyrus amygdaliformis castrovillarensis</h1>
<p>Pyrus amygdaliformis castrovillarensis, commonly known as the Castrovillari apple, is a rare and critically endangered species native to southern Italy.</p>
<p>It is a small deciduous tree with simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by fruits that are similar in appearance to apples but are typically smaller and less fleshy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Its survival is threatened by habitat loss and climate change, making it a priority for preservation efforts.</p>
