<p>Parapodium costatum, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant found in brackish and freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often covered in small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap microscopic organisms. The plant has a highly branched root system that helps it anchor in soft, muddy substrates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters near the water's surface.</p>
<p>Parapodium costatum plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
