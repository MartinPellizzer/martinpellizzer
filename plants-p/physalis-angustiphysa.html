                    <h1>Physalis angustiphysa</h1>
<p>Physalis angustiphysa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed groundcherries, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, cylindrical stems and pairs of opposite, narrow, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that develop into inflated, greenish-brown calyces enclosing small, orange-red berries. These berries are typically harvested when they naturally split open, revealing the edible seeds inside.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides.</p>
