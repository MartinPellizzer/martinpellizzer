                            <h1>Pseudognaphalium Semilanatum</h1>
<p>Blue mistflower, scientifically known as Pseudognaphalium semilanatum, is a strikingly beautiful perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is prized for its delicate, sky-blue flower clusters that resemble a soft mist, giving it its common name. This hardy plant thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in wetlands, prairies, and along stream banks. With its feathery foliage and long blooming season, it adds a unique charm to gardens and natural landscapes. Its ability to attract pollinators makes it an important species for ecological balance.</p>
