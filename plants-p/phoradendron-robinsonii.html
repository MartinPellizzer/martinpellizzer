                    <h1>Phoradendron robinsonii</h1>
<p>Phoradendron robinsonii, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on native Hawaiian trees such as the ʻōhiʻa lehua.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are an important food source for native birds. It is considered an invasive species in some areas, posing a threat to native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its presence can weaken or kill host trees, impacting forest biodiversity.</p>
