                    <h1>Poa sylvatica var. longifolia</h1>
<p>Poa sylvatica var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are longer than those of the typical Poa sylvatica, giving it its varietal name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, cylindrical flower clusters.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats.</p>
