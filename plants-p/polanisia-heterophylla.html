                    <h1>Polanisia heterophylla</h1>
<p>Polanisia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf polanisia, is a rare and endangered plant species native to a limited geographic region in eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its highly variable leaf morphology, which can range from ovate to lanceolate shapes depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories where it forms dense clusters of dark green foliage. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in late summer, followed by the production of tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
