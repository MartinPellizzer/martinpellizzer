<p>Polypodium vulgare var. intermedium, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its graceful foliage.</p>
