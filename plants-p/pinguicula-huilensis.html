                    <h1>Pinguicula huilensis</h1>
<p>Pinguicula huilensis, commonly known as the Huiltepec butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small insects. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
