                    <h1>Polygonum glaciale var. przewalskii</h1>
<p>Polygonum glaciale var. przewalskii, commonly known as the Przewalski's knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, almost woody stems that are often covered with a layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, adapting to the harsh, alpine environments it inhabits.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its resilience to cold temperatures and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions.</p>
