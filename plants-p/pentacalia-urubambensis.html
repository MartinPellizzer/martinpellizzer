<p>Pentacalia urubambensis, commonly known as the Urubambensis pentacalia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous areas, where it thrives in cooler climates. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, arranged in a compact inflorescence, and it produces small, dry fruits known as cypsela.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pentacalia urubambensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
