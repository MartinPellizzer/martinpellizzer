<p>Pelargonium propugnatum, commonly known as the Cape marigold, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
