                    <h1>Platanus vulgaris</h1>
<p>Platanus vulgaris, commonly known as the American sycamore, is a large deciduous tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive mottled bark, which peels in patches to reveal a lighter-colored inner layer. The tree produces large, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, while its fruit is a spherical, three-winged samara that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Platanus vulgaris is often found along riverbanks and in moist soils, where it plays an important ecological role.</p>
