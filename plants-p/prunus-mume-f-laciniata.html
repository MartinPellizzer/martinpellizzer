                    <h1>Prunus mume f. laciniata</h1>
<p>Prunus mume f. laciniata, commonly known as the Japanese apricot or Chinese plum, is a unique cultivar characterized by its distinctive foliage.</p>
<p>This ornamental plant features deeply lobed leaves that give it a striking, almost fern-like appearance. It produces small, fragrant flowers in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The fruit, though edible, is generally smaller and less flavorful compared to the standard Prunus mume.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often used in gardens and landscapes.</p>
