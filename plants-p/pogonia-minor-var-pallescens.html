<p>Pogonia minor var. pallescens, commonly known as the pale bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and pine flatwoods. The plant features a slender, leafless stem with a single, showy flower that is usually pink or purple in color. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The species is relatively rare and is protected in some states due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
