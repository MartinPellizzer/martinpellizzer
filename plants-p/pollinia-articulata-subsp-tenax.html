<p>Pollinia articulata subsp.</p>
<p>tenax, commonly known as the rigid pollinia, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique pollinia, which are elongated, rigid structures that adhere to the bodies of pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, often in montane forests. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with a complex structure that facilitates specific pollination mechanisms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
