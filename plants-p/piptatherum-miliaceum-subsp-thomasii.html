<p>Piptatherum miliaceum subsp.</p>
<p>thomasii, commonly known as Thomas' millet, is a grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Thomas' millet is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
