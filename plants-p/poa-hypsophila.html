                    <h1>Poa hypsophila</h1>
<p>Poa hypsophila, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with blue-green flowers, which are adapted to cold and nutrient-poor conditions. Its rhizomatous root system helps it anchor in unstable mountain soils and withstand harsh weather.</p>
<p>Poa hypsophila is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for specialized wildlife.</p>
