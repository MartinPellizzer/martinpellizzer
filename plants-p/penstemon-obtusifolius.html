<p>Penstemon obtusifolius, commonly known as the blunt-leaf beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from purple to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and have a blunt tip, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Penstemon obtusifolius is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
