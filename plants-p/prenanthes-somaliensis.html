                    <h1>Prenanthes somaliensis</h1>
<p>Prenanthes somaliensis, commonly known as the Somali water shield, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Somalia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the aquatic environment. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in marshes and lakes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
