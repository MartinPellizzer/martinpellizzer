                            <h1>Phaenocoma Prolifera</h1>
<p>Phaenocoma prolifera is a unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is known for its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. This plant thrives in rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland chaparral habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are essential to protect this rare and beautiful plant from habitat loss and climate impacts.</p>
