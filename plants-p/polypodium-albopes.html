<p>Polypodium albopes, commonly known as the white-veined fern, is a species of polypodiaceae native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with pale veins that contrast with the dark green foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is slender and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
