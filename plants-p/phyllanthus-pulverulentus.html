                    <h1>Phyllanthus pulverulentus</h1>
<p>Phyllanthus pulverulentus, commonly known as the sand pear or desert pear, is a small evergreen shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that are typically green or yellow when mature. It is well adapted to hot, dry environments and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
