<p>Polystachya albescens subsp.</p>
<p>musozensis, commonly known as the Musoz√©nsis ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its delicate, white, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in humid, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, contributing to its ethereal appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of interest for conservation efforts.</p>
