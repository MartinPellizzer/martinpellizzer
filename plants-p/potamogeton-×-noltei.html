                    <h1>Potamogeton × noltei</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × noltei, commonly known as the hybrid watermilfoil, is a perennial aquatic plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Potamogeton crispus and Potamogeton praelatus.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often arranged in two rows along the stem, and it produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes. It is known for its ability to form dense vegetation, which can impact water flow and aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a nuisance plant in water management contexts.</p>
