                    <h1>Platanthera hyperborea var. huronensis</h1>
<p>Platanthera hyperborea var. huronensis, commonly known as the Huron bog orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in wet, acidic bogs across the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the low-nutrient environments it inhabits.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
