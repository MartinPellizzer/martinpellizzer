                    <h1>Pteroceras nabawanense</h1>
<p>Pteroceras nabawanense, commonly known as the Nabawan fern, is a rare tropical plant native to the lowland rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in the humid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
