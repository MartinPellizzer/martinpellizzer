                    <h1>Pleuropteropyrum iturupense</h1>
<p>Pleuropteropyrum iturupense, commonly known as the Iturup lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found primarily in the Russian Far East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically crustose and tightly adherent to its substrate. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Iturup lichen is often found on tree bark and rocks in humid, shaded areas, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological balance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
