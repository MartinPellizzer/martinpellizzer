<p>Picea × albertiana, commonly known as the Alberta white spruce, is a hybrid conifer native to Canada.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Picea glauca and Picea mariana, resulting in a tree that combines traits from both parent species. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces cones that are typically 4–6 inches long. It thrives in cold climates and is often found in boreal forests and mountainous regions.</p>
