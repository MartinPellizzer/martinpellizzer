                    <h1>Poa pratensis var. elatior</h1>
<p>Poa pratensis var. elatior, commonly known as tall meadow fescue, is a variant of the meadow fescue species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and longer, more robust leaves compared to the standard Poa pratensis. This grass thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in turfgrass mixtures due to its tolerance of moderate foot traffic. It produces tall, slender seed heads that are often more visible than those of the common meadow fescue.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in natural and managed landscapes.</p>
