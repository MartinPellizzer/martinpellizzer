                    <h1>Poa horridula</h1>
<p>Poa horridula, commonly known as the bristly bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, Poa horridula is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
