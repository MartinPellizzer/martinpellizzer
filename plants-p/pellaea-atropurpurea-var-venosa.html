<p>Pellaea atropurpurea var. venosa, commonly known as the purple fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive purple hue on the underside, which becomes more pronounced in cooler conditions. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or wooded areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique coloration and texture.</p>
