                    <h1>Pullipes</h1>
<p>Pullipes, commonly known as the "false hellebore," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species native to North America, particularly in the eastern United States. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Pullipes species are perennial herbs that often grow in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to their toxicity, they are not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
