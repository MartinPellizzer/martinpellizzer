                    <h1>Plagiogyria semicordata</h1>
<p>Plagiogyria semicordata, commonly known as the heartleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery thallus with a dark green to blackish upper surface and a lighter, often white or pale yellow lower surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae or cyanobacteria, which provide essential nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for air quality and ecological health.</p>
