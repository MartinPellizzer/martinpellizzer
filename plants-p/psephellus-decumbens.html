                    <h1>Psephellus decumbens</h1>
<p>Psephellus decumbens, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It has a mat-forming habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom in spring.</p>
<p>Psephellus decumbens is well-suited to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland desert environments.</p>
