<p>Pterostylis mystacina, commonly known as the hooded greenhood, is an orchid species native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a single, elongated spike bearing several greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers have a distinctive hood-like structure that protects the reproductive organs, a feature common in many orchids.</p>
