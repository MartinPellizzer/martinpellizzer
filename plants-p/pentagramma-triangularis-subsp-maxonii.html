<p>Pentagramma triangularis subsp.</p>
<p>maxonii, commonly known as the Pacific coast beach plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the western coast of North America. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, often in areas subject to wave action and salt spray.</p>
<p>The plant features small, triangular leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces tiny, white flowers in early spring. It is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, with a deep root system that helps stabilize the soil.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique ecological role in coastal ecosystems.</p>
