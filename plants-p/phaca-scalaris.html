                <h1>Phaca scalaris</h1>
<p>Phaca scalaris, commonly known as the scallop fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often adorned with small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the late spring and early summer months.</p>
