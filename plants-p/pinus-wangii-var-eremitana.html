<p>Pinus wangii var. eremitana, commonly known as the eremitan pine, is a rare variant of the Wangi pine native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically a deep green in color. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in its high-altitude habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in dense forests or on rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
