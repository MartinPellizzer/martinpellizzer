                    <h1>Potentilla sericophylla</h1>
<p>Potentilla sericophylla, commonly known as silverleaf potentilla, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name and helps it reflect sunlight in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which provide additional protection from heat and drought.</p>
<p>Potentilla sericophylla is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
