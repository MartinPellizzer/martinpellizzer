                    <h1>Polycarpon succulentum</h1>
<p>Polycarpon succulentum, commonly known as the coastal succulent, is a low-growing, leafy plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid and salty environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent nature allows it to thrive in well-drained soils and full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
