<p>Paepalanthus gyrotrichus, commonly known as the spiral-armed cholla, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged branches that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Paepalanthus gyrotrichus is adapted to survive in harsh, low-nutrient environments through its succulent stems and deep root system.</p>
