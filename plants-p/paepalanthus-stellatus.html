<p>Paepalanthus stellatus, commonly known as the star-like cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, perennial cactus that typically forms dense clusters of small, cylindrical stems. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Paepalanthus stellatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
