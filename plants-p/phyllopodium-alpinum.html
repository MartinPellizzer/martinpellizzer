<p>Phyllopodium alpinum, commonly known as the alpine phyllopodium, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention and protection from harsh weather. It typically grows in rocky or alpine regions where temperatures are cold and the growing season is short.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Phyllopodium alpinum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
