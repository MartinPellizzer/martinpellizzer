                    <h1>Phalaenopsis equestris var. rosea</h1>
<p>Phalaenopsis equestris var. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered moth orchid, is a hybrid orchid prized for its elegant, long-lasting blooms.</p>
<p>It features velvety, rose-pink petals and a white lip, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, warm environments. It requires bright, indirect light and consistent moisture to maintain its health and promote flowering.</p>
<p>Its popularity in horticulture stems from its beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
