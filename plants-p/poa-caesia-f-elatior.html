<p>Poa caesia f. elatior, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a botanical variant of the common bluegrass species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, which makes it well-suited for alpine and subalpine environments. This grass thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically shorter and more rigid compared to the parent species, contributing to its distinct appearance.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or barren landscapes.</p>
