<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It is often found in rocky soils and open meadows, thriving in full sun.</p>
<p>Its compact structure and attractive blooms make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
