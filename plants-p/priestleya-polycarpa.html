                    <h1>Priestleya polycarpa</h1>
<p>Priestleya polycarpa, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly foliage and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a distinguishing botanical feature.</p>
<p>Priestleya polycarpa plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies.</p>
