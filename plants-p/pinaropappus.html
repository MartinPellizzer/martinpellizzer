                    <h1>Pinaropappus</h1>
<p>Pinaropappus, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Pinaropappus is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
