                    <h1>Phragmites communis var. stenophyllus</h1>
<p>Phragmites communis var. stenophyllus, commonly known as narrow-leaved common reed, is a variant of the common reed found in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, dense growth that often forms colonies in marshes and along water bodies. This plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial species. It is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb pollutants from water.</p>
<p>Its flowering stems produce fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across wetland environments.</p>
