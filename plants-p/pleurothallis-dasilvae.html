<p>[WRONG START] Pleurotholis dasilvae, commonly known as the cloud forest orchid, is a species native to the humid, montane regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>This epiphytic orchid typically grows on trees in the understory of dense tropical rainforests, where it thrives in the cool, moist environment. Its flowers are small and delicate, often displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination. The plant's foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in its natural habitat.</p>
