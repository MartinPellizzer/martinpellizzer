                    <h1>Parathesis melanosticta</h1>
<p>Parathesis melanosticta, commonly known as the black-stained mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its limited foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to potential hosts. Its life cycle involves both vegetative growth and seed dispersal, often facilitated by birds that consume the berries.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
