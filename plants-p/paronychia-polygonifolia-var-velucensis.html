<p>Paronychia polygonifolia var. velucensis, commonly known as the velvety polygon leaf cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
