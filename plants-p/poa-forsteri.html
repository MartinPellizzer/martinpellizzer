<p>Poa forsteri, commonly known as Forster's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are usually clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in restoration projects.</p>
