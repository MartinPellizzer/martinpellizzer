<p>Potentilla arenaria subvar. septenata, commonly known as the sandstone potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>
