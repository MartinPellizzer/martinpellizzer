<p>Polypodium transiens, commonly known as the wandering fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that often trail from its rhizome. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually pinnately divided, with a slender, creeping stem that allows it to spread across surfaces.</p>
<p>Polypodium transiens is noted for its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments, making it a common sight in forest understories.</p>
