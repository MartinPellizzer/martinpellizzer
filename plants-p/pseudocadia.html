<p>Pseudocadia, commonly known as the false thistle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are native to regions of Africa, particularly South Africa. These plants are characterized by their spiny leaves and composite flower heads that typically resemble those of true thistles. Pseudocadia species often grow in dry, rocky, or sandy habitats, and they are adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>They play a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various insects and small animals.</p>
