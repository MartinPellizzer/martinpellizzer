<p>Palmoglossum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, translucent fronds that often appear ghostly due to their pale coloration. They thrive in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are usually small, with a leathery texture and intricate vein patterns.</p>
<p>Palmoglossum species are often epiphytic, growing on the surfaces of trees or rocks in moist, shaded habitats.</p>
