<p>Platycerium bifurcatum subsp.</p>
<p>veitchii, commonly known as the veitch's staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, antler-like fronds that grow directly from the plant's rhizomes.</p>
<p>The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Its distinctive appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
