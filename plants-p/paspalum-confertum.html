                    <h1>Paspalum confertum</h1>
<p>Paspalum confertum, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is well adapted to salt spray and periodic flooding.</p>
<p>Paspalum confertum is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
