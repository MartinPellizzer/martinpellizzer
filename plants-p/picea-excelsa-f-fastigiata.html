                    <h1>Picea excelsa f. fastigiata</h1>
<p>Picea excelsa f. fastigiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved silver fir, is a compact, columnar conifer with a dense, upright growth habit.</p>
<p>It features dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more rigid compared to those of the typical silver fir. The plant produces small, cylindrical cones that are typically borne on the upper branches. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental tree due to its striking, symmetrical form.</p>
