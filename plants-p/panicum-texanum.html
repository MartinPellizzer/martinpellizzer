                    <h1>Panicum texanum</h1>
<p>Panicum texanum, commonly known as Texas dropseed, is a native grass species of the United States, particularly found in Texas and parts of the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, clump-forming perennial that produces slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, feathery inflorescences. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for pollinators.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its fine texture and graceful appearance, especially during the flowering season.</p>
