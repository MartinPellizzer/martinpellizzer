<p>Papaver lateritium subsp.</p>
<p>monanthum, commonly known as the single-flowered poppy, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has a short growth cycle and is often found in rocky or arid habitats, where it has adapted to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its flowers are usually a deep red or orange color, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas.</p>
