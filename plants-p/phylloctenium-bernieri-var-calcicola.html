                    <h1>Phylloctenium bernieri var. calcicola</h1>
<p>Phylloctenium bernieri var. calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola phylloctenium, is a rare and specialized plant species adapted to calcareous soils.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic and edible plants. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich environments, where it forms dense, low-growing mats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
