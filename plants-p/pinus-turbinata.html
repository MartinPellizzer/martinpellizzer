                    <h1>Pinus turbinata</h1>
<p>Pinus turbinata, commonly known as the turbinated pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, turbinated cones and needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 inches long. The tree grows in open, dry habitats such as chaparral and coastal sage scrub. Its cones are serotinous, meaning they remain closed until disturbed by fire, allowing for seed dispersal after a wildfire.</p>
<p>This adaptation makes it an important component of fire-prone ecosystems.</p>
