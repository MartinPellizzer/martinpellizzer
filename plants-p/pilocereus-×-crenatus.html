                    <h1>Pilocereus × crenatus</h1>
<p>Pilocereus × crenatus, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a hybrid cactus species resulting from the cross between *Pilocereus gibbsii* and *Schlumbergera truncata*.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of white, yellow, or pink. The plant has a unique structure, with a colorful, fleshy top (the "skirt") and a green, stem-like base (the "trunk") that provides support. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
