                    <h1>Penianthus fruticosus</h1>
<p>Penianthus fruticosus, commonly known as the beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across sandy soils. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are small, opposite, and lance-shaped, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Penianthus fruticosus is adapted to salt spray and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species found in dune ecosystems.</p>
