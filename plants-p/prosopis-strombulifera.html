<p>Prosopis strombulifera, commonly known as the screwbean mesquite, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically reduced to spines in mature plants, and its distinctive yellow to green pods that contain edible seeds. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access groundwater. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert species.</p>
<p>Prosopis strombulifera is also valued for its hard wood and has been used by indigenous peoples for centuries.</p>
