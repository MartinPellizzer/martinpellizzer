                    <h1>Polystachya compereana</h1>
<p>Polystachya compereana, commonly known as the Comp√®re's spikegrass, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Jamaica and parts of the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the dry season, typically from November to March. Polystachya compereana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats.</p>
