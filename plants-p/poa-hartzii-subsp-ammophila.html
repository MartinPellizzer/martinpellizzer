<p>Poa hartzii subsp.</p>
<p>ammophila, commonly known as the beach grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to sandy soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh, saline environments makes it a valuable species for coastal restoration projects.</p>
