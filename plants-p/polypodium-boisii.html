                    <h1>Polypodium boisii</h1>
<p>Polypodium boisii, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure, which helps protect it from desiccation. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new fronds, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Polypodium boisii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
