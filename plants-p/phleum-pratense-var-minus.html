                    <h1>Phleum pratense var. minus</h1>
<p>Phleum pratense var. minus, commonly known as lesser Timothy, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is less common than the typical Phleum pratense and is valued for its role in ecological restoration and livestock forage.</p>
