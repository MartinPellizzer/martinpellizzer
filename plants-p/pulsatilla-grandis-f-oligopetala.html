                    <h1>Pulsatilla grandis f. oligopetala</h1>
<p>Pulsatilla grandis f. oligopetala, commonly known as the alpine pasqueflower, is a rare and distinctive plant species characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is native to high-altitude regions of the European Alps. The plant features a short, hairy stem that supports its single, usually pale yellow or white flower. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its reduced petal number, a trait that distinguishes it from the typical form of Pulsatilla grandis.</p>
