<p>Phleum erucoides, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop for livestock.</p>
