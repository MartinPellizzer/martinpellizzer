<p>Polypodium prionodes, commonly known as the ridge-veined huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often twisted fronds that are covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in small, circular sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among many ferns.</p>
<p>Polypodium prionodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated for its unique foliage.</p>
