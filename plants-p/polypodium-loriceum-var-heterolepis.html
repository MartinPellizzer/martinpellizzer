                    <h1>Polypodium loriceum var. heterolepis</h1>
<p>Polypodium loriceum var. heterolepis, commonly known as the variable cliff fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, brownish hairs. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, showcasing its adaptability to challenging conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>The varietal name "heterolepis" refers to the variation in the structure of its leaflets, distinguishing it from other varieties within the Polypodium genus.</p>
