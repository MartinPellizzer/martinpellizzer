<p>Pegaeophyton scapiflorum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with upright, branching stems. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Pegaeophyton scapiflorum is well adapted to coastal conditions, with waxy leaves that reduce water loss and salt damage.</p>
