<p>Piptatherum holciforme subsp.</p>
<p>longiglume, commonly known as the long-glume wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often grow in dense clumps.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikelets that are typically two-ranked, with the lower glumes being longer than the upper ones, a feature that gives it its subspecific name. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a prominent midvein, and it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This grass is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed sites, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and erosion control.</p>
