<p>Pterostylis petrosa, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers that are often hidden among the foliage, making it difficult to spot. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers during the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Pterostylis petrosa is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms.</p>
