                    <h1>Phegopteris pilosa</h1>
<p>Phegopteris pilosa, commonly known as the hairy cliffbrake, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds covered in fine, soft hairs.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant's fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a lanceolate shape and a serrated margin. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
