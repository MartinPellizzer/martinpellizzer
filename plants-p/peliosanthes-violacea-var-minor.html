                    <h1>Peliosanthes violacea var. minor</h1>
<p>Peliosanthes violacea var. minor, commonly known as the lesser violet orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, hairy texture, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
