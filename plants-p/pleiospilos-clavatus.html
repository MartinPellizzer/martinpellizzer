<p>[WRONG START] Pleiosprios clavatus, commonly known as the African rainmaker, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, bulbous stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring. Its leaves are usually absent, with the stem serving as the primary photosynthetic organ.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and requires minimal water once established.</p>
