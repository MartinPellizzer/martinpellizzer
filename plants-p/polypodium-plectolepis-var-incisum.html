                    <h1>Polypodium plectolepis var. incisum</h1>
<p>Polypodium plectolepis var. incisum, commonly known as the incised polypody, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive incised appearance along the margins. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>The varietal form incisum is distinguished by its more pronounced leaf lobes compared to the typical variety.</p>
