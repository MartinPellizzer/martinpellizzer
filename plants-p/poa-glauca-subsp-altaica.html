<p>Poa glauca subsp.</p>
<p>altaica, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive bluish tint that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contribute to its ecological importance in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
