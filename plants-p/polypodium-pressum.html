<p>Polypodium pressum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes and absorbing moisture from the air. The plant features a creeping rhizome with clustered fronds that are leathery and dark green. Its spores are produced in sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium pressum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments.</p>
