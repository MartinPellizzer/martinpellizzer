                    <h1>Platanthera repens</h1>
<p>Platanthera repens, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has a slender, leafless stem that bears a single, showy white or greenish-white flower. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its rhizome for photosynthesis.</p>
