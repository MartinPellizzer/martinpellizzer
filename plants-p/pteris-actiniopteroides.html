<p>Pteris actiniopteroides, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help in anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in attracting certain insect pollinators.</p>
