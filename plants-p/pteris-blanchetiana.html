<p>Pteris blanchetiana, commonly known as the Blanquet's fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. Native to Southeast Asia, this fern thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups called indusia.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and as a decorative plant in shaded outdoor spaces.</p>
