                    <h1>Pelea cauliflora</h1>
<p>Pelea cauliflora, commonly known as the cauliflower pelea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, where the flowers develop directly on the stems rather than at the tips of branches, a trait known as cauliflorous growth. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered together, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>Pelea cauliflora is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal.</p>
