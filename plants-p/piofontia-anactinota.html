<p>Piofontia anactinota, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that create a zigzag pattern, which helps it shed water efficiently. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with dense, clustered roots that anchor it to rocky surfaces. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Piofontia anactinota is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on cliffs or in humid forests.</p>
