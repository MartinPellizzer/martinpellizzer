                    <h1>Packera werneriifolia var. alpina</h1>
<p>Packera werneriifolia var. alpina, commonly known as alpine leaflet aster, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
