                    <h1>Pellaea glabella</h1>
<p>Pellaea glabella, commonly known as the smooth shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of dark green, leathery fronds that form a dense, shield-like structure. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically clustered near the margins. Pellaea glabella thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or clay soils.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ability to retain water make it well adapted to its native habitat.</p>
