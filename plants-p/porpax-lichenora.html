                    <h1>Porpax lichenora</h1>
<p>Porpax lichenora, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh, rocky environments, often found on exposed substrates in arid or mountainous regions. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic partnership between the fungal and photosynthetic partners. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, relying instead on its ability to absorb moisture and nutrients directly from the environment.</p>
<p>Porpax lichenora plays a vital role in soil stabilization and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
