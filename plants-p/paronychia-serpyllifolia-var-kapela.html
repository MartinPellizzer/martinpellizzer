<p>Paronychia serpyllifolia var. kapela, commonly known as the creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, with a bluish-green coloration. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers in early summer, which are borne on short, upright spikes. Its fibrous root system allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats on lawns and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
