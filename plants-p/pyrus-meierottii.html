<p>Pyrus meierottii, commonly known as the Meierott's pear, is a small deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The tree produces small, round pomes that are typically not cultivated for food but are of interest to botanists and horticulturists. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in ecological studies due to its adaptation to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Pyrus meierottii is also used in breeding programs to develop new pear varieties with improved hardiness.</p>
