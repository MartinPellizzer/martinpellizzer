                    <h1>Prunus cerasus f. plena</h1>
<p>Prunus cerasus f. plena, commonly known as the double cherry or double sweet cherry, is a cultivar of the sweet cherry tree characterized by its dense, double flowers.</p>
<p>It originates from the Prunus cerasus species, which is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features showy, clustered blooms that give it a particularly ornamental appearance in spring. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the fruit is typically smaller than standard cherries.</p>
<p>This variety is often grown for its aesthetic value rather than for commercial fruit production.</p>
