<p>Polystachya moniquetiana, commonly known as the Monique's spikegrass, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with elongated, linear leaves. The plant produces inflorescences of small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the genus Polystachya. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
