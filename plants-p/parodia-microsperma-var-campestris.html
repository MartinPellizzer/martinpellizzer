<p>Parodia microsperma var. campestris, commonly known as the Campesina cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in white, radial spines and a dense cluster of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>It requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
