                    <h1>Prasophyllum wallum</h1>
<p>Prasophyllum wallum, commonly known as the Wallum leek orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or heathy soils, often in heathlands or coastal dunes. It is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is crucial for its survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Prasophyllum wallum is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
