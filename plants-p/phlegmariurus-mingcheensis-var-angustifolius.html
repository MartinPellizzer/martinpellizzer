<p>Phlegmariurus mingcheensis var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock tamarisk, is a rare moss species belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, dark green shoots and narrow, linear leaves that are often curled or twisted. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates in arid or semi-arid environments, showing a high degree of desiccation tolerance. Its spore-producing capsules are usually borne on short, erect stems, and the leaves have a distinctive papillose structure.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features.</p>
