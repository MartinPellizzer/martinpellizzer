                    <h1>Pteris buckleyi</h1>
<p>Pteris buckleyi, commonly known as Buckley's water fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically 20â€“40 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in wet soil.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
