<p>Poa macrocalyx var. chishimana, commonly known as the Chishimana bluegrass, is a variant of the bluegrass genus native to high-altitude regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats on rocky or open slopes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
