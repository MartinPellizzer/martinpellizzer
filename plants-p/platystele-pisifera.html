                    <h1>Platystele pisifera</h1>
<p>Platystele pisifera, commonly known as the leafy ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the orchid family.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid that grows in shaded, humid environments, typically in the understory of tropical forests. The plant is characterized by its simple, grass-like leaves and a single, delicate flower with white petals and a greenish-yellow labellum. It is found primarily in the Andes, spanning countries such as Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
