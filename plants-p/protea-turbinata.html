<p>Protea turbinata, commonly known as the Turban Protea, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Proteaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that resemble a turban, composed of numerous white to pinkish flowers. The plant is native to the Western and Eastern Cape provinces, where it thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Its flowers are typically visited by birds, particularly the sugarbird, which plays a key role in its pollination.</p>
