                    <h1>Paepalanthus tricholepis</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus tricholepis, commonly known as the Andean snowberry, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat.</p>
<p>Paepalanthus tricholepis is adapted to survive in harsh mountain environments, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils.</p>
