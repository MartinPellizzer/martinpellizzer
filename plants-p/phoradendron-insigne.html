<p>Phoradendron insigne, commonly known as the showy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually clustered at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are followed by fleshy, red berries. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which eat the berries and later excrete the seeds onto other host trees.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food for birds and insects.</p>
