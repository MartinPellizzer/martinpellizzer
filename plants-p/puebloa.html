                    <h1>Puebloa</h1>
<p>Puebloa, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and fuzzy, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Puebloa is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a valuable addition to desert gardens.</p>
