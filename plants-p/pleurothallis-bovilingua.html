                    <h1>Pleurothallis bovilingua</h1>
<p>Pleurothallis bovilingua, commonly known as the "tongue of the cow" orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually elongated and grass-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air.</p>
<p>This orchid is often epiphytic, growing on trees rather than in soil, which is a common trait among many orchid species.</p>
