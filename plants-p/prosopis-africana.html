<p>Prosopis africana, commonly known as the African mesquite, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to spines in mature plants, and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by legume pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to drought, with deep root systems that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Prosopis africana is also valued for its timber and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
