                    <h1>Parabaena scytophylla</h1>
<p>Parabaena scytophylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like structures that resemble foliage, and its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its specialized roots for nutrient absorption from the air and surrounding environment. It thrives in humid, shaded conditions and is often found growing on the trunks of trees in dense tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Parabaena scytophylla is considered vulnerable and is protected in many regions.</p>
