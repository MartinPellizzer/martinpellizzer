                    <h1>Poa granitica</h1>
<p>Poa granitica, commonly known as the granitic grass, is a perennial species native to high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, Poa granitica is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
