                    <h1>Pitcairnia barrigae</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia barrigae, commonly known as the "Barriga" or "Belly Plant," is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a feature typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with colorful bracts that can range from red to orange, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are often lined with tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes, which help in water absorption and gas exchange.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia barrigae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
