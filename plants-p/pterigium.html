                    <h1>Pterigium</h1>
<p>Pterigium, commonly known as a "wing spot" or "grower's eye," is a benign, non-cancerous growth that develops on the conjunctiva of the eye.</p>
<p>It typically appears as a fleshy, triangular-shaped lesion near the inner corner of the eye, often extending onto the cornea. Botanically, it is not a plant but a medical condition; however, the term "pterigium" originates from the Greek word "pterygion," meaning wing, due to its resemblance to a wing. It is often associated with environmental factors such as exposure to UV radiation and dry air.</p>
<p>While not a plant, the term is sometimes confused with botanical terms due to its name.</p>
