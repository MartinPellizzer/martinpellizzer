                    <h1>Platanthera × lueri</h1>
<p>Platanthera × lueri, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a rare and fascinating plant that results from the cross between Platanthera chlorophaea and Platanthera falcata.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and fens. The plant produces tall, slender stems with showy, greenish-white flowers that are often fragrant. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Platanthera × lueri is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
