                    <h1>Perityle pennellii</h1>
<p>Perityle pennellii, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to access deep groundwater, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Perityle pennellii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in desert ecosystems.</p>
