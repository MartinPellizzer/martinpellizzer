                    <h1>Polypleurum phuwuaense</h1>
<p>Polypleurum phuwuaense, commonly known as the Phu Wiwa fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of northern Thailand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green with a subtle, waxy texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it forms dense clusters on rocky or humus-rich soils.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
