                    <h1>Peyritschia pinetorum</h1>
<p>Peyritschia pinetorum, commonly known as the pine tree lichen, is a symbiotic lichen that forms a mutualistic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the bark of coniferous trees, particularly pines, in temperate and boreal forest ecosystems. The thallus is usually crust-like, forming a thin, adherent layer on the host surface. It plays a role in nutrient cycling and can serve as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
<p>Peyritschia pinetorum is often found in shaded, moist environments where it can thrive without direct sunlight.</p>
