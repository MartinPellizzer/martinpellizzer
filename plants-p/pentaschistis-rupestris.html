<p>Pentaschistis rupestris, commonly known as the rock pentaschistis, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, clustered growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and requires well-drained conditions to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
