<p>Papaver dubium proles modestum, commonly known as the modest scarlet poppy, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the poppy family.</p>

The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silky hair, while its stem is slender and often branched.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
