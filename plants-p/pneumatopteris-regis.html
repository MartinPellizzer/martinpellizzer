                    <h1>Pneumatopteris regis</h1>
<p>Pneumatopteris regis, commonly known as the royal water fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its leaves, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Pneumatopteris regis is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
