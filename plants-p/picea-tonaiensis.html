                    <h1>Picea tonaiensis</h1>
<p>Picea tonaiensis, commonly known as the Tonai spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in subalpine and alpine zones.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Picea tonaiensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
