                    <h1>Poa canina</h1>
<p>Poa canina, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows. The plant has fine, needle-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily and establish itself in various habitats.</p>
<p>Poa canina is also valued for its use in turfgrass and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
