<p>Physalis obscura var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy gooseberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, pubescent stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries enclosed in a papery calyx that turns orange-red as the fruit matures. The berries are typically edible, though they are not as widely cultivated as other physalis species.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or garden settings.</p>
