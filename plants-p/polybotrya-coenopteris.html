                    <h1>Polybotrya coenopteris</h1>
<p>Polybotrya coenopteris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a lacy appearance.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sorus, which are protected by a specialized structure called a indusium.</p>
