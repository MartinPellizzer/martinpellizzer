                    <h1>Picea pinsapo var. argentea</h1>
<p>Picea pinsapo var. argentea, commonly known as the silver firs of the Canary Islands, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the volcanic soils of Tenerife.</p>
<p>This variant of the Canary Island pine is distinguished by its silvery-white undersides on its needle-like leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in the humid, subtropical climate of the island's high-altitude regions. The plant is adapted to withstand strong winds and nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable component of the island's unique flora.</p>
