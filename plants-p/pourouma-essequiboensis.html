                    <h1>Pourouma essequiboensis</h1>
<p>Pourouma essequiboensis, commonly known as the Essequibo palm, is a species of palm native to the Guianas and northern South America.</p>
<p>It is a tall, slender tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, characterized by its long, pinnate leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into elongated, fibrous fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>The Essequibo palm is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited commercial use due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements.</p>
