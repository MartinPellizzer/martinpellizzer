                    <h1>Puccinellia sclerodes</h1>
<p>Puccinellia sclerodes, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions due to its deep root system. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray appearance that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Puccinellia sclerodes plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
