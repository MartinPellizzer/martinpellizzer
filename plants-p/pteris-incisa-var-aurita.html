<p>Pteris incisa var. aurita, commonly known as the golden hairsedge, is a fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in golden to yellowish hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the ground.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, typical of fern reproductive structures.</p>
