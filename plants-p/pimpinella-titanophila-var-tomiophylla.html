                    <h1>Pimpinella titanophila var. tomiophylla</h1>
<p>Pimpinella titanophila var. tomiophylla, commonly known as the giant cow parsley, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, umbrella-like inflorescence composed of small white to pale yellow flowers. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Native to specific regions in southern Africa, it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
