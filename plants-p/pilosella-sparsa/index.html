                            <h1>Pilosella Sparsa</h1>
<p>Goatweed, scientifically known as Pilosella sparsa, is a hardy perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, hairy stems, and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, it thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Despite its modest appearance, goatweed plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance. Its resilience and adaptability make it a common yet overlooked component of many natural habitats.</p>
