                    <h1>Platythyra relaxata</h1>
<p>Platythyra relaxata, commonly known as the soft rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, sprawling form with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers during the warmer months, adding a decorative touch to its appearance. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Platythyra relaxata is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique aesthetic.</p>
