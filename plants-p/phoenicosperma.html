                    <h1>Phoenicosperma</h1>
<p>Phoenicosperma, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red pneumatophores, which are specialized roots that aid in gas exchange in waterlogged soil. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its fruits are small, woody capsules containing a single seed. Phoenicosperma plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an essential component of mangrove ecosystems.</p>
