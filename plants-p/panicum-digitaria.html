                    <h1>Panicum digitaria</h1>
<p>Panicum digitaria, commonly known as green panic, is a warm-season grass native to Africa and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a common weed in agricultural fields and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is both a useful forage crop and a challenging weed to manage.</p>
