                    <h1>Phyllodes adenocarpa</h1>
<p>Phyllodes adenocarpa, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like structures called phyllodes, which are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. These phyllodes are adapted for water conservation, a feature essential for survival in the arid environments where the plant typically grows. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in compact spikes, which bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
