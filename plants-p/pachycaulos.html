<p>Pachycaulos, commonly known as the thick-stemmed plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, fleshy stems that store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. The leaves are typically narrow and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. These plants produce small, daisy-like flowers that are usually yellow or white in color.</p>
<p>Pachycaulos species are often found in rocky or sandy soils in regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
