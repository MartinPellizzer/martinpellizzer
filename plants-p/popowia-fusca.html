                    <h1>Popowia fusca</h1>
<p>Popowia fusca, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its density and color. The plant typically grows in humid, lowland areas and has simple, opposite leaves with a leathery texture. Its flowers are small and clustered, often white or pink, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Popowia fusca is now classified as endangered in many of its native habitats.</p>
