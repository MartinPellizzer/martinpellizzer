                    <h1>Picea orientalis var. longifolia</h1>
<p>Picea orientalis var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaf fir, is a variant of the oriental fir native to the eastern Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and long, slender needles that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that hang downward, a feature that distinguishes it from other fir species. Its foliage is dense and provides good wind resistance, making it suitable for windbreaks.</p>
<p>The longifolia variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings.</p>
