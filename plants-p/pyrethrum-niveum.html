                    <h1>Pyrethrum niveum</h1>
<p>Pyrethrum niveum, commonly known as the white pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family and is known for its finely divided, fern-like leaves. Pyrethrum niveum is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for its insecticidal properties, which are more commonly associated with other pyrethrum species.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
