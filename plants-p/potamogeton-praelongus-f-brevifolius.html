                    <h1>Potamogeton praelongus f. brevifolius</h1>
<p>Potamogeton praelongus f. brevifolius, commonly known as the short-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are shorter than those of the typical species, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Potamogeton genus. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and fish.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality in its native habitats.</p>
