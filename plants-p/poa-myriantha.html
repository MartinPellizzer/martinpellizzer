                    <h1>Poa myriantha</h1>
<p>Poa myriantha, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form compact clumps. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, two-lobed florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Poa myriantha is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
