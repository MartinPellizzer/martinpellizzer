                    <h1>Padus cartilaginea</h1>
<p>Padus cartilaginea, commonly known as the cartilage maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, red-orange flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with cool, moist climates.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects.</p>
