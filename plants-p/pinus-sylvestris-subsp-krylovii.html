<p>Pinus sylvestris subsp.</p>
<p>krylovii, commonly known as the Siberian pine, is a subspecies of the Scots pine native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Siberia. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid than those of the typical Scots pine.</p>
<p>The cones of this subspecies are often larger and more robust, with thick, scaly scales that protect the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil quality.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its resilience and is often used in reforestation efforts in its native range.</p>
