<p>Pachyrhizanthe macrorhizos, commonly known as the giant root orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fleshy rhizomes that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in tropical and subtropical environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with intricate patterns, often in shades of yellow and green. Its botanical features include long, narrow leaves and a complex root system adapted for survival in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in its native range.</p>
