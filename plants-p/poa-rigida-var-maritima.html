<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, dense foliage and ability to thrive in salty, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to harsh maritime environments, making it an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
