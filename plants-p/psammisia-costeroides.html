<p>Psammisia costeroides, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, linear leaves adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Psammisia costeroides plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range.</p>
