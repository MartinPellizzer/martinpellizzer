<p>Parkinsonia torreyana, commonly known as the Torrey acacia, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are often mistaken for ferns due to their delicate, lacy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by elongated seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental plant in xeriscaping and native landscaping.</p>
