<p>Phoradendron juruanum, commonly known as the Jurua mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying on its host tree for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its parasitic nature allows it to grow on a variety of host trees, including those in the families Moraceae and Fabaceae.</p>
<p>The species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of the forest canopy.</p>
