                    <h1>Potameia lucida</h1>
<p>Potameia lucida, commonly known as the shining tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Potameia lucida plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
