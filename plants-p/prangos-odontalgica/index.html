                            <h1>Prangos Odontalgica</h1>
<p>Prangos odontalgica is a striking member of the Apiaceae family known for its distinctive appearance and ecological significance. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in harsh, high-altitude environments. Its name, derived from the Greek words for "tooth" and "pain," hints at its historical use in traditional medicine. The plant features bright yellow flowers and a robust, branching structure that makes it easily recognizable. Despite its beauty, Prangos odontalgica remains a relatively obscure species, often overlooked in mainstream botanical discussions.</p>
