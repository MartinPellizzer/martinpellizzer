<p>Polygala arillata var. revoluta, commonly known as the curled-leaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is distinguished by its unique, rolled or curled leaf margins, which give it its common name.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands or along riverbanks.</p>
