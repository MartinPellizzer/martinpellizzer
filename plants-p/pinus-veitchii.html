                    <h1>Pinus veitchii</h1>
<p>Pinus veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer with slender, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are elongated and often remain attached to the branches for several years. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pinus veitchii is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
