<p>Prasium hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy prasium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soil, preferring cooler and more humid conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely cultivated and remains relatively obscure in horticultural circles.</p>
