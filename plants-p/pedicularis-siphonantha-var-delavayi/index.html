                            <h1>Pedicularis Siphonantha Var. Delavayi</h1>
<p>Pedicularis siphonantha var. delavayi is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the high mountains of southwest China. Known for its vivid red and yellow flowers, it thrives in cold, rocky environments at high altitudes. This variant of the genus Pedicularis is often referred to as the "lady's slipper" due to the shape of its blooms. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic flowering plants. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, this plant is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
