                    <h1>Pseudosophora</h1>
<p>Pseudosophora, commonly known as the false sophora, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to Asia, particularly China. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Pseudosophora species are often found in forested areas and are adapted to a variety of soil types.</p>
<p>They play a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through their symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
