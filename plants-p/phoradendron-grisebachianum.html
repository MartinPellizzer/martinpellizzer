<p>Phoradendron grisebachianum, commonly known as the grayleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually gray-green in color, and it produces white or yellowish flowers followed by small, fleshy berries. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it photosynthesizes for additional energy.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure includes a woody stem and a complex system of haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system.</p>
