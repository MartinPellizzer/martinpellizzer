<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, spurred flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant features a pseudobulb with a single leaf and produces a raceme of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, or red. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and often endangered species in its native range.</p>
