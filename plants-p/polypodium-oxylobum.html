                    <h1>Polypodium oxylobum</h1>
<p>Polypodium oxylobum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky slopes and forest floors. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into feather-like structures. Its leaves are biennial, with the first year producing only a sterile frond and the second year producing both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fertile fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
