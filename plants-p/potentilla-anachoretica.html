                    <h1>Potentilla anachoretica</h1>
<p>Potentilla anachoretica, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant typically thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited moisture. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Potentilla anachoretica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
