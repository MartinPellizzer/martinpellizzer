                    <h1>Phaseolus dinteri</h1>
<p>Phaseolus dinteri, commonly known as the Dinter's bean, is a rare and endangered legume native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pod-like fruits that contain a single, elongated seed. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Phaseolus dinteri is considered critically endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
