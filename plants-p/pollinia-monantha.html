                    <h1>Pollinia monantha</h1>
<p>Pollinia monantha, commonly known as the orchid with clustered pollinia, is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique reproductive structure, where the pollen is aggregated into compact units called pollinia. These pollinia are typically attached to a viscid disc, which aids in their transfer during pollination. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that attract various pollinators, primarily bees and wasps.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject in the study of orchid pollination mechanisms.</p>
