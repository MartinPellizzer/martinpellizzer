<p>Parathesis calimensis, commonly known as the Calimense Parathesis, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pendant-like flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of pink and white. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface, adapted to thrive in high humidity and partial shade. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in the rich, moist soil of its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
