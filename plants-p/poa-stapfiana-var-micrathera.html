                    <h1>Poa stapfiana var. micrathera</h1>
<p>Poa stapfiana var. micrathera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine zones.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying high-altitude flora.</p>
