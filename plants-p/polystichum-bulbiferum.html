                    <h1>Polystichum bulbiferum</h1>
<p>Polystichum bulbiferum, commonly known as the bulbous shield fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in distinct groups. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>The unique feature of this fern is its ability to produce bulb-like structures, which can give rise to new plants.</p>
