<p>Phegopteris effusa, commonly known as the broad buckwheat fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that are often divided into smaller, lobed segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The fern's robust and adaptive nature makes it a common sight in various forest habitats.</p>
