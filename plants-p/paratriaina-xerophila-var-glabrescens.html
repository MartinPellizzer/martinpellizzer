<p>Paratriaina xerophila var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leaved xerophyte, is a succulent plant native to arid regions.</p>
<p>It possesses thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant's leaves are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, reducing water loss through transpiration. It produces small, clustered flowers that are often pale yellow or greenish in color.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
