                    <h1>Pinguicula nana</h1>
<p>Pinguicula nana, commonly known as the dwarf butterwort, is a small carnivorous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant produces tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, often growing on rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in cold, harsh climates where traditional nutrients are scarce.</p>
