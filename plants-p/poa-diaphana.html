<p>Poa diaphana, commonly known as the ghost grass, is a species of grass native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pale green blades that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in loose panicles.</p>
<p>Poa diaphana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
