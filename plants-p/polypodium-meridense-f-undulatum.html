<p>Polypodium meridense f. undulatum, commonly known as the undulating rock fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that exhibit a distinctive undulating pattern along their margins. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
