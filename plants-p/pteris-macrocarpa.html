                    <h1>Pteris macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Pteris macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruit water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are covered in a thick, waxy cuticle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests.</p>
<p>Pteris macrocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
