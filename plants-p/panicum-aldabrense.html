                    <h1>Panicum aldabrense</h1>
<p>Panicum aldabrense, commonly known as Aldabra grass, is a flowering plant native to the Aldabra Atoll in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that thrives in arid and coastal environments, characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize sandy and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Panicum aldabrense plays a minor ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
