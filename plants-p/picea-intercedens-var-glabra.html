<p>Picea intercedens var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark, which distinguishes it from other spruce species. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green and slightly curved. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in cooler, moist environments and is often found in boreal and subalpine regions.</p>
