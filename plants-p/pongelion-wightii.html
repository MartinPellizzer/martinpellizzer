                    <h1>Pongelion wightii</h1>
<p>Pongelion wightii, commonly known as the Wight's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in dense forests or along stream banks. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to attach to tree trunks or branches without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Pongelion wightii is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
