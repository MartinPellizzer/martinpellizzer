                    <h1>Parantennaria</h1>
<p>Parantennaria, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often appear in clusters, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plants typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Parantennaria species are often found in regions of southern Africa, where they have adapted to harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Their botanical features make them an interesting subject for study in plant adaptation and ecology.</p>
