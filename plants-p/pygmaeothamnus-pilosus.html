                    <h1>Pygmaeothamnus pilosus</h1>
<p>Pygmaeothamnus pilosus, commonly known as the silky pygmy grevillea, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, needle-like leaves covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.</p>
