                            <h1>Pterostylis Virens</h1>
<p>Pterostylis virens is a rare and fascinating orchid native to eastern Australia. Known for its unique and striking appearance, this plant features a slender green stem and a single, elongated leaf. Its most notable characteristic is its distinctive greenish-yellow flower, which resembles a small insect. This orchid thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, Pterostylis virens is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
