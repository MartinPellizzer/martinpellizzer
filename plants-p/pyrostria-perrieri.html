                    <h1>Pyrostria perrieri</h1>
<p>Pyrostria perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically green when immature and turn brown as they mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
