<p>Pinalia baeuerleniana, commonly known as the Baeuerlen's pincushion, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiky inflorescences that resemble a pincushion, giving it its common name. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Pinalia baeuerleniana is considered endangered and requires protection.</p>
