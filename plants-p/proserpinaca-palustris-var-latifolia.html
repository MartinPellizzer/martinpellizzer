                    <h1>Proserpinaca palustris var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Proserpinaca palustris var. latifolia, commonly known as marsh pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshes in North America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically 2â€“5 cm in diameter, with a broad, flat structure adapted for floating or submerged growth. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that emerge on slender stems above the water surface. It thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often found in association with other aquatic vegetation.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it both a valuable habitat-forming species and a potential invasive in non-native environments.</p>
