<p>Portulaca elatinoides, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its stems are covered in a waxy coating, which reduces water loss and protects against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Portulaca elatinoides is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and salt exposure.</p>
