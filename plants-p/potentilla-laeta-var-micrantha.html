                    <h1>Potentilla laeta var. micrantha</h1>
<p>Potentilla laeta var. micrantha, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with similar conditions.</p>
