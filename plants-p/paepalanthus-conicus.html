<p>Paepalanthus conicus, commonly known as the spiny pincushion cactus, is a species native to the dry regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of spines that protect it from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. Its structure is adapted to store water efficiently, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities in desert gardens.</p>
