<p>Paspalum plicatulum subsp.</p>
<p>montevidense, commonly known as the Montevidense grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Uruguay and southern Brazil. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and seasonally flooded areas, and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in wetland ecosystems and a potential candidate for restoration projects in disturbed habitats.</p>
