<p>Passovia magdalenae, commonly known as the Magdalena's bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-violet petals and tubular shape, which are adapted for pollination by specific species of hummingbirds. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Passovia magdalenae is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
