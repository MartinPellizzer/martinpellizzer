                    <h1>Picea excelsa f. scalena</h1>
<p>Picea excelsa f. scalena, commonly known as the scalene white spruce, is a botanical variant of the white spruce species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and elongated, needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This form is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. The cones are small and woody, containing two to three seeds, and the tree is valued for its timber and ecological role in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its genetic distinctiveness makes it an important subject for botanical and genetic studies.</p>
