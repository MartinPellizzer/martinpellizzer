<p>Polypleurum stylosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with slender, branching roots that help anchor it in muddy or sandy substrates. Its fronds are typically divided into small, serrated segments, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation for aquatic life.</p>
