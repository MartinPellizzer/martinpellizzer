                    <h1>Pawia pallida</h1>
<p>Pawia pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its pale, almost translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its unique morphology and limited habitat make it highly susceptible to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this delicate and captivating species.</p>
