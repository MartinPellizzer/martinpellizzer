<p>Polypodium pyriforme, commonly known as the saddleback fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that form a heart-shaped or saddle-like appearance. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to anchor itself to trees and absorb moisture from the air. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain water in humid environments.</p>
<p>Polypodium pyriforme is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to shaded, moist conditions.</p>
