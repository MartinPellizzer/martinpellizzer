                    <h1>Platantheroides</h1>
<p>Platantheroides, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a genus of orchids native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their slender, erect stems and showy, often fragrant flowers that resemble lanterns. The flowers typically bloom in late summer, producing a striking display of yellow or orange hues. Platantheroides species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they rely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>They are often found in shaded, moist woodlands and are considered indicators of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
