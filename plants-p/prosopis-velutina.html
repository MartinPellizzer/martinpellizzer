<p>Prosopis velutina, commonly known as the velvet mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by legume pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>The velvet mesquite is also valued for its role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
