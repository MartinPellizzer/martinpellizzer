<p>Paronychia serpyllifolia var. herniarioides, commonly known as hairy mouse-ear or hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as gravelly slopes and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth and ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its hardy and drought-tolerant nature.</p>
