                            <h1>Pilosella Hoppeana Subsp. Macrantha</h1>
<p>Goatweed, scientifically known as Pilosella hoppeana subsp. macrantha, is a hardy perennial plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fuzzy, silver-green foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. This resilient plant thrives in rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. Despite its modest appearance, goatweed plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native environment. Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects.</p>
