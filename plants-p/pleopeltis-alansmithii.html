                    <h1>Pleopeltis alansmithii</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis alansmithii, commonly known as the Alansmith's rock fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit, often found on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant features intricate, lanceolate fronds with a dense arrangement of small, serrated pinnae. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
