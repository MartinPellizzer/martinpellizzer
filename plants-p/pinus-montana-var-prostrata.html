                    <h1>Pinus montana var. prostrata</h1>
<p>Pinus montana var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate mountain pine, is a low-growing variant of the mountain pine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, forming dense mats of foliage that cover the ground. The needles are typically shorter and more clustered compared to other pine species, and the cones are small and often retained on the branches for years. This variety is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Its unique form makes it an important component of certain mountain ecosystems.</p>
