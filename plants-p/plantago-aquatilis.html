                    <h1>Plantago aquatilis</h1>
<p>Plantago aquatilis, commonly known as water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are pollinated by wind. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively.</p>
<p>Plantago aquatilis plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
