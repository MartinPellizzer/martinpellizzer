<p>Pleurothallis hirtipes, commonly known as the hairy pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly found in the cloud forests of Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree branches or rocks. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which are typically clustered in small inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, short hairs, giving it the "hairy" descriptor in its common name.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
