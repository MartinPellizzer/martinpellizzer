<p>Pseudosophora sericea, commonly known as silverleaf false sophora, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring, followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Pseudosophora sericea is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
