<p>Papaver somniferum var. coccineum, commonly known as the red poppy, is a variant of the opium poppy characterized by its striking red flowers.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces strikingly beautiful blooms with bright red petals and a dark red center, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. While it is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes, it is also historically significant for its latex, which can be processed into opium.</p>
<p>Due to its botanical relation to other varieties, it is subject to strict regulations in many countries.</p>
