                    <h1>Prasophyllum limnetes</h1>
<p>Prasophyllum limnetes, commonly known as the water leek, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and a single, slender flower spike that typically blooms in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or waterlogged habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Prasophyllum limnetes is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
