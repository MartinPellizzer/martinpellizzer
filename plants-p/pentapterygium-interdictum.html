<p>Pentapterygium interdictum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and intriguing species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name.

It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Pentapterygium interdictum is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
