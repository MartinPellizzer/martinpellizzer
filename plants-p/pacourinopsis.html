                    <h1>Pacourinopsis</h1>
<p>Pacourinopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and striking, showy flowers that often resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and accumulated debris. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns that enhance its mysterious appearance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pacourinopsis is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
