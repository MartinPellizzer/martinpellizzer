                    <h1>Puccinellia palustris</h1>
<p>Puccinellia palustris, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to wetlands and saline soils across North America.</p>
<p>It has fine, hair-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is adapted to tolerate high salinity and waterlogged conditions, making it an important component of coastal and marsh ecosystems. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in these environments.</p>
<p>Puccinellia palustris plays a vital role in supporting biodiversity by providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species.</p>
