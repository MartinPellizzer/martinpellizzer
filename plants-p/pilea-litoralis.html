<p>Pilea litoralis, commonly known as the water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or wetlands, with its floating leaves forming a dense mat on the water surface. The plant has small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its roots help stabilize the sediment, contributing to water clarity.</p>
<p>Pilea litoralis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits.</p>
