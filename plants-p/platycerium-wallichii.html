                    <h1>Platycerium wallichii</h1>
<p>Platycerium wallichii, commonly known as the cliff fern or wall fern, is a unique epiphytic plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, antler-like fronds that grow directly from the base of the plant, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this fern thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a rough texture that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Platycerium wallichii is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
