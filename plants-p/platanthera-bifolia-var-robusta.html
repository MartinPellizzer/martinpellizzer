                    <h1>Platanthera bifolia var. robusta</h1>
<p>Platanthera bifolia var. robusta, commonly known as the robust lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to moist, shaded forest floors in North America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, grass-like leaves and produces striking, fragrant, white to pale pink flower spikes in late summer. The flowers are arranged in a dense, three-rowed pattern, typical of the orchid family. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its symbiotic relationship with soil microorganisms.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its robust growth and larger, more showy flowers compared to the typical form.</p>
