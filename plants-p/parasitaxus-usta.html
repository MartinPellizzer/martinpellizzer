                    <h1>Parasitaxus usta</h1>
<p>Parasitaxus usta, commonly known as the Indian yew, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant has a distinctive appearance with scale-like leaves and small, red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It is considered a living fossil due to its primitive features and limited distribution.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological significance, it is threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting.</p>
