                    <h1>Pycreus micans</h1>
<p>Pycreus micans, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat sensitivity, Pycreus micans is often considered a conservation concern.</p>
