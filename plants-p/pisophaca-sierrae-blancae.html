                    <h1>Pisophaca sierrae-blancae</h1>
<p>Pisophaca sierrae-blancae, commonly known as the Sierra Whitebark, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude regions of the Sierra Nevada mountains.</p>
<p>It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its dense, white-woolly foliage that provides insulation against the harsh mountain climate. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind, a common adaptation in alpine environments. Its seeds are dispersed by birds and small mammals, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
