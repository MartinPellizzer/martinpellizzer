<p>Poecilopteris fraxinifolia, commonly known as the ash-leaf fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds with a fraxinus-like leaf shape.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to regions in southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with a creeping rhizome and can form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant thrives in humid, well-drained soils.</p>
