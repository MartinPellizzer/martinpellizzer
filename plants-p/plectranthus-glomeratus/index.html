<p>Cluster plectranthus, scientifically known as Plectranthus glomeratus, is a strikingly unique plant native to South Africa. With its dense clusters of aromatic leaves, it stands out for its lush green foliage and compact growth habit. Often mistaken for a succulent due to its fleshy leaves, it thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade. This versatile plant is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and ease of care. Its ability to adapt to various climates makes it a favored choice for both indoor and outdoor settings.</p>
