<p>Phoradendron gracilispicum, commonly known as the slender-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the tropics.</p>
<p>It possesses small, leathery leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered together. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it photosynthesizes to obtain additional energy. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
