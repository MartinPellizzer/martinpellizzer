<p>Primula parryi f. mucronata, commonly known as the Sierra Madre primrose, is a hybrid form of the primula genus native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow to white in color. The leaves are usually basal, ovate to elliptic, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. This variety thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the unique floral diversity of its native environment.</p>
