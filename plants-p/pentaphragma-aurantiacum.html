                    <h1>Pentaphragma aurantiacum</h1>
<p>Pentaphragma aurantiacum, commonly known as the golden bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on its bladders for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The bright yellow color of its bladders gives the plant its common name and makes it visually distinctive.</p>
