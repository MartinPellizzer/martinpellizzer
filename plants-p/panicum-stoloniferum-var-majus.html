                    <h1>Panicum stoloniferum var. majus</h1>
<p>Panicum stoloniferum var. majus, commonly known as the giant panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, feathery plumes that can reach heights of up to 6 feet. The plant has a rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth habit, allowing it to spread aggressively through both underground runners and above-ground stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces showy, fluffy seed heads in late summer.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
