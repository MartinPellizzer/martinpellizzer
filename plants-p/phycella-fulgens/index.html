                            <h1>Phycella Fulgens</h1>
<p>Golden star, scientifically known as Phycella fulgens, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of South America. Its name is derived from the bright yellow flowers that resemble small stars scattered across its foliage. This hardy species thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy terrains. With its unique appearance and resilience, it has become a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens. The Golden star not only adds visual interest to landscapes but also plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
