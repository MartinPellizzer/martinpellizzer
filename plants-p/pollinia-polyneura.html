                    <h1>Pollinia polyneura</h1>
<p>Pollinia polyneura, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and its distinctive inflorescence that bears clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces specialized pollinia, which are masses of pollen enclosed in a sticky matrix, a feature common in many orchid species. These pollinia are adapted for transfer by insects, particularly bees, which are attracted to the plant's sweet nectar.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Pollinia polyneura is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
