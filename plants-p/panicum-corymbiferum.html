                    <h1>Panicum corymbiferum</h1>
<p>Panicum corymbiferum, commonly known as the purpletop millet, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and its striking purple-tinted inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spikelet-like flowers that are often tinged with purple or red hues. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy ornamental and forage grass.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, and it is often used in restoration projects and as a landscape plant.</p>
