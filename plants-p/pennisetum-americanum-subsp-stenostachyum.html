<p>Pennisetum americanum subsp.</p>
<p>stenostachyum, commonly known as narrow-stemmed fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, with narrow, grass-like leaves that have a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The plant produces dense clusters of small, pale green to golden yellow flower spikes during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its architectural form and the striking contrast between its foliage and floral display.</p>
