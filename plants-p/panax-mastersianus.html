                    <h1>Panax mastersianus</h1>
<p>Panax mastersianus, commonly known as the Master's ginseng, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Araliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of China and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered growth habit and dark green, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by red berries, which are typically consumed by local wildlife. Its roots, similar to other ginseng species, are believed to have medicinal properties, though research on its active compounds is limited.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Panax mastersianus is considered an endangered species.</p>
