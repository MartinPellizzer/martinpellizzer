                    <h1>Peucedanum album</h1>
<p>Peucedanum album, commonly known as fool's parsley, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small white or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 50â€“100 cm and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its seeds are small, ovoid, and often covered in fine hairs, while its root system is fibrous and relatively shallow.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered invasive in some regions and can be mistaken for edible parsley, leading to potential poisoning if consumed.</p>
