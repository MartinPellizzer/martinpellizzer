<p>Poa astonii var. oraria, commonly known as the coastal bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This variety thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt-laden air and coastal winds. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ability to stabilize coastal dunes, it plays an important ecological role in protecting shorelines from erosion.</p>
