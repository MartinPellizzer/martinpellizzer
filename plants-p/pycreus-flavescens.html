                    <h1>Pycreus flavescens</h1>
<p>Pycreus flavescens, commonly known as the yellow marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in soft, waterlogged substrates.</p>
<p>Pycreus flavescens plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
