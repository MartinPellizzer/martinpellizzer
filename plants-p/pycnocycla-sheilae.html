                    <h1>Pycnocycla sheilae</h1>
<p>Pycnocycla sheilae, commonly known as the Sheil's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones instead of flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and specific habitat requirements make it highly vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure the survival of this unique botanical species.</p>
