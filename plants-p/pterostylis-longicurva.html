                    <h1>Pterostylis longicurva</h1>
<p>Pterostylis longicurva, commonly known as the long-lobed helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated greenish-yellow floral structure that resembles a helmet, with a prominent spur. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, primarily thrips, which are attracted to the nectar-rich spur.</p>
<p>The orchid's morphology reflects its adaptation to a specialized ecological niche within its native habitat.</p>
