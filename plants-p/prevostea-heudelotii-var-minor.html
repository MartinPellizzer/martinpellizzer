                    <h1>Prevostea heudelotii var. minor</h1>
<p>Prevostea heudelotii var. minor, commonly known as the lesser prevostea, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, preferring cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range in color from white to pale pink.</p>
<p>This variant is less common than the typical form of Prevostea heudelotii and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its alpine environment.</p>
