                    <h1>Pterocelastrus marginatus</h1>
<p>Pterocelastrus marginatus, commonly known as the African boxthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, elliptical leaves that are usually green on top and paler underneath. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its thorny structure, it is often used as a hedge or for erosion control in its native habitat.</p>
