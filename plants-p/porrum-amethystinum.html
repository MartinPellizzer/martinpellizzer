                    <h1>Porrum amethystinum</h1>
<p>Porrum amethystinum, commonly known as the amethyst bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid purple flowers, which bloom in clusters resembling small bells, and its striking silver-green foliage. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds and certain species of moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Porrum amethystinum is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
