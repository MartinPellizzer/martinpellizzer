<p>Pteridium aquilinum subsp.</p>
<p>lanuginosum, commonly known as the downy bracken, is a fern species characterized by its fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in forest understories and is notable for its ecological resilience.</p>
