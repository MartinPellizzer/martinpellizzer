                    <h1>Potentilla reptans proles lanata</h1>
<p>Potentilla reptans proles lanata, commonly known as the woolly cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control.</p>
<p>The woolly texture of its leaves is due to dense, soft hairs that provide some protection against herbivores and excessive sunlight.</p>
