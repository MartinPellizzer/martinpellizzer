<p>Panicum prostratum var. marquisense, commonly known as the Marquis stiltgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender,匍匐的 stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across moist to wet soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, bristly flowers. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
