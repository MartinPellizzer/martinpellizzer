<p>Phanerosorus sarmentosus, commonly known as the creeping polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, glossy, and often arching fronds that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and often form dense mats, which help in soil stabilization.</p>
<p>The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
