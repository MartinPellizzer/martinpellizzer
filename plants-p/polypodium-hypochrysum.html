<p>Polypodium hypochrysum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden pubescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in pairs.</p>
