                    <h1>Pouteria aylmeri</h1>
<p>Pouteria aylmeri, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that develop into hard, woody fruits. The tree's most notable feature is its edible seeds, commonly referred to as "Brazil nuts," which are enclosed within a three-chambered, spiky fruit. These seeds are rich in nutrients, particularly selenium, and are often harvested for their commercial value.</p>
<p>The tree plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
