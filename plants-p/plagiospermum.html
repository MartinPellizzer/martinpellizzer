<p>Plagiospermum, commonly known as the "false orchid," is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Plagiospermum species are characterized by their sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The flowers are typically small and clustered, often in dense inflorescences, and come in a range of colors including white, yellow, and pink.</p>
<p>Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated as houseplants or in botanical gardens.</p>
