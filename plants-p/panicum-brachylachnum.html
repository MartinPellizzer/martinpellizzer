                    <h1>Panicum brachylachnum</h1>
<p>Panicum brachylachnum, commonly known as the dwarf panicgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground, often in sandy or rocky soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to drought and full sun, making it a hardy plant in arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and resilience, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping or as a ground cover.</p>
