<p>Psychotria arborescens, commonly known as the "angel's trumpets" or "cup of joy," is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters tall, with opposite, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink, purple, or white, blooming throughout the year in warm climates. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Psychotria arborescens is also known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids such as dimethyltryptamine (DMT).</p>
