                    <h1>Poa lanata var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Poa lanata var. vivipara, commonly known as the woolly meadow grass, is a variant of the woolly grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fluffy appearance due to the presence of silky, white hairs on its leaves and stems. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its reproductive strategy includes the production of viviparous shoots, which allow for rapid vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
