                    <h1>Pastinaca sativa var. pratensis</h1>
<p>Pastinaca sativa var. pratensis, commonly known as wild parsnip, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its smooth, hollow stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family, and its roots are often hairy and have a strong, aromatic scent. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Wild parsnip is considered invasive in some regions and can cause skin irritation due to the presence of phototoxic compounds.</p>
