                    <h1>Pelexia repens</h1>
<p>Pelexia repens, commonly known as creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively across moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Pelexia repens is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, where it thrives in humid conditions.</p>
