                    <h1>Pygeum walkeri</h1>
<p>Pygeum walkeri, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its wood is highly valued for its density and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in the furniture and musical instrument industries.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered threatened in its natural range.</p>
