                    <h1>Plectocomia griffithii</h1>
<p>Plectocomia griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's plectocomia, is a rare and striking member of the Araliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like India and Bhutan. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish-white in color, and it produces berries that are red when mature.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
