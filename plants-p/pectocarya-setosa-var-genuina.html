                    <h1>Pectocarya setosa var. genuina</h1>
<p>Pectocarya setosa var. genuina, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive bracted seed heads that resemble dandelion fluff. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
