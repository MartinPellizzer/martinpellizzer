                    <h1>Panicum longiligulatum</h1>
<p>Panicum longiligulatum, commonly known as eastern gamagrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, blade-like leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, bristle-like flowers. This plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Eastern gamagrass is also valued for its use in wildlife habitats and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
