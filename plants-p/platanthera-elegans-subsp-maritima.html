<p>Platanthera elegans subsp.</p>
<p>maritima, commonly known as the coastal lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the Atlantic coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense, spiral arrangement of white to pale pink flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along dunes and tidal flats, thriving in coastal environments. It is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is crucial for its survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
