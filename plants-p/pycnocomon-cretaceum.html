                    <h1>Pycnocomon cretaceum</h1>
<p>Pycnocomon cretaceum, commonly known as the Cretaceous spore, is a fossilized plant structure that provides insight into ancient flora.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spherical spore masses, which are typically found in Cretaceous sedimentary rocks. These spores are often preserved in fine-grained sediments, indicating their aquatic or wetland origin. The morphology of Pycnocomon cretaceum suggests it was produced by early land plants, possibly ferns or mosses.</p>
<p>Its study helps scientists understand the evolution of plant reproductive strategies during the Mesozoic era.</p>
