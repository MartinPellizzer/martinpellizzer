                    <h1>Phalaris glomerata</h1>
<p>Phalaris glomerata, commonly known as marsh grass or slender marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense tussocks near water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize wetland areas effectively.</p>
<p>Phalaris glomerata is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
