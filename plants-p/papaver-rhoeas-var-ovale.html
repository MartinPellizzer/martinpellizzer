                    <h1>Papaver rhoeas var. ovale</h1>
<p>Papaver rhoeas var. ovale, commonly known as the double-flowered poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its thick, layered petals.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and produces vibrant red or orange flowers. It blooms from late spring to early summer and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The double-flowered form results from a genetic mutation that causes the petals to develop in a more complex, clustered arrangement.</p>
