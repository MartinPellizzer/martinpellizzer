<p>Polypodium tetragonum var. leptocladium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20â€“40 cm long. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense clusters, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
