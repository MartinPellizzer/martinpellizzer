                    <h1>Pleurothallis tetroxys</h1>
<p>Pleurothallis tetroxys, commonly known as the four-spurred orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. It features small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale green, with a unique structure that includes four prominent spurred petals. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous, and it produces numerous small, oval-shaped pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and often difficult to cultivate outside its native range.</p>
