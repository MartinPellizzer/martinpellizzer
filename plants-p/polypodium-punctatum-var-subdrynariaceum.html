<p>Polypodium punctatum var. subdrynariaceum, commonly known as the punctate huperzia, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology.</p>
<p>It features elongated, lanceolate fronds with a serrated margin and a dark green coloration. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical structure makes it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study.</p>
