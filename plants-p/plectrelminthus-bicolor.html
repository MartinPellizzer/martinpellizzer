<p>Plectrelminthus bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored lichen, is a unique species that belongs to the family Peltigeraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive bi-colored thallus, typically featuring a dark upper layer and a lighter lower layer. This lichen thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on decaying wood or stone. Its structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to carry out photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality in its habitat.</p>
