                    <h1>Pothos leucophaeus</h1>
<p>Pothos leucophaeus, commonly known as the Variegated Pothos, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically variegated with shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is primarily grown for its attractive foliage rather than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Pothos leucophaeus is a popular indoor plant due to its low maintenance and ability to purify the air.</p>
