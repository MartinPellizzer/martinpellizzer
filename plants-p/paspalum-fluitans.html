<p>Paspalum fluitans, commonly known as floating grass, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and ability to form dense mats on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil, it plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
