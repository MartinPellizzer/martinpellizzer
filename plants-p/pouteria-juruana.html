                    <h1>Pouteria juruana</h1>
<p>Pouteria juruana, commonly known as the "Brazilian nut tree," is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody capsules containing the edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a dense, buttressed root system that helps it thrive in the nutrient-poor soils of the rainforest.</p>
<p>Its fruit is an important food source for various wildlife species, contributing to the ecological balance of the region.</p>
