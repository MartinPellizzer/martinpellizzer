                    <h1>Pedicularis dichotoma var. wardiana</h1>
<p>Pedicularis dichotoma var. wardiana, commonly known as the Ward's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It produces showy, spurred flowers that are usually pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
