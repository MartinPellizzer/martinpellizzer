<p>Picea smithiana, commonly known as the Smith's spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green needles and conical shape, with a moderate growth rate.

It thrives in cold, moist climates and is often found in subalpine and alpine zones.</p>
<p>The wood of Picea smithiana is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making.</p>
