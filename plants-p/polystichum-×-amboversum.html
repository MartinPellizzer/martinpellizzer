                    <h1>Polystichum × amboversum</h1>
<p>Polystichum × amboversum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Polystichum acrostichum and Polystichum polyanthum.</p>
<p>It is a hardy, evergreen fern that thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas. The plant features delicate, bipinnate fronds with a dark green color and a lacy, intricate structure. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its aesthetic qualities.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce spores and is propagated through vegetative means.</p>
