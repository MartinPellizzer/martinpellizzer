                            <h1>Pinus Brutia Subsp. Pityusa</h1>
<p>Brutia pine, scientifically known as Pinus brutia subsp. pityusa, is a unique and resilient conifer native to the eastern Mediterranean region. This subspecies is distinguished by its dense, dark green needles and its ability to thrive in arid and rocky environments. It is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions where it forms dense forests or scattered groves. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional landscaping and forestry. Despite its hardiness, it faces threats from climate change and habitat loss, making conservation efforts increasingly important.</p>
