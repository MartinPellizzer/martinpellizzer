                    <h1>Pinus parva</h1>
<p>Pinus parva, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a small evergreen conifer native to the high elevations of the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of only 1 to 3 meters, with a compact, rounded form that allows it to thrive in harsh alpine environments. The tree has slender, twisted branches and needle-like leaves that are dark green and slightly twisted. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky soils where other plants struggle to grow.</p>
