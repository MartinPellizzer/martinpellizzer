                    <h1>Pinguicula nevadensis</h1>
<p>Pinguicula nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.</p>
<p>It is a small, low-growing plant that forms a rosette of hairy, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects. The leaves are covered in glandular structures that secrete a sticky substance to immobilize prey. It thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its alpine environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
