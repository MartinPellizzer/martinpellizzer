                    <h1>Pteridrys cicuzzai</h1>
<p>Pteridrys cicuzzai, commonly known as the Sicilian maidenhair fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the island of Sicily.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble those of the common maidenhair fern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in rocky crevices or along forest edges. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pteridrys cicuzzai is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
