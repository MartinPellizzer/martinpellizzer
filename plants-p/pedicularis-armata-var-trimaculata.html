                    <h1>Pedicularis armata var. trimaculata</h1>
<p>Pedicularis armata var. trimaculata, commonly known as the three-spotted lousewort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant features erect stems with lance-shaped leaves and produces striking pink to purple flowers with two lips. Its unique floral structure attracts specific pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat requirements, it is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes.</p>
