<p>Pellaea scabra, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stiff, serrated fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
