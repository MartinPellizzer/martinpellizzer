<p>Pentameris procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate pentameris, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It has a sprawling, mat-forming growth habit with thin, wiry stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Pentameris procumbens is adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient species in disturbed or dry soils.</p>
