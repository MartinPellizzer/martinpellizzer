                    <h1>Polygonum orientale</h1>
<p>Polygonum orientale, commonly known as the oriental knotweed, is a perennial herb native to Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple in color, with a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in hue, appearing in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found along stream banks or in wet meadows.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species.</p>
