The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits similar to other prickly pear varieties. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to high altitudes and cold temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is a notable subject in botanical studies of Andean flora.</p>
