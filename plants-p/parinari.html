                    <h1>Parinari</h1>
<p>Parinari, commonly known as the "wild apple" or "mango tree," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Chrysobalanaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, many of which are native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants are typically small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, white or yellowish flowers. The fruit is usually a drupe, often with a sweet, edible pulp, though it may be somewhat tart or astringent.</p>
<p>Parinari species are valued for their ornamental appeal and, in some cases, for their edible fruits and medicinal properties.</p>
