                    <h1>Podocarpus alpinus</h1>
<p>Podocarpus alpinus, commonly known as the alpine podocarp, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, a feature typical of gymnosperms. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and unique morphology make it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
