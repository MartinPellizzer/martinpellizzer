                    <h1>Polybotrya bipinnata</h1>
<p>Polybotrya bipinnata, commonly known as the two-lobed fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that produce clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. Its reproductive structures are borne on the underside of the fronds, forming spore-producing clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Polybotrya bipinnata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
