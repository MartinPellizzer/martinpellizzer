                    <h1>Poa × digena</h1>
<p>Poa × digena, commonly known as the hybrid meadow grass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Poa annua and Poa trivialis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant typically produces a dense carpet of grass-like foliage, which can be difficult to distinguish from its parent species without close examination. It lacks the ability to produce viable seeds, relying instead on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and turfgrass settings.</p>
