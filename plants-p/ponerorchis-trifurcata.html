                    <h1>Ponerorchis trifurcata</h1>
<p>Ponerorchis trifurcata, commonly known as the three-branched orchid, is a rare and unusual orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of three distinct branches, each bearing a single flower. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-yellow, with a subtle fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ponerorchis trifurcata is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
