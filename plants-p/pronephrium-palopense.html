<p>Pronephrium palopense, commonly known as the Malagasy liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leafy shoots and the presence of specialized structures called gemmae, which aid in vegetative reproduction. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern and are covered with a thin, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Pronephrium palopense plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
