                    <h1>Potamogeton strictifolius</h1>
<p>Potamogeton strictifolius, commonly known as rigid-leaf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, which helps it maximize light absorption in water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers.</p>
<p>Due to its dense growth, it can provide important habitat for aquatic invertebrates and fish.</p>
