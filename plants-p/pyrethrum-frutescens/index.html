<p>Pyrethrum, scientifically known as Pyrethrum frutescens, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is renowned for its potent natural insecticidal properties, making it a valuable resource in organic pest control. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are rich in pyrethrins, which are effective against a wide range of insects. Due to its efficacy and environmental safety, Pyrethrum has gained popularity in both agricultural and household applications. Its use dates back centuries, with historical records indicating its application in ancient Egypt and Greece.</p>
