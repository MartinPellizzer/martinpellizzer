The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
