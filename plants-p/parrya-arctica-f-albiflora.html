                    <h1>Parrya arctica f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Parrya arctica f. albiflora, commonly known as the Arctic parrya, is a rare alpine plant native to the Arctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
