                    <h1>Pleurothallis nossax</h1>
<p>Pleurothallis nossax, commonly known as the Andean ghost orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of the Andes.</p>
<p>This epiphytic plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. The plant's unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, it is considered vulnerable in its natural range.</p>
