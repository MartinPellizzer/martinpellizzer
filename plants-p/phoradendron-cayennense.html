                    <h1>Phoradendron cayennense</h1>
<p>Phoradendron cayennense, commonly known as the Cayenne mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Viscaceae family and has a unique structure with a flattened, leaf-like body that is adapted for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red, fleshy berries that contain seeds. Its roots form haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by supporting bird populations that feed on its berries.</p>
