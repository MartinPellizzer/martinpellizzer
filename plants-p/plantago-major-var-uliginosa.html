                    <h1>Plantago major var. uliginosa</h1>
<p>Plantago major var. uliginosa, commonly known as the greater plantain, is a robust perennial herb that thrives in moist, often nitrogen-rich soils.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, erect stalks. It is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other Plantago species and is known for its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and soothing effects.</p>
