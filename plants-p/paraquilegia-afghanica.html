                    <h1>Paraquilegia afghanica</h1>
<p>Paraquilegia afghanica, commonly known as the Afghan broomrape, is a parasitic plant native to Afghanistan and surrounding regions.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a fibrous root system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can pose a challenge to agricultural crops it infests.</p>
