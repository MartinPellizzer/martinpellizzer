<p>Pipturus argenteus var. calcicola, commonly known as the silverleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to limestone-rich environments. Its small, dark berries are an important food source for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>The plant's morphology and growth habits reflect its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, calcareous conditions.</p>
