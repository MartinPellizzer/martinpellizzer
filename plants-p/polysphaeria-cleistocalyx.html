                    <h1>Polysphaeria cleistocalyx</h1>
<p>Polysphaeria cleistocalyx, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the shade of dense foliage. Its unique morphology includes a slender stem and a single, broad leaf that is often covered in a waxy coating.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
