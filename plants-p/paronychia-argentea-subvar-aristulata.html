                    <h1>Paronychia argentea subvar. aristulata</h1>
<p>Paronychia argentea subvar. aristulata, commonly known as silverleaf sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscapes.</p>
