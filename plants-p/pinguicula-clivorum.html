                    <h1>Pinguicula clivorum</h1>
<p>Pinguicula clivorum, commonly known as the cliff bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it retain moisture in its rocky, high-altitude habitat. The plant produces tiny, delicate flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, adapted for pollination by insects. Its trapping mechanism involves sticky glands on the leaf surface that capture small invertebrates, which are then digested to provide nutrients.</p>
<p>Pinguicula clivorum thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on cliffs or in rocky crevices.</p>
