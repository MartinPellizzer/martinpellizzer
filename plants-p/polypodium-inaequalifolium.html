<p>Polypodium inaequalifolium, commonly known as the unequal-leaf polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into varying sizes of pinnae, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices, where it attaches itself to surfaces using rhizomes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Polypodium inaequalifolium is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
