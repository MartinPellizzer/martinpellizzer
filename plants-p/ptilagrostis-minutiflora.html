                    <h1>Ptilagrostis minutiflora</h1>
<p>Ptilagrostis minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
