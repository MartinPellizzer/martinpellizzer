<p>Polypodium swartziana, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique adaptation that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
