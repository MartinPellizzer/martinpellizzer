                <h1>Pedilonum aphanochilum</h1>
<p>Pedilonum aphanochilum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has no leaves and relies entirely on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a lithophyte. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
