<p>Pappophorum elegans, commonly known as the elegant pappus grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves.

It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>
