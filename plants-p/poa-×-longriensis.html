                    <h1>Poa × longriensis</h1>
<p>Poa × longriensis, commonly known as the hybrid meadow grass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Poa annua and Poa nemoralis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy blades that often form dense mats. The plant typically thrives in moist, temperate environments, such as meadows and grasslands. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are usually green to reddish in color.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, Poa × longriensis does not produce viable seeds, relying on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
