                    <h1>Primula pumila var. arctica</h1>
<p>Primula pumila var. arctica, commonly known as the Arctic primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it withstand harsh, cold climates. Its leaves are hairy and rosette-shaped, adapted to minimize heat loss and maximize light absorption.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine plantings due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
