<p>Paspalum humifusum, commonly known as Florida grass or flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes and swampy areas, and is well adapted to waterlogged soils. The plant has a low, spreading growth habit with rhizomes that help it spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains of pollen.</p>
<p>Paspalum humifusum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
