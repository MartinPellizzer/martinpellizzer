<p>Plantago macrorhiza subsp.</p>
<p>purpurascens, commonly known as the purple false plantain, is a perennial herb characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that often display a distinctive purple or reddish tinge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes, which are clustered at the top of the stem. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
