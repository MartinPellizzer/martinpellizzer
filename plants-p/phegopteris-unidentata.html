<p>Phegopteris unidentata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant in the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Phegopteris unidentata plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering pollutants and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
