<p>Pawia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Pawia is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions.</p>
<p>It is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily.</p>
