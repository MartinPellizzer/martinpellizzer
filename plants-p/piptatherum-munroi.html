<p>Piptatherum munroi, commonly known as the dwarf oatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
