                    <h1>Paratheria prostrata</h1>
<p>Paratheria prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate paratheria, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to certain regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions through its extensive root system. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of yellow and white, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Paratheria prostrata is often used in rock gardens and xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
