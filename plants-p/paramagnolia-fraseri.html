                    <h1>Paramagnolia fraseri</h1>
<p>Paramagnolia fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's magnolia, is a rare and ancient flowering plant native to the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Magnoliaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with a slow growth rate and a long lifespan.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Paramagnolia fraseri is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
