<p>Polypodium coraiense, commonly known as the Coari fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients.</p>
