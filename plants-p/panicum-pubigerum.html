                    <h1>Panicum pubigerum</h1>
<p>Panicum pubigerum, commonly known as silver panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous narrow, awned florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Silver panicgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its hardy nature.</p>
