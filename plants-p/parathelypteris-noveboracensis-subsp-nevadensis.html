<p>Parathelypteris noveboracensis subsp.</p>
<p>nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada shield fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture.</p>
<p>The plant prefers moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
