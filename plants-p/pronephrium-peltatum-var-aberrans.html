                    <h1>Pronephrium peltatum var. aberrans</h1>
<p>Pronephrium peltatum var. aberrans, commonly known as the aberrant peltate fern, is a rare and unique variant of the peltate fern family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, peltate fronds that are broadly ovate with a prominent central dimple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
