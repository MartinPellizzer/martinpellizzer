                    <h1>Polygala calcicola</h1>
<p>Polygala calcicola, commonly known as the limestone milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Polygala calcicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range.</p>
