<p>Pseudocyclosorus angustpinnus, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate water fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant features a creeping rhizome with narrow, pinnately divided fronds that are usually less than 30 cm in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in lines along the veins.</p>
<p>This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the understory vegetation in humid habitats.</p>
