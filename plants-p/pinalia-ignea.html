                    <h1>Pinalia ignea</h1>
<p>Pinalia ignea, commonly known as the fiery flame plant, is a flowering species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red and orange inflorescences that resemble flames, hence its common name. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well-suited for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Pinalia ignea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
