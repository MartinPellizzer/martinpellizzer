<p>Pyrus froebelii, commonly known as the Froebel's pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and attractive, finely toothed leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart pomes that ripen in late summer. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is relatively rare in cultivation and requires specific care to thrive.</p>
