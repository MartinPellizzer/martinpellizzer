<p>Potamobryon, commonly known as the water clover, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lamiales.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that often resemble the leaves of clover. They are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Potamobryon species are often used in ecological studies due to their sensitivity to water quality and pollution.</p>
<p>Their presence or absence can serve as an indicator of the health of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
