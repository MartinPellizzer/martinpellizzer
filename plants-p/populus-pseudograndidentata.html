                    <h1>Populus pseudograndidentata</h1>
<p>Populus pseudograndidentata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of other poplar species. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, while the branches are often drooping. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in catkins, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
