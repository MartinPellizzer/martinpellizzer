                    <h1>Pseudopteryxia hendersonii</h1>
<p>Pseudopteryxia hendersonii, commonly known as the Henderson's pteryllia, is a rare and specialized plant native to the high-altitude regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, a common feature among members of its family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pseudopteryxia hendersonii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
