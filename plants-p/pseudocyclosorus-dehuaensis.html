                    <h1>Pseudocyclosorus dehuaensis</h1>
<p>Pseudocyclosorus dehuaensis, commonly known as the Dehua fern, is a rare and specialized member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, typical of ferns. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
