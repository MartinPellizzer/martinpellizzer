                    <h1>Platanthera fornicata var. atropatanica</h1>
<p>Platanthera fornicata var. atropatanica, commonly known as the black marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark violet to almost black flowers, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has a short, erect stem with few leaves, and its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic peat bogs and requires a cool, moist environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
