<p>Paspalum poeppigianum, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal and maritime environments.</p>
<p>Paspalum poeppigianum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
