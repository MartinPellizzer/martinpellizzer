                    <h1>Poa hydrophila</h1>
<p>Poa hydrophila, commonly known as the water meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, often waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
