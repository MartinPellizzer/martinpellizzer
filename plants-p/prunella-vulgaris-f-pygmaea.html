                    <h1>Prunella vulgaris f. pygmaea</h1>
<p>Prunella vulgaris f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf selfheal, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its small, compact rosettes of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces spikes of pale blue to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
