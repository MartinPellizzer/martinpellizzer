                    <h1>Piriqueta mandrarensis</h1>
<p>Piriqueta mandrarensis, commonly known as the Canary Island cypress, is a rare and endemic species native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous tree belonging to the Cupressaceae family, characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and scale-like leaves. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation to the arid and coastal climate of its native habitat, with a slow growth rate and deep root system. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable component of the island's biodiversity.</p>
