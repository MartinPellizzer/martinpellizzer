                    <h1>Phoradendron ottonis var. oblongifolium</h1>
<p>Phoradendron ottonis var. oblongifolium, commonly known as the Mexican dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It has small, scale-like leaves and produces yellow flowers with four petals. The plant is native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It typically grows on trees and shrubs, forming dense mats that can weaken its host.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and forest settings.</p>
