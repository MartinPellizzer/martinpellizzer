                    <h1>Pollinia praemorsa</h1>
<p>Pollinia praemorsa, commonly known as the death's-head hawkmoth pollinia, is a unique plant structure found in certain orchid species.</p>
<p>It consists of a mass of pollen grains fused into a single unit, which is adapted for specialized pollination by specific insect species. The pollinia are typically attached to the flower's stamen or other structures and are transferred to the pollinator's body during visitation. These structures are often brightly colored and shaped to facilitate attachment to the pollinator.</p>
<p>The botanical significance of pollinia praemorsa lies in its role in the mutualistic relationship between orchids and their pollinators.</p>
