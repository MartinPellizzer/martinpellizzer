                    <h1>Pyrethrum hispanicum</h1>
<p>Pyrethrum hispanicum, commonly known as Spanish pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which contain pyrethrinsâ€”natural insecticides. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Due to its pesticidal properties, it has been used historically in organic pest control.</p>
