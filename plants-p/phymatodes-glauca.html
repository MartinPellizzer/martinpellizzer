<p>Phymatodes glauca, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Phymatodes glauca is often found in prairies, woodlands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
