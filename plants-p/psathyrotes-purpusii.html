<p>Psathyrotes purpusii, commonly known as the Purpus's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant prefers cool, humid environments and is often found growing in shaded, forested areas. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the acidic, nutrient-poor soils of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Psathyrotes purpusii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
