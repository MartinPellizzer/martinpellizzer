                    <h1>Psammogeton biternatus var. villosus</h1>
<p>Psammogeton biternatus var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a mat-forming habit, characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its adaptations to sandy soils include a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>The hairy texture of its stems and leaves helps to reduce transpiration and protect against desiccation in harsh environments.</p>
