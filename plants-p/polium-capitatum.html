<p>Polium capitatum, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, hairy stems that branch near the base, supporting a dense cluster of small, pale green to yellowish flowering heads. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into small, oval-shaped seeds. Its leaves are narrow, often with a wavy margin, and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Polium capitatum is typically found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in sunny to partially shaded conditions.</p>
