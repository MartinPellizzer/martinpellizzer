<p>Phalaenopsis yingjiangensis, commonly known as the Yingjiang orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, long-lasting flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
