<p>Phegopteris henriquesii, commonly known as the Henriques' water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of southern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dennstaedtiaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
