                    <h1>Parathesis subcoriacea</h1>
<p>Parathesis subcoriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved parathesis, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, rough hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are often mistaken for those of other similar species due to their textured surface.</p>
<p>It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth.</p>
