                    <h1>Phaseolus vulgaris f. coerulescens</h1>
<p>Phaseolus vulgaris f. coerulescens, commonly known as the blue bean, is a botanical variant of the common bean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flower petals, which distinguish it from the typical green flowers of standard Phaseolus vulgaris. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family and is native to the Americas, where it has been cultivated for its ornamental value. Its foliage is usually dark green, and the leaves are heart-shaped with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>This cultivar is often grown in gardens for its aesthetic appeal rather than for culinary use.</p>
