<p>Prunus myrtifolia var. reflexa, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>

The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in coastal and urban landscapes.</p>
<p>Its adaptability and aesthetic appeal contribute to its use in horticulture and ecological restoration projects.</p>
