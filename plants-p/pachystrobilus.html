                    <h1>Pachystrobilus</h1>
<p>Pachystrobilus, commonly known as the giant pinecone or the giant clubmoss, is a genus of primitive vascular plants belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their elongated, club-like stems and spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. They thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate and tropical regions. Pachystrobilus species are typically small in size, with some reaching only a few centimeters in height.</p>
<p>Their ancient lineage provides valuable insights into the evolution of early land plants.</p>
