                    <h1>Panicum nemorosum var. uncinatum</h1>
<p>Panicum nemorosum var. uncinatum, commonly known as the hooked panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant features slender,丛生 stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets.</p>
<p>The hooked awns on the glumes are a distinguishing characteristic, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing.</p>
