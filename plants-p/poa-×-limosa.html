                    <h1>Poa × limosa</h1>
<p>Poa × limosa, commonly known as the hybrid meadowgrass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Poa annua and Poa trivialis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
