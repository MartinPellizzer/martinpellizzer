                    <h1>Psathyrostachys juncea var. desertorum</h1>
<p>Psathyrostachys juncea var. desertorum, commonly known as desert wild rye, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, which appear in early spring. It is well-suited for erosion control and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and supports biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
