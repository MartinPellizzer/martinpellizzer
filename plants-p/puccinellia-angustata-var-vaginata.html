<p>Puccinellia angustata var. vaginata, commonly known as narrowleaf glassworts, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, adapted to pollination by wind or insects. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and disturbed soils, demonstrating remarkable tolerance to high salinity and drought.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
