                    <h1>Polypodium multilineatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium multilineatum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its wiry, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Polypodium multilineatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to colonize difficult growing conditions.</p>
