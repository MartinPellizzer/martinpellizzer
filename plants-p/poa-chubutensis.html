<p>Poa chubutensis, commonly known as Chubut grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, Poa chubutensis is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
