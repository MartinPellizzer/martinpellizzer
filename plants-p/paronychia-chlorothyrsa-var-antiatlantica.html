                    <h1>Paronychia chlorothyrsa var. antiatlantica</h1>
<p>Paronychia chlorothyrsa var. antiatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic coast.</p>
<p>It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing dunes and supporting coastal biodiversity.</p>
