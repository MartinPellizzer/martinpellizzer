                    <h1>Pilosocereus occultiflorus</h1>
<p>Pilosocereus occultiflorus, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom at night, a feature that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to survive in extreme conditions with minimal water and high temperatures.</p>
