                    <h1>Potentilla confinis</h1>
<p>Potentilla confinis, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters, with many slender, woody stems. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>Potentilla confinis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
