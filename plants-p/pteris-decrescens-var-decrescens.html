                    <h1>Pteris decrescens var. decrescens</h1>
<p>Pteris decrescens var. decrescens, commonly known as the creeping water fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in wetlands. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its adaptability to wet conditions and is often used in horticulture for water gardens.</p>
