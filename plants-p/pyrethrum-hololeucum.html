<p>Pyrethrum hololeucum, commonly known as the white pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright white petals and yellow stamens, which give it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, spherical flower heads that contain numerous fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. These trichomes are the source of natural pyrethrins, which are used in organic insecticides.</p>
<p>Pyrethrum hololeucum typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun.</p>
