<p>Paphiopedilum guangdongense, commonly known as the Guangdong slipper orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped lip that is often brightly colored, typically in shades of yellow or green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
