<p>Plantago muelleri, commonly known as Mueller's plantain, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found at high elevations.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important species in ecological studies of alpine flora.</p>
