<p>Pteris caesia, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically covered in a fine, silvery coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce multiple shoots, allowing it to spread easily in suitable conditions.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi-lobed and may vary in size depending on the growing conditions.</p>
