                    <h1>Parthenium alpinum var. typicum</h1>
<p>Parthenium alpinum var. typicum, commonly known as the alpine ragwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish to brownish seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
