                    <h1>Plicosepalus somalensis</h1>
<p>Plicosepalus somalensis, commonly known as the Somali plicosepalus, is a rare flowering plant native to Somalia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, plicate (folded) sepals that give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
