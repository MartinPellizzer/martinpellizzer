                    <h1>Plantago correae</h1>
<p>Plantago correae, commonly known as the Correa's plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture and produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, cap-like structure called an urn, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations and its potential medicinal properties.</p>
