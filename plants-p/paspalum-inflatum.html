<p>Paspalum inflatum, commonly known as the inflated grass or purple paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to purplish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its roots form dense networks that help stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control.</p>
<p>Paspalum inflatum is often found in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats.</p>
