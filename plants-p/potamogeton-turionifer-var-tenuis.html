<p>Potamogeton turionifer var. tenuis, commonly known as narrowleaf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It has long, slender leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter wide, and it produces small, green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. It is characterized by its ability to form dense underwater stands, which can influence water quality and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Its turions, which are winter buds, help it survive in colder conditions and regrow in the spring.</p>
