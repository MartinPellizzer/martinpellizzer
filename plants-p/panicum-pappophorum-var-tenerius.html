                    <h1>Panicum pappophorum var. tenerius</h1>
<p>Panicum pappophorum var. tenerius, commonly known as velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its soft, velvety texture and ability to form dense clumps.</p>
