<p>Pultenaea, commonly known as the Australian gloryflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These shrubs are native to Australia and are characterized by their small, often clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The leaves are typically trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Pultenaea species are often found in dry, sandy soils and are adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>They are also valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
