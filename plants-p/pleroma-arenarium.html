                    <h1>Pleroma arenarium</h1>
<p>Pleroma arenarium, commonly known as the sand pleroma, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to arid and sandy environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth form and reduced foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a feature common in the Euphorbiaceae family. Its survival depends on specific soil conditions and limited water availability, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pleroma arenarium is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
