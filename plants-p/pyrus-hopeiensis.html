                    <h1>Pyrus hopeiensis</h1>
<p>Pyrus hopeiensis, commonly known as the Hope's pear, is a rare and critically endangered species native to China.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, dark grey bark and heart-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to common pears. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now found only in a few remote locations in the Qinling Mountains.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique botanical species.</p>
