                <h1>Pedicularis cranolopha</h1>
<p>Pedicularis cranolopha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red, often resembling orchids in appearance. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, typically growing in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
