<p>Puccinellia fasciculata var. scott-thomsonii, commonly known as the Scott-Thomson's spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has slender,丛生 stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are tightly clustered, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil in disturbed environments.</p>
