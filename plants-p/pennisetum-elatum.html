<p>Pennisetum elatum, commonly known as tall flatsedge, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne in panicles at the top of the stems. It thrives in wet or marshy environments and is often found in riparian zones or along waterways.</p>
<p>Pennisetum elatum is also used in some traditional practices and can serve as a food source for certain wildlife.</p>
