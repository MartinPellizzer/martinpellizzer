                    <h1>Phryne huetii</h1>
<p>Phryne huetii, commonly known as the Huetii's ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern resembling ghostly shapes. Its growth is slow, and it requires a humid, shaded environment to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts.</p>
