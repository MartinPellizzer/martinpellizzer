<p>Pleonotoma dendrotricha, commonly known as the tree bark beetle, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Curculionidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical body and a hard, often metallic-colored exoskeleton. This beetle is typically found on the bark of trees, where it feeds on the outer layers and sometimes the inner tissues. Its life cycle includes a larval stage that develops within the bark, feeding on the tree's tissues.</p>
<p>The species plays a role in the natural decomposition process of woody plants, contributing to nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.</p>
