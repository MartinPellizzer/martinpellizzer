                    <h1>Polypodium flagelliferum</h1>
<p>Polypodium flagelliferum, commonly known as the creeping polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often prostrate growth habit. The plant features fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments, with a distinctive, almost flagellate appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
