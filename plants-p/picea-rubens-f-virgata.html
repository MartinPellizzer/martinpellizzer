                    <h1>Picea rubens f. virgata</h1>
<p>Picea rubens f. virgata, commonly known as the white spruce, is a variant of the red spruce native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to white bark, which distinguishes it from the more commonly found red spruce. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking contrast to the pale bark. It produces cones that are usually pendulous, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and montane forest ecosystems.</p>
