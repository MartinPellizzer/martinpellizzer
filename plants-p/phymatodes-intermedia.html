                    <h1>Phymatodes intermedia</h1>
<p>Phymatodes intermedia, commonly known as the Texas knapweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions.</p>
