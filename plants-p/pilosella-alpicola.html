<p>Pilosella alpicola, commonly known as the alpine pilosella, is a low-growing flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Pilosella alpicola is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
