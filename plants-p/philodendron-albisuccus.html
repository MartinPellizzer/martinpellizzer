<p>Philodendron albisuccus, commonly known as the white-veined philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves with prominent white veins that create a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by orange-red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Philodendron albisuccus is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
