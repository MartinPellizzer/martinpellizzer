                    <h1>Phoradendron ligatum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron ligatum, commonly known as the mistletoe of the neotropics, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish berries that are an important food source for various birds. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature and unique ecological role make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
