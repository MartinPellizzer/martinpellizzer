                    <h1>Pyrola crypta</h1>
<p>Pyrola crypta, commonly known as the ghost pepper or the cryptic pyrola, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the understory of temperate forests in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and its dark, glossy leaves that help it absorb limited sunlight. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soil and requires a cool, shaded environment to flourish. Pyrola crypta is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
