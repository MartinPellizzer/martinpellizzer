                    <h1>Phoradendron tetrapterum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron tetrapterum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. It is found in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of the Americas.</p>
<p>Its growth is often associated with specific host species, such as oaks and other hardwoods.</p>
