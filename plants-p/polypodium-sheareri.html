                    <h1>Polypodium sheareri</h1>
<p>Polypodium sheareri, commonly known as the serrate holly fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>The fern produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in groups.</p>
