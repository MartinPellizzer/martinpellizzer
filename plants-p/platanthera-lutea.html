                    <h1>Platanthera lutea</h1>
<p>Platanthera lutea, commonly known as the yellow lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and a long, spiraled inflorescence of pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
