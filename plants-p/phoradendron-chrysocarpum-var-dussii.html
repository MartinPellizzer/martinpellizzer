                    <h1>Phoradendron chrysocarpum var. dussii</h1>
<p>Phoradendron chrysocarpum var. dussii, commonly known as the golden fruit mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, opposite, ovate leaves and produces yellowish-orange berries that are an important food source for birds. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, facilitating its spread to new hosts.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting avian populations and its unique parasitic relationship with its host trees.</p>
