                    <h1>Petrocosmea hexiensis</h1>
<p>Petrocosmea hexiensis, commonly known as the Hexi petrocosmea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded habitats. Its leaves are usually opposite and oval-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Petrocosmea hexiensis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
