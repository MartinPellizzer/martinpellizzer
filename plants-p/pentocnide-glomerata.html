                    <h1>Pentocnide glomerata</h1>
<p>Pentocnide glomerata, commonly known as the clustered sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and has been traditionally used in incense and fine woodworking.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
