                    <h1>Paspalum trachycoleon</h1>
<p>Paspalum trachycoleon, commonly known as the rough paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, wiry foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in wetland and marshy environments, often forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable habitat for wildlife and a potential invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
<p>Paspalum trachycoleon is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience.</p>
