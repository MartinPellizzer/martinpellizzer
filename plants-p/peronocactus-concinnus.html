                    <h1>Peronocactus concinnus</h1>
<p>Peronocactus concinnus, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem with closely spaced, narrow ribs and a dense covering of white to pale green spines. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
