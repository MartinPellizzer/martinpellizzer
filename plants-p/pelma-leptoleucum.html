<p>Pelma leptoleucum, commonly known as the white-leaved pelma, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the cooler months. Pelma leptoleucum is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
