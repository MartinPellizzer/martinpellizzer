<p>Primula erratica, commonly known as the wandering primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant features basal rosettes of broad, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers in shades of yellow, white, or pink. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
