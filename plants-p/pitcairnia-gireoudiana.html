                    <h1>Pitcairnia gireoudiana</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia gireoudiana, commonly known as the Gireoud's pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of long, spiky, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, often in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
