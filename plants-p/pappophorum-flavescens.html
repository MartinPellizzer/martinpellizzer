<p>Pappophorum flavescens, commonly known as the yellow pappus grass, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, feathery bracts, which aid in wind dispersal of its seeds. It typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
