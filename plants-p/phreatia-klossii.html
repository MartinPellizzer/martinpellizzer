<p>Phreatia klossii, commonly known as the Kloss's orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the lowland rainforests of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its long, drooping inflorescences bearing numerous fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Phreatia klossii is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
