                    <h1>Ptychosperma pullenii</h1>
<p>Ptychosperma pullenii, commonly known as the African cycad, is a slow-growing, evergreen cycad native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a stout, unbranched trunk with a fibrous, spongy bark and a crown of stiff, sword-shaped leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces large, showy cones, with male and female cones on separate plants, a characteristic of gymnosperms. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is often cultivated as a statement plant in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
