                    <h1>Pityrogramma pearcei</h1>
<p>Pityrogramma pearcei, commonly known as the pearce's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are often covered in fine, hair-like structures that aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The fronds are bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that contribute to its overall ornamental appearance.</p>
