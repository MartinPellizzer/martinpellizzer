<p>Phelypaea serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged. It produces tiny, greenish flowers that bloom late in the growing season, usually in late summer or early autumn.</p>
<p>Phelypaea serotina plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
