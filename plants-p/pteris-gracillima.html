                    <h1>Pteris gracillima</h1>
<p>Pteris gracillima, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arched or semi-circular in shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to moist substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates.</p>
