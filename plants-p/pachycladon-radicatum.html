                    <h1>Pachycladon radicatum</h1>
<p>Pachycladon radicatum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a member of the Burseraceae family and is native to the arid regions of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, exhibiting a slow growth rate and long lifespan. The plant is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are small and yellowish-green, often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and slow growth, Pachycladon radicatum is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
