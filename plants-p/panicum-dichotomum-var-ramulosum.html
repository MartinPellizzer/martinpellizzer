<p>Panicum dichotomum var. ramulosum, commonly known as the tufted panicgrass, is a grass species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often branch at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, two-lobed florets. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy.</p>
