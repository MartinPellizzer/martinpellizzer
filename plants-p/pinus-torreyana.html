                    <h1>Pinus torreyana</h1>
<p>Pinus torreyana, commonly known as Torrey pine, is a rare and endangered conifer native to southern California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 inches long. The tree produces cones that range from 2 to 4 inches in length, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in coastal scrub habitats and is adapted to mild, Mediterranean climates with dry summers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered one of the rarest pine species in the world.</p>
