                    <h1>Porcellites helveticus</h1>
<p>Porcellites helveticus, commonly known as the Swiss porcellite, is a rare and unique plant species native to the alpine regions of Switzerland.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and features small, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Porcellites helveticus is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
