                    <h1>Pinus corsica var. pendula</h1>
<p>Pinus corsica var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping Corsican pine, is a unique variant of the Corsican pine characterized by its cascading, drooping branches.</p>
<p>This coniferous tree is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast against the dark bark. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appearance, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its distinctive, flowing form.</p>
