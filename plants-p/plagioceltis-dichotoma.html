<p>Plagioceltis dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and dense clusters of scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically found at the base of the foliage. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
