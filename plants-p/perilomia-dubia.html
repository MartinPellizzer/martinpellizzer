                    <h1>Perilomia dubia</h1>
<p>Perilomia dubia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the humid rainforests of northeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the light, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant has a short flowering period, typically during the wet season, when it produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in the moist, shaded environments where it grows.</p>
<p>Perilomia dubia is also notable for its unique seed dispersal mechanism, which relies on the movement of small mammals in its native habitat.</p>
