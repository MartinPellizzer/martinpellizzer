                    <h1>Phelypaea concolor</h1>
<p>Phelypaea concolor, commonly known as the smooth water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically smooth and lack the hairy texture found in many other fern species. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Phelypaea concolor plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality through its natural filtration properties.</p>
