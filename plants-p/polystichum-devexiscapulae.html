                    <h1>Polystichum devexiscapulae</h1>
<p>Polystichum devexiscapulae, commonly known as the twisted-capped wood fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the temperate forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that grow in a compact, upright form. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its unique, twisted spore-bearing structures, or sorus, are positioned along the margins of the fronds, distinguishing it from other fern species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Polystichum devexiscapulae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
