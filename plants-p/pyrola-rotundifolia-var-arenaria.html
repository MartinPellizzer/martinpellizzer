                    <h1>Pyrola rotundifolia var. arenaria</h1>
<p>Pyrola rotundifolia var. arenaria, commonly known as the sand pink, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to sandy and acidic soils in northern regions.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered leaves that are oval-shaped and densely packed, giving it a mat-like appearance. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in heathlands and open woodlands, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
