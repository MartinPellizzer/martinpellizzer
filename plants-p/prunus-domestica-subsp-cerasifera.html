<p>Prunus domestica subsp.</p>
<p>cerasifera, commonly known as the wild cherry or European black cherry, is a species of shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 5â€“10 meters, featuring a slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and dense, dark green foliage.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries that mature in late summer. Its leaves are oval with serrated edges, and the bark is smooth and reddish-brown when young, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine and as a food source.</p>
