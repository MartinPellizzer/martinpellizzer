<p>Pleopeltis senescens, commonly known as the old man's beard fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, cascading fronds that resemble flowing hair, giving it its common name. The plant has a fibrous root system that allows it to attach to trees and other surfaces in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments.</p>
<p>Pleopeltis senescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
