<p>Picea abies f. gregoryana, commonly known as the Gregory's Norway spruce, is a botanical variant of the Norway spruce, characterized by its unique growth form and foliage.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing evergreen conifer that typically forms dense, compact clumps, often appearing as a shrub rather than a tree. The foliage is dark green and densely packed, with needle-like leaves that are slightly shorter than those of the typical Norway spruce. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and Pyrenees, where it thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its distinctive appearance.</p>
