                    <h1>Physedra heterophylla var. hookeri</h1>
<p>Physedra heterophylla var. hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are usually thin and ribbon-like, adapting to its aquatic environment.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its unique morphology and specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
