<p>Pteris rasoloheryana, commonly known as the Madagascar water fern, is a rare species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with finely divided, linear pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. It thrives in wet, shady environments, typically near streams or in marshy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
