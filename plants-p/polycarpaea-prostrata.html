<p>Polycarpaea prostrata, commonly known as creeping polycarpaea, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall rugged appearance.</p>
<p>Polycarpaea prostrata is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
