<p>Papaver rhoeas f. subbipinnatifidum, commonly known as the double-flowered poppy, is a botanical variant of the common poppy.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, double-layered flowers that are more elaborate than those of the typical Papaver rhoeas. The plant features showy, bright red petals arranged in a dense, almost spherical formation. It retains the basic structure of the parent species, including the capsule-like seed pod.</p>
<p>This cultivar is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and floral arrangements.</p>
