<p>Primula barbatula, commonly known as the beard-tongue primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a hairy texture, and its flowers are typically pink or purple, arranged in a loose cluster. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming habit.</p>
