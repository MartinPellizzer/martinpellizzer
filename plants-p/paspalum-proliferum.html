<p>Paspalum proliferum, commonly known as the spreading paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Paspalum proliferum is often used in landscaping for erosion control due to its hardy nature and rapid spread.</p>
