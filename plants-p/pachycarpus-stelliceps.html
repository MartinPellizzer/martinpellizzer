<p>Pachycarpus stelliceps, commonly known as the star-headed cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange, adding a vibrant touch to its desert habitat. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Pachycarpus stelliceps is well adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient and fascinating example of desert flora.</p>
