                    <h1>Psammopyrum</h1>
<p>Psammopyrum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to southern Africa and are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. They typically have small, hairy leaves and produce showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white. Psammopyrum species are often found growing on sandy or rocky soils, and they play a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology and ecological adaptations make them important components of their native ecosystems.</p>
