<p>Parietaria officinalis var. fallax, commonly known as the fallax variant of the common rockweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. It is known for its allergenic potential due to the presence of certain pollen grains.</p>
