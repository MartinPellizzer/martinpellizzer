                    <h1>Pinguicula flos-mulionis</h1>
<p>Pinguicula flos-mulionis, commonly known as the mullein butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small insects. The plant produces a single, showy floral spike that bears small, white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as both a predator and a plant species.</p>
