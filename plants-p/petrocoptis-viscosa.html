                    <h1>Petrocoptis viscosa</h1>
<p>Petrocoptis viscosa, commonly known as the sticky petrocoptis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its root system is extensive and adapted for water storage, allowing it to survive prolonged dry periods.</p>
<p>Petrocoptis viscosa is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
