                    <h1>Pallenis spinosa var. subacaulis</h1>
<p>Pallenis spinosa var. subacaulis, commonly known as the slender spurge, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from intense sunlight.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability.</p>
