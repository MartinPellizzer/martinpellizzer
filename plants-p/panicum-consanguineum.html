                    <h1>Panicum consanguineum</h1>
<p>Panicum consanguineum, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often turn reddish in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in disturbed areas and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats make it an effective ground cover in certain ecological settings.</p>
