                    <h1>Phlegmariurus tauri</h1>
<p>Phlegmariurus tauri, commonly known as the Taurian clubmoss, is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and branching stems.</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, with the sporophyte stage being the dominant phase in its life cycle. It has a historical significance in paleobotany due to its resemblance to ancient plant forms.</p>
<p>Phlegmariurus tauri is relatively rare and is often used as an indicator of undisturbed, humid ecosystems.</p>
