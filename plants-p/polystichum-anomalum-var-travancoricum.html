<p>Polystichum anomalum var. travancoricum, commonly known as the Travancore holly fern, is a rare and ornamental fern native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a membranous covering.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its unique foliage and is often cultivated in specialized horticultural collections.</p>
