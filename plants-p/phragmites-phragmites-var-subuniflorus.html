                    <h1>Phragmites phragmites var. subuniflorus</h1>
<p>Phragmites phragmites var. subuniflorus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved common reed, is a variant of the common reed found in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is a tall, perennial grass that typically grows in dense stands along the edges of ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant has narrow, blade-like leaves and produces fluffy, white plumes that are characteristic of the genus Phragmites. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a common and sometimes invasive species in wetland ecosystems.</p>
