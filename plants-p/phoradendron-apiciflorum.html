                    <h1>Phoradendron apiciflorum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron apiciflorum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, forming dense clusters on its host.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken the host tree if left unchecked.</p>
