                    <h1>Pteris indica</h1>
<p>Pteris indica, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically biennial, with the first year producing only roots and the second year producing spore-bearing fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, making it an effective ground cover in wetlands.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy and ecological role in aquatic habitats.</p>
