                    <h1>Pinus sylvestris proles scotica</h1>
<p>Pinus sylvestris proles scotica, commonly known as the Scottish pine, is a subspecies of the Scots pine native to the British Isles.</p>
<p>It is a tall, coniferous evergreen tree with needle-like leaves and cone-bearing characteristics typical of the Pinaceae family. The tree produces both male and female cones, with the female cones developing into woody seed capsules that release seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to the rugged, windswept landscapes of Scotland, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
