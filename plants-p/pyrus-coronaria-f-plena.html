                    <h1>Pyrus coronaria f. plena</h1>
<p>Pyrus coronaria f. plena, commonly known as the double-flowered common pear, is a cultivar of the common pear tree characterized by its abundant, double blooms.</p>
<p>It produces large, showy flowers with numerous petals, giving it a more ornamental appearance than the typical single-flowered variety. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in autumn, and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>The fruit, while edible, is generally smaller and less flavorful compared to the standard Pyrus coronaria.</p>
