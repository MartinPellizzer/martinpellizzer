                    <h1>Poa flexuosa var. contracta</h1>
<p>Poa flexuosa var. contracta, commonly known as the curled bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that often curl at the tips. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its compact form and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
