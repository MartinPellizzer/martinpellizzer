<p>Pinanga capitata var. capitata, commonly known as the helmet fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its distinctive, compact growth habit and clustered fronds. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in a specific pattern on the underside of the fronds. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in humid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded garden settings.</p>
