                    <h1>Phalaenopsis ruckeriana</h1>
<p>Phalaenopsis ruckeriana, commonly known as the Rucker's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other objects without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often resembling moth wings, which is why it is part of the Phalaenopsis genus. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Its relatively low maintenance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
