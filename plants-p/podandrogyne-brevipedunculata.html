<p>Podandrogyne brevipedunculata, commonly known as the short-stemmed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of short peduncles. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is adapted to thrive in sandy soils with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in semi-arid environments.</p>
