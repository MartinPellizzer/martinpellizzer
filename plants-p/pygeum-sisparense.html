<p>Pygeum sisparense, commonly known as the African prickly pear, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible fruits resembling small, green figs. Its thick, waxy cuticle helps it retain moisture in dry environments.</p>
<p>Pygeum sisparense is adapted to survive in harsh, semi-desert conditions with minimal water availability.</p>
