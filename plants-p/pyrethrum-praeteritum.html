                    <h1>Pyrethrum praeteritum</h1>
<p>Pyrethrum praeteritum, commonly known as the ancient pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which contain the natural insecticides pyrethrins. These compounds make it an effective botanical pesticide, historically used for pest control.</p>
<p>Its cultivation has declined due to the labor-intensive process of extracting the active compounds.</p>
