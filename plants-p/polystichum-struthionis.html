<p>Polystichum struthionis, commonly known as the giant sword fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi-directionally arranged, with the fertile spore-bearing structures located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
