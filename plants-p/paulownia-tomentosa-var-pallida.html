<p>Paulownia tomentosa var. pallida, commonly known as the silver Paulownia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in early spring, typically in shades of pink to purple. Its wood is lightweight and strong, making it valuable for crafting and musical instruments.</p>
