<p>Polygonum salsuginosum, commonly known as saltgrass, is a flowering plant species native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes buckwheat and other related plants. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, clustered flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Polygonum salsuginosum is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline soils where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
