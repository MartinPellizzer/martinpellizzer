<p>Poa sublanata subsp.</p>
<p>vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous bentgrass, is a flowering plant species belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in moist, temperate environments such as meadows and wetlands.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences, and its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like. One notable feature is its ability to reproduce vegetatively through vivipary, where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
<p>This trait allows it to spread rapidly in suitable habitats.</p>
