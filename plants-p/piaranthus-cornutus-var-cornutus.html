                    <h1>Piaranthus cornutus var. cornutus</h1>
<p>Piaranthus cornutus var. cornutus, commonly known as the horned pincushion, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with dense, fleshy leaves that form a spherical shape. The plant produces striking, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
