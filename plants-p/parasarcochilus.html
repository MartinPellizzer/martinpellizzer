                    <h1>Parasarcochilus</h1>
<p>Parasarcochilus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, translucent leaves and delicate, white or pale green flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical features make it highly specialized, requiring specific humidity and light conditions to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Parasarcochilus is considered a conservation concern.</p>
