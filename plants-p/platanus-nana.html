                    <h1>Platanus nana</h1>
<p>Platanus nana, commonly known as the dwarf plane tree, is a small, slow-growing tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that are typically 5â€“9 inches in diameter. The tree produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Platanus nana is often used in urban landscaping due to its tolerance of pollution and compact size.</p>
