<p>Pollinia ciliata subsp.</p>
<p>seminuda, commonly known as the slender fringe orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, elongated inflorescences and distinctive, ciliate (fringed) petals.</p>
<p>The plant produces pollinia, which are compact masses of pollen, a unique feature of orchids that facilitates specific pollination mechanisms. Its habitat is typically moist, open woodlands, where it thrives in partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
