<p>Pleione arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal lily, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces a single, often fragrant flower with a distinctive spurred lip, which is a common feature among orchids. It thrives in cool, moist mountainous environments and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
