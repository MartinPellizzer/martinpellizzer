                    <h1>Pteroceras pricei</h1>
<p>Pteroceras pricei, commonly known as the Price's pteroceras, is a rare and unique fern-like plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteroceratopsidae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that resemble those of a fern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on wind pollination for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pteroceras pricei is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
