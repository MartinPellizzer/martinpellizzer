                    <h1>Poa attenuata var. desertorum</h1>
<p>Poa attenuata var. desertorum, commonly known as the desert bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, which allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its deep root system enables it to access moisture from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>This species is often found in rocky soils and is a key component of native grassland ecosystems in desert regions.</p>
