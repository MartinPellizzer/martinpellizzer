                    <h1>Pinus praetermissa</h1>
<p>Pinus praetermissa, commonly known as the Mexican white pine, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
