                    <h1>Pycnophyllum holleanum</h1>
<p>Pycnophyllum holleanum, commonly known as the Holleanum mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves and small, white flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically eaten by birds, which then disperse its seeds. It is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the health of its host trees.</p>
