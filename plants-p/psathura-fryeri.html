                    <h1>Psathura fryeri</h1>
<p>Psathura fryeri, commonly known as the Fryer's psathura, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, often in clusters at the top of the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded, forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Psathura fryeri is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
