                    <h1>Platostoma africanum</h1>
<p>Platostoma africanum, commonly known as the African flat lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a unique combination of fungal and algal components.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its flat, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to its substrate. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found on rocks and tree bark in sub-Saharan Africa. Its structure is composed of a fungal mycelium intertwined with photosynthetic algae, which together perform essential metabolic functions.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, Platostoma africanum plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its environment.</p>
