                    <h1>Portulacaria longipedunculata</h1>
<p>Portulacaria longipedunculata, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers during the warmer months. Its stems are branched and can become woody with age, and it is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature.</p>
<p>Portulacaria longipedunculata is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it an ideal choice for xeriscaping.</p>
