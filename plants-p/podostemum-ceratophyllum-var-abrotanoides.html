                    <h1>Podostemum ceratophyllum var. abrotanoides</h1>
<p>Podostemum ceratophyllum var. abrotanoides, commonly known as the African water plantain, is a unique aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, with a broad, heart-shaped base. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that emerge from the water surface, often in clusters. It thrives in slow-moving or still waters with rich organic substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
