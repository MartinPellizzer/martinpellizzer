                    <h1>Pinus cretacea</h1>
<p>Pinus cretacea, commonly known as the Cretaceous pine, is a fossilized conifer that lived during the Cretaceous period.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone structures, which are preserved in sedimentary rock. This plant is significant in paleobotanical studies due to its role in understanding ancient ecosystems. Its morphology provides insights into the evolution of coniferous plants.</p>
<p>The study of Pinus cretacea helps scientists reconstruct past climates and environmental conditions.</p>
