                    <h1>Potamogeton × maemetsiae</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × maemetsiae, commonly known as the hybrid water plantain, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Potamogeton perfoliatus and Potamogeton crispus.</p>
<p>It is a submerged aquatic plant characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically arranged in spike-like clusters. It is found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
