<p>Polypodium venturii, commonly known as the Venturi's fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into small, overlapping segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it attaches to rocks or tree trunks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>Polypodium venturii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
