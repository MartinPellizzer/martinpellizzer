                    <h1>Pimpinella domingensis</h1>
<p>Pimpinella domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It is native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white flowers that attract pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in a hairy, ribbed fruit, typical of the genus Pimpinella.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
