                    <h1>Peltaea macedoi</h1>
<p>Peltaea macedoi, commonly known as the Macedonian shield-fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the mountainous regions of North Macedonia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories at higher elevations. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Peltaea macedoi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
