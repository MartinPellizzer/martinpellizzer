<p>Panicum longiculme, commonly known as the long-bracted panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are often adorned with long, bract-like structures. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open woodlands and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects.</p>
