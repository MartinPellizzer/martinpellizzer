                    <h1>Polybotrya appendiculata var. subintegra</h1>
<p>Polybotrya appendiculata var. subintegra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ghost fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that often form a dense, carpet-like ground cover. The fronds are typically dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in length and structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth where it contributes to the understory vegetation.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat.</p>
