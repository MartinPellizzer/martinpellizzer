<p>Phoradendron villosum subsp.</p>
<p>flavum, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually yellow-green in color, and its flowers are white or pale yellow, often appearing in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the berries and later excrete the seeds onto new host trees.</p>
