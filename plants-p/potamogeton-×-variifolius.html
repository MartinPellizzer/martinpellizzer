                    <h1>Potamogeton × variifolius</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × variifolius, commonly known as the variable pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant that exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, Potamogeton perfoliatus and Potamogeton crispus.</p>
<p>It is typically found in freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers, where it forms dense underwater vegetation. The plant has long, narrow leaves that can vary in shape, often appearing lanceolate to ovate, which contributes to its common name. It produces small, green flowers that are usually arranged in spikes, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and fish.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it can be challenging to distinguish from its parent species in the field.</p>
