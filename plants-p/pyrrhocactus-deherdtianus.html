                    <h1>Pyrrhocactus deherdtianus</h1>
<p>Pyrrhocactus deherdtianus, commonly known as the Deherdt's pyrrhocactus, is a rare cactus species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warm season, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
