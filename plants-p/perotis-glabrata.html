                    <h1>Perotis glabrata</h1>
<p>Perotis glabrata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapting well to harsh, dry environments. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. Its yellow flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Perotis glabrata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
