                    <h1>Primula cortusoides var. striata</h1>
<p>Primula cortusoides var. striata, commonly known as the striped primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers have five petals and are arranged in a raceme, with a distinctive striped pattern on the petals that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
