<p>Pereskia poeppigii, commonly known as the Candelabra Cactus, is a unique species native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered in a layer of pale, waxy skin. Unlike most cacti, it produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pink in color. The plant is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems.</p>
<p>Its structure resembles a shrub more than a typical cactus, with leaves that are often reduced to spines.</p>
