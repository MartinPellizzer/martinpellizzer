<p>Pilitis acerosa, commonly known as the hard-leaved pilitis, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming during the warm seasons. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for cultivation in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its unique foliage and modest flowering, it is occasionally grown as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens.</p>
