<p>Persoonia manotricha, commonly known as the woolly pear.</p>
<p>It is a shrub native to Western Australia, characterized by its distinctive, woolly, silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Persoonia manotricha is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands.</p>
