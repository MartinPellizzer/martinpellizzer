<p>Paspalum longipedicellatum, commonly known as the long-awned paspalum, is a grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets with long, slender awns, which are bristle-like structures that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshy areas or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
