<p>Ptilotus spicatus subsp.</p>
<p>burbidgeanus, commonly known as the burbidgean spinifex, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with distinctive, spiky, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes.</p>
