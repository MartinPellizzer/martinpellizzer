                    <h1>Panicum radicans</h1>
<p>Panicum radicans, commonly known as spreading panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread aggressively across open areas. The plant produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Its slender, grass-like leaves are typically green and slightly hairy.</p>
<p>Panicum radicans is often found in wetland environments and is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels.</p>
