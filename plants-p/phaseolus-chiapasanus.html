                    <h1>Phaseolus chiapasanus</h1>
<p>Phaseolus chiapasanus, commonly known as the Chiapas bean, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes known for their nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several edible seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, typical of many Phaseolus species, and the plant is often cultivated for its nutritional value.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the genus.</p>
