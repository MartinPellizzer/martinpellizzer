                    <h1>Pleurothallis pan</h1>
<p>Pleurothallis pan, commonly known as the pan orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on air and rain for nourishment rather than soil. It produces small, delicate flowers that are often white or pale yellow, with a subtle fragrance. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves and is well adapted to humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by enthusiasts, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade.</p>
