                    <h1>Poa scheuchzeri</h1>
<p>Poa scheuchzeri, commonly known as the Scheuchzer's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and other mountainous areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Poa scheuchzeri is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
