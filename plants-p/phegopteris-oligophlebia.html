                <h1>Phegopteris oligophlebia</h1>
<p>Phegopteris oligophlebia, commonly known as the narrow-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged or partially submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense mats, which help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, narrow venation pattern that distinguishes it from similar species.</p>
