<p>Picea intercedens, commonly known as the Sitka spruce, is a tall evergreen conifer native to the northern Pacific coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against environmental stress.</p>
<p>The Sitka spruce is well adapted to coastal conditions, including high winds and salt spray.</p>
