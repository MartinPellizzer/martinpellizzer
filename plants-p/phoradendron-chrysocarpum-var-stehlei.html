                    <h1>Phoradendron chrysocarpum var. stehlei</h1>
<p>Phoradendron chrysocarpum var. stehlei, commonly known as the golden fruit mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces yellowish-green berries that contain sticky seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its vascular system allows it to extract water and nutrients from its host, while still performing some photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting bird populations through its fruiting habit.</p>
