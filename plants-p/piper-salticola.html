                    <h1>Piper salticola</h1>
<p>Piper salticola, commonly known as the jumping cucumber, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into elongated, cucumber-like fruits. The fruits are edible and have a slightly bitter taste, often used in local cuisines.</p>
<p>Its common name stems from the way the fruits can bounce or "jump" when dropped due to their hollow, fibrous structure.</p>
