<p>Pinus pinaster subsp.</p>
<p>minor, commonly known as the Corsican pine, is a subspecies native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer with needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid than those of the typical *Pinus pinaster*.</p>
<p>The cones are woody and contain two-winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in coastal or mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of Mediterranean forests and woodlands.</p>
