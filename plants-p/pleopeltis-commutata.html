                    <h1>Pleopeltis commutata</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis commutata, commonly known as the veined rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive veining pattern. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which help it absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually pinnately divided, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention.</p>
