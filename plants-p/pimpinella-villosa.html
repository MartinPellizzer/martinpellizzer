<p>Pimpinella villosa, commonly known as hairy cow-weed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils across North America. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves covered in soft, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small white or greenish flowers are arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Pimpinella villosa is often found in open fields, along roadsides, and in woodland edges, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
