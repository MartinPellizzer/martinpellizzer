                    <h1>Poa alpina var. supina</h1>
<p>Poa alpina var. supina, commonly known as the creeping alpine grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh climates, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
