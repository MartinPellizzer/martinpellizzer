<p>Potamogeton natans subsp.</p>
<p>fluitans, commonly known as the floating pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, oval leaves that are often arranged in whorls.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are usually submerged or just at the water's surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions, altering water quality and competing with native species.</p>
