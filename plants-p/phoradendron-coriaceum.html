                    <h1>Phoradendron coriaceum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron coriaceum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted for this parasitic lifestyle. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that are often consumed by birds, which then spread its seeds to new hosts. Its evergreen foliage and fleshy berries make it a distinctive component of forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Phoradendron coriaceum plays a role in both ecological interactions and traditional cultural practices.</p>
