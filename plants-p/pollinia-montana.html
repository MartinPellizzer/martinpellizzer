                    <h1>Pollinia montana</h1>
<p>Pollinia montana, commonly known as the mountain pollinia, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique pollination mechanism, where the pollen is aggregated into compact, sticky masses called pollinia. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions with its compact growth form. Its flowers are usually small and have a complex structure, with specialized structures that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pollinia montana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
