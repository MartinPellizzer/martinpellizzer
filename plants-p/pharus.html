                    <h1>Pharus</h1>
<p>Pharus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their striking blue or violet flowers and are often found in coastal areas. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting glands, which helps them adapt to saline environments. Pharus species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their attractive appearance and hardiness.</p>
<p>They play an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and preventing soil erosion.</p>
