<p>Poa pratensis subsp.</p>
<p>alpestris, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its leaves are narrow, hairless, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and aesthetic qualities.</p>
