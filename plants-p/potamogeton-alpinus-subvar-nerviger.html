<p>Potamogeton alpinus subvar. nerviger, commonly known as the alpine pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to cold, freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically narrow and have distinct veins. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it thrives in nutrient-rich, shallow waters. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for cooler climates, it is often found in mountain lakes and streams.</p>
