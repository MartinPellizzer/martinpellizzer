<p>Phaseolus vulgaris var. atrocoerulescens, commonly known as the dark blue runner bean, is a striking variant of the common bean species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deep indigo to black pod coloration, which becomes more intense as the pods mature. The plant typically grows as an annual vine, reaching lengths of up to 3 meters, with heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. Its unique coloration makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it is also cultivated for its edible pods.</p>
<p>This variety is native to the Americas and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
