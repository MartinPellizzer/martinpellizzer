The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its humid, shaded habitat. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a delicate species that is highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
