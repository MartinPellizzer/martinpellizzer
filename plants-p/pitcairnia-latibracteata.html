                    <h1>Pitcairnia latibracteata</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia latibracteata, commonly known as the broad-bract pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a common feature among bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with bright red flowers that bloom in the spring. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and provide some protection against herbivores.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>
