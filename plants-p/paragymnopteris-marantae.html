<p>Paragymnopteris marantae, commonly known as the Marantae shield fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in high humidity. Its fronds are often bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant's reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
