<p>Platystele napintzae, commonly known as the Napintzae ghost orchid, is a rare and critically endangered species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid that grows in shaded, humid environments, typically on the forest floor. The plant produces delicate, white flowers with a distinctive, elongated shape, and it lacks leaves, relying entirely on its roots for photosynthesis. Platystele napintzae is part of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology and specialized habitat requirements.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
