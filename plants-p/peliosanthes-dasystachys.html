                    <h1>Peliosanthes dasystachys</h1>
<p>Peliosanthes dasystachys, commonly known as the giant sago palm, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in large, branched clusters, followed by orange-red fruits containing three seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to environmental stress, it requires careful care and is sometimes considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
