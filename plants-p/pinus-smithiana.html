<p>Pinus smithiana, commonly known as the Smith's pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces cones that are cylindrical and often persist on the branches for several years. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Pinus smithiana is considered a valuable species for ecological and botanical study.</p>
