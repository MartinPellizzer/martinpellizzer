<p>Polypodium heteromorphum, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, which can range from pinnate to bipinnate, depending on environmental conditions. The fronds are typically leathery and dark green, with a distinctive holly-like appearance due to their serrated margins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant reproduces via spores, which are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia.</p>
