<p>Pneumatopteris papuana, commonly known as the Papuan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its spores are released into the air, allowing for dispersal over considerable distances.</p>
<p>The fronds are often divided into small, lobed segments, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
