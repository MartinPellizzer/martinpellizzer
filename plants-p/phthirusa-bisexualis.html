<p>Phthirusa bisexualis, commonly known as the two-sexed lichen, is a unique species belonging to the family Pilocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thalloid structure, which consists of a flat, leaf-like body composed of interwoven filaments. The plant exhibits a dimorphic life cycle, with distinct male and female reproductive structures on the same thallus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on decaying wood or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its reproductive strategy involves the production of specialized spores that are dispersed by wind, facilitating its colonization of new substrates.</p>
