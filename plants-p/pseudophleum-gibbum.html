                    <h1>Pseudophleum gibbum</h1>
<p>Pseudophleum gibbum, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and forest edges. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Pseudophleum gibbum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
