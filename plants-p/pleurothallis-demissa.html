                    <h1>Pleurothallis demissa</h1>
<p>Pleurothallis demissa, commonly known as the "ghost orchid," is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has small, delicate green leaves and produces fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. It is characterized by its unique, slender pseudobulbs and intricate root system adapted for absorbing moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
