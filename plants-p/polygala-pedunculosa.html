<p>Polygala pedunculosa, commonly known as the clustered milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
