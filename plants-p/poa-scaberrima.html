                    <h1>Poa scaberrima</h1>
<p>Poa scaberrima, commonly known as rough bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, Poa scaberrima is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
