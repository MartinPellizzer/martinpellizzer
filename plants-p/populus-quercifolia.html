                    <h1>Populus quercifolia</h1>
<p>Populus quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaf poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of the oak tree, with coarsely toothed margins. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Populus quercifolia is often found in riparian zones and is valued for its ecological benefits and ornamental features.</p>
