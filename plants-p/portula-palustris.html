                    <h1>Portula palustris</h1>
<p>Portula palustris, commonly known as swamp stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in its arid habitats. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in moist or swampy areas.</p>
<p>Portula palustris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in wet conditions.</p>
