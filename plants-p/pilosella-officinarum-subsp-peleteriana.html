<p>Pilosella officinarum subsp.</p>
<p>peleteriana, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands at high elevations.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>
