                            <h1>Pedicularis Pyramidata Subsp. Multiflora</h1>
<p>Multiflora lousewort, scientifically known as Pedicularis pyramidata subsp. multiflora, is a striking member of the Orobanchaceae family native to the mountainous regions of western North America. This unique plant is characterized by its vivid red and orange flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes, often growing in association with coniferous trees. Despite its beauty, it is a parasitic species that draws nutrients from its host plants, making it an important subject for ecological study. Its rarity and specialized habitat make it a fascinating and vulnerable species worth conservation efforts.</p>
