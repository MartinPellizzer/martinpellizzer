                    <h1>Parsonsia procumbens</h1>
<p>Parsonsia procumbens, commonly known as the stilted flame vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a trailing or climbing shrub that produces vibrant orange-red flowers, which are tubular and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant has slender, often woody stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb supports. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
