<p>Paspalum crustarium, commonly known as the creeping paspalum, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southern United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths that spread along the ground, often in moist or wetland habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are usually green or reddish in color. It is adapted to thrive in humid environments and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Paspalum crustarium is also noted for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and frequent flooding.</p>
