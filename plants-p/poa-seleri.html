                    <h1>Poa seleri</h1>
<p>Poa seleri, commonly known as seler's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks.</p>
<p>Poa seleri is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
