                    <h1>Polycarpon tetraphyllum var. fontqueri</h1>
<p>Polycarpon tetraphyllum var. fontqueri, commonly known as the Fontqueri's four-leafed polycarpon, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces tiny, pale blue flowers in the spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rich, well-drained soils within woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
