                    <h1>Poa coarctata</h1>
<p>Poa coarctata, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Poa coarctata is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountainous habitats.</p>
