                    <h1>Padus serotina</h1>
<p>Padus serotina, commonly known as blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy green. The plant produces white or pale green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit, a small, dark purple drupe, ripens in late summer and is known for its high tartness.</p>
<p>Blackthorn is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, and it plays a role in supporting wildlife, particularly birds that feed on its berries.</p>
