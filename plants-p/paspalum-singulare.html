<p>Paspalum singulare, commonly known as the slender paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Paspalum singulare is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and adaptability to various wetland conditions.</p>
