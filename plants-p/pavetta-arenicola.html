                    <h1>Pavetta arenicola</h1>
<p>Pavetta arenicola, commonly known as the coastal pavetta, is a small shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are pale blue or white, clustered in small umbels, and it produces small, round berries that are edible for some bird species.</p>
<p>Pavetta arenicola plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
