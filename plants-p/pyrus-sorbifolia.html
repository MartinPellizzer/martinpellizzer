                    <h1>Pyrus sorbifolia</h1>
<p>Pyrus sorbifolia, commonly known as the sorb leaf pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that resemble those of the sorbus genus, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits that ripen in late summer. Its botanical features include a woody stem with smooth bark and a preference for well-drained soils in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Pyrus sorbifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
