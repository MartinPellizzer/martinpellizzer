                    <h1>Pycnophyllum aschersonianum</h1>
<p>Pycnophyllum aschersonianum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh environments through its deep root system and ability to store water in its succulent stems. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat.</p>
