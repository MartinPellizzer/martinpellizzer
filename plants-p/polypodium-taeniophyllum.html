<p>Polypodium taeniophyllum, commonly known as the slender wall fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. Its rhizome is wiry and can spread to form extensive colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
