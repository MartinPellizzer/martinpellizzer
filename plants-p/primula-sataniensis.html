<p>Primula sataniensis, commonly known as the devil's lettuce, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reflect excess light.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Primula sataniensis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
