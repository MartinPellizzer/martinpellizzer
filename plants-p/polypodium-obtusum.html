<p>Polypodium obtusum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are typically divided into smaller, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Polypodium obtusum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage.</p>
