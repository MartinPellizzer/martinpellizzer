<p>Polygala mediterranea var. parilica, commonly known as the Mediterranean milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with slender, erect stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers arranged in spicate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with hot, dry summers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight pubescence, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
