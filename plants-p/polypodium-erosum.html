<p>Polypodium erosum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, featuring a distinctive, serrated appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Polypodium erosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
