<p>Prangos scabra, commonly known as the rough prangos, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which help it thrive in arid and high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in the summer months. Prangos scabra is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
