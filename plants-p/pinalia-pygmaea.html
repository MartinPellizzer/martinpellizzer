<p>Pinalia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf pinyon, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Pinaceae family, which includes various pine species, though it is not a true pine. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and scale-like leaves that are arranged in dense clusters. Its cones are small and often remain attached to the plant for years, contributing to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Pinalia pygmaea is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
