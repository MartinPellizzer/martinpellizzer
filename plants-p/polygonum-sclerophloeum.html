                    <h1>Polygonum sclerophloeum</h1>
<p>Polygonum sclerophloeum, commonly known as the hard-shelled knotweed, is a perennial herb native to Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain regions.</p>
