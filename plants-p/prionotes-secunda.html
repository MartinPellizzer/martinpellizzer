                    <h1>Prionotes secunda</h1>
<p>Prionotes secunda, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers, which are arranged in umbels and attract various pollinators. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to many herbivores.</p>
<p>Prionotes secunda plays an important role in supporting native butterfly populations, particularly the monarch butterfly.</p>
