                    <h1>Pontederia cordifolia</h1>
<p>Pontederia cordifolia, commonly known as pickerelweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically green with a prominent midrib. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with violet or blue flowers that bloom from summer to fall. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it both a valuable wetland plant and an invasive species in some regions.</p>
