<p>Podophyllum hexandrum var. emodi, commonly known as Himalayan mayapple, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-like cluster of heart-shaped leaves and its yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous forests at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its medicinal properties, it is also valued in traditional Ayurvedic medicine.</p>
