                    <h1>Phacelia eremica</h1>
<p>Phacelia eremica, commonly known as desert phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, where it has adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small, ovate leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Phacelia eremica is also known for its role in supporting pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers.</p>
