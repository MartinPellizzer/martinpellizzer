                    <h1>Polypodium sagitta</h1>
<p>Polypodium sagitta, commonly known as the arrow fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped fronds that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant thrives in humid environments, often growing on trees or rocks in shaded areas. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique adaptation makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
