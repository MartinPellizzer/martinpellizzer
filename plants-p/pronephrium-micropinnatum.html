<p>Pronephrium micropinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves and small, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its root system is specialized for anchoring in soft substrates and absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Pronephrium micropinnatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
