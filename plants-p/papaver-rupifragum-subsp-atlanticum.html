<p>Papaver rupifragum subsp.</p>
<p>atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic poppy, is a perennial herb native to coastal areas of the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking red flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that help it withstand salty air and strong winds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils along shorelines and cliffs. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
