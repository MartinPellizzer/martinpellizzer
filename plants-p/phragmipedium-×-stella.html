                    <h1>Phragmipedium × stella</h1>
<p>Phragmipedium × stella, commonly known as the Stella orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Phragmipedium kovachii and Phragmipedium sanguinolentum.</p>
<p>It is a sympodial orchid with a pseudobulbous structure, typical of many orchid genera, and produces a single, erect stem bearing a cluster of flowers. The plant's leaves are elongated,革质 (leathery), and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its upright growth habit. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light, and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually pale yellow to orange with a distinctive red or purple lip, making it a visually striking ornamental plant.</p>
