<p>Paederota racemosa, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, green, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. It is a carnivorous plant, supplementing its nutrient intake by trapping and digesting prey.</p>
<p>Its flowers are small and pale yellow, often arranged in a raceme, contributing to its scientific name.</p>
