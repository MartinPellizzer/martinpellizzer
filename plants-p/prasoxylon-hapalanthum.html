                    <h1>Prasoxylon hapalanthum</h1>
<p>Prasoxylon hapalanthum, commonly known as the Socotra cypress, is a unique and ancient tree species native to the Socotra Archipelago.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like crown and twisted, gnarled branches. The plant has a thick, flaky bark that becomes deeply fissured with age, and its leaves are scale-like, arranged in dense clusters. It is adapted to the arid and rugged environment of its native habitat, with a slow growth rate and long lifespan.</p>
<p>The Socotra cypress is considered a living fossil, with its evolutionary lineage dating back millions of years.</p>
