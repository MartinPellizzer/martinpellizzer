<p>Piofontia colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian piofontia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Piofontia colombiana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
