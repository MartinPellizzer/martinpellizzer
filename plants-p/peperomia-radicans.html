The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, followed by bright red berries. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Its trailing growth habit makes it an excellent choice for hanging baskets or as a trailing plant in containers.</p>
