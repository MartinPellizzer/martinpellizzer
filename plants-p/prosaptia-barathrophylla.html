                    <h1>Prosaptia barathrophylla</h1>
<p>Prosaptia barathrophylla, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in the undergrowth of dense forests. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores produced in clusters on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Prosaptia barathrophylla is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
