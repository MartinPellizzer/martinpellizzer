                    <h1>Polypodium dryopteris var. pumilum</h1>
<p>Polypodium dryopteris var. pumilum, commonly known as the small fern or dwarf shield fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, shield-shaped fronds that are typically less than 15 cm in length, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements.</p>
