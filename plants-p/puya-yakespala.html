<p>Puya yakespala, commonly known as the Yakespala torchflower, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and vibrant, spiky inflorescences that resemble torches, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant forms a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid high-altitude environment. Its flowers bloom in late summer and early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Puya yakespala is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
