                    <h1>Pinus sylvestris var. fruticosa</h1>
<p>Pinus sylvestris var. fruticosa, commonly known as the Scots pine shrub form, is a compact variant of the Scots pine, characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit.</p>
<p>It is a dwarf conifer native to northern Europe, typically growing in open, sandy or rocky soils. The plant features short, stiff needles and produces small, purple-blue cones. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is more cold-tolerant than the standard Scots pine, making it suitable for alpine or coastal gardens.</p>
