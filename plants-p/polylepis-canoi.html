<p>Polylepis canoi, commonly known as the Andean wax tree, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, silver-gray foliage and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody, cone-like structures containing seeds. Polylepis canoi plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various Andean wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered vulnerable and faces significant conservation challenges.</p>
