<p>Polygonum planum, commonly known as prostrate knotweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are heart-shaped, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Polygonum planum is known for its ability to thrive in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges.</p>
