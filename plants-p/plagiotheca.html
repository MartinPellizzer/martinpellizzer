                    <h1>Plagiotheca</h1>
<p>Plagiotheca, commonly known as the "butterfly orchid," is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often resemble butterflies in shape and color. They are typically epiphytic, growing on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil. Plagiotheca species are found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral structures and ecological adaptations to their specific habitats.</p>
