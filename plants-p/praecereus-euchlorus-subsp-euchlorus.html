<p>Praecereus euchlorus subsp.</p>
<p>euchlorus, commonly known as the green-flowered cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are usually covered in sparse, pale green or white spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a unique visual contrast to its foliage. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable plant for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in cactus gardens and collections.</p>
