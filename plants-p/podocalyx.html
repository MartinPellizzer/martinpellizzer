                    <h1>Podocalyx</h1>
<p>Podocalyx, commonly known as the silky oaks or silky podocarp, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plants are characterized by their palmate leaves, which are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Podocalyx species typically produce small, yellow or white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>The fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to the plant's reproductive strategy.</p>
