                    <h1>Platylepis glandulosa</h1>
<p>Platylepis glandulosa, commonly known as the smoothleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
