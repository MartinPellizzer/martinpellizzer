<p>Pterocephalus plumosus var. macrochaetus, commonly known as the large-bracted pterocephalus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and large, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its notably larger bracts compared to the typical form of P. plumosus.</p>
