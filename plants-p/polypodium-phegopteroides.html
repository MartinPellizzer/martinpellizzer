                    <h1>Polypodium phegopteroides</h1>
<p>Polypodium phegopteroides, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bi-pinnate fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
