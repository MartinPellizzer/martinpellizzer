                    <h1>Parafestuca</h1>
<p>Parafestuca, commonly known as bluegrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>These grasses are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are characterized by their fine, bluish-green foliage. Many species within the genus are valued for their ornamental appeal and are widely used in landscaping and turfgrass applications. Parafestuca species typically have rhizomatous growth habits, allowing them to form dense, sod-forming mats.</p>
<p>They are also important in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
