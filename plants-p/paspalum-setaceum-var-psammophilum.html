                    <h1>Paspalum setaceum var. psammophilum</h1>
<p>Paspalum setaceum var. psammophilum, commonly known as the sand paspalum, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes, stabilized sand habitats, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soils, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
