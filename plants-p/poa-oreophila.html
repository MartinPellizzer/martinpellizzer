                    <h1>Poa oreophila</h1>
<p>Poa oreophila, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage, which helps it thrive in cool, high-altitude environments. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can withstand harsh climatic conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
<p>Poa oreophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna.</p>
