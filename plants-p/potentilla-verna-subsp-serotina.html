<p>Potentilla verna subsp.</p>
<p>serotina, commonly known as the late flowering cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>The plant features compound leaves with five to seven elliptical leaflets and produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. It blooms later in the season compared to the typical P. verna, usually from June to August.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its delayed flowering and slightly different leaf morphology.</p>
