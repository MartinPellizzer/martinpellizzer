<p>Paspalum siccum, commonly known as the dry panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system.</p>
<p>Paspalum siccum is often found in disturbed areas and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
