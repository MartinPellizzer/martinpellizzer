<p>Paspalidium jubiflorum, commonly known as the purpletop grass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense clusters of purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that helps it conserve water in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Paspalidium jubiflorum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
