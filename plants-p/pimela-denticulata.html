<p>Pimela denticulata, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a aquatic plant native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that resemble the spokes of a wheel. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are typically narrow and serrated, which helps in reducing water resistance.</p>
<p>Pimela denticulata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
