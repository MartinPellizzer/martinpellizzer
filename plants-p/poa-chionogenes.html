<p>Poa chionogenes, commonly known as the snow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Poa chionogenes plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native environment.</p>
