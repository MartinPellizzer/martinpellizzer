<p>Pittosporum mauritianum, commonly known as the African snowball, is a broadleaf evergreen shrub or small tree native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers in spherical clusters, which bloom in spring and are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to various climates.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
