<p>Pachyplectron arifolium, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Pachyplectron arifolium is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
