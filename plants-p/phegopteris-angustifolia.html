<p>Phegopteris angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 10â€“30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>This fern plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
