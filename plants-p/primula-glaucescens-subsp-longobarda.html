<p>Primula glaucescens subsp.</p>
<p>longobarda, commonly known as the Alpine primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features rosettes of lanceolate, glaucous leaves that are covered in a whitish waxy coating, which helps to reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale yellow, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is cultivated in gardens and protected in its natural habitat.</p>
