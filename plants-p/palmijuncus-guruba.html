                    <h1>Palmijuncus guruba</h1>
<p>Palmijuncus guruba, commonly known as the Guruba palm, is a unique species native to the arid regions of northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and a crown of long, narrow leaves that give it a distinct appearance. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access underground water sources. Its flowering occurs in clusters at the base of the leaves, producing small, inconspicuous flowers that eventually develop into clustered fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
