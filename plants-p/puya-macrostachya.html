                    <h1>Puya macrostachya</h1>
<p>Puya macrostachya, commonly known as the giant torch cactus, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean highlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and large, showy inflorescences that resemble torches, typically blooming in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces numerous small, fleshy leaves that form a dense rosette around the base, storing water to adapt to its arid environment. Its flowers are pollinated by insects and birds, contributing to its ecological role in the region.</p>
<p>Puya macrostachya is a long-lived species, with some individuals surviving for over a century.</p>
