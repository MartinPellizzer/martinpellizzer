                    <h1>Potentilla centigrana</h1>
<p>Potentilla centigrana, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing clusters of yellow or white flowers that attract pollinators. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh, alpine environment.</p>
<p>Potentilla centigrana is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
