<p>Pinus sylvestris, commonly known as the Scots pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and needle-like leaves that grow in pairs. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against wildfires and pests.</p>
<p>Pinus sylvestris is often used in reforestation efforts due to its resilience and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
