                    <h1>Potentilla pinnatisecta</h1>
<p>Potentilla pinnatisecta, commonly known as the dissected cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, pinnatisected leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates.</p>
