<p>Pleurostachys stricta var. rabenii, commonly known as the narrowleaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers at the top of the stem, which are followed by blue or purple berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
