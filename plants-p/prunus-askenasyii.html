                    <h1>Prunus askenasyii</h1>
<p>Prunus askenasyii, commonly known as the Askhenazy cherry, is a rare and endangered species native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree with slender, often twisted branches and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by dark red, edible fruits that are similar to cherries. It thrives in mountainous areas with well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist climate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
