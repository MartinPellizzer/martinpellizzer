                    <h1>Plantago ovata var. decumbens</h1>
<p>Plantago ovata var. decumbens, commonly known as dwarf plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. The plant is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its seeds, known as psyllium, are widely used in herbal medicine and as a dietary fiber supplement.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the common plantain (Plantago ovata) but is distinguished by its more compact growth habit.</p>
