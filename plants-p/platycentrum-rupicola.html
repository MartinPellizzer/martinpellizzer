                    <h1>Platycentrum rupicola</h1>
<p>Platycentrum rupicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are often adorned with a delicate, waxy coating. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments, where it forms dense mats. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Platycentrum rupicola is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range.</p>
