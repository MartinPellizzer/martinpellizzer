                    <h1>Paspalum antillense</h1>
<p>Paspalum antillense, commonly known as the Caribbean grass or antillean paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of freshwater bodies, thriving in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Paspalum antillense is sometimes used for erosion control due to its dense root system and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
