<p>Psyllophora davalliana, commonly known as the Davallian scale, is a species of scale insect belonging to the family Psylloidea.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including China, India, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its small, sessile body covered in a waxy coating, which helps protect it from predators and environmental stressors. It typically infests a variety of host plants, including ornamental and fruit trees, causing potential damage through sap feeding.</p>
<p>Due to its cryptic appearance and limited research, it remains a less-studied subject in botanical science.</p>
