<p>Polypodium morlae, commonly known as the Morla's wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant has feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Polypodium morlae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
