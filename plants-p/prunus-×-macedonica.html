                    <h1>Prunus × macedonica</h1>
<p>Prunus × macedonica, commonly known as the Macedonian cherry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Prunus avium (sweet cherry) and Prunus padus (bird cherry).</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3–6 meters. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible cherries that are smaller and more acidic than those of sweet cherry varieties. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
