<p>Panicum benneri, commonly known as silverleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in gardens.</p>
