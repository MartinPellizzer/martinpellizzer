                    <h1>Pinus concolor f. violacea</h1>
<p>Pinus concolor f. violacea, commonly known as the violet pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine characterized by its distinctive violet-tinged foliage.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a unique coloration due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in a striking bluish-violet hue in its needles. The plant retains its foliage year-round, making it visually distinct from typical pine species. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>While it shares the ecological role of its parent species, its ornamental value makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and specialized collections.</p>
