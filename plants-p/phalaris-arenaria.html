                    <h1>Phalaris arenaria</h1>
<p>Phalaris arenaria, commonly known as sand sparrowgrass, is a low-growing annual grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes, riverbanks, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender,丛生 stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize open, disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Phalaris arenaria is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of harsh environmental conditions.</p>
