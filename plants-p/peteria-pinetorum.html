                    <h1>Peteria pinetorum</h1>
<p>Peteria pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest petersia, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale blue, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Peteria pinetorum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
