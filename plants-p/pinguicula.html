                    <h1>Pinguicula</h1>
<p>Pinguicula, commonly known as the butterwort, is a genus of carnivorous plants characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves that trap and digest insect prey.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and rocky habitats. The leaves are broad and often covered in a layer of mucilage, which helps in capturing small insects. Pinguicula species vary in size, with some having small, delicate leaves while others produce larger, more robust ones.</p>
<p>They are native to temperate and tropical regions across the globe, showcasing a wide range of adaptations to their specific ecological niches.</p>
