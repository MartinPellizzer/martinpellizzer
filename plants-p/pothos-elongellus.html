                    <h1>Pothos elongellus</h1>
<p>Pothos elongellus, commonly known as the satin pothos, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically light green with a slight variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is more valued for its ornamental foliage than its blooms. It thrives in indirect light and requires moderate watering to maintain its lush appearance.</p>
<p>Pothos elongellus is often used in hanging baskets or as a trailing plant due to its ability to grow long, flexible stems.</p>
