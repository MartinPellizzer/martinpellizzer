                    <h1>Petasites saxatilis</h1>
<p>Petasites saxatilis, commonly known as the rock edelweiss, is a rare and alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in rocky and high-altitude environments, where it forms a symbiotic relationship with specific fungal species. Its leaves are large and heart-shaped, often covered in a thick layer of fine hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Petasites saxatilis is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
