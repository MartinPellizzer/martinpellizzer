                    <h1>Pteris olivacea</h1>
<p>Pteris olivacea, commonly known as the olive fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous stolons, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
