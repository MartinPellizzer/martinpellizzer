<p>Physoptychis caspica, commonly known as the Caspian bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and specialized structures called bladders, which are used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters, often in regions with soft, muddy substrates. Its reproductive system involves both sexual and asexual methods, allowing it to spread efficiently in suitable environments.</p>
<p>The Caspian bladderwort plays a minor but important role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
