                    <h1>Prunus avium f. mamillaris</h1>
<p>Prunus avium f. mamillaris, commonly known as the dwarf peach, is a compact variant of the peach tree characterized by its smaller size and unique growth habit.</p>
<p>It features a rounded, bushy form with short, upright shoots and a dense canopy, making it ideal for small spaces or container gardening. The leaves are ovate with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy underside, while the flowers are white with a slight pinkish tinge. This form produces small, sweet fruits that are typically less vigorous than those of the standard peach variety.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and as a rootstock in horticulture.</p>
