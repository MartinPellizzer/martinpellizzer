                    <h1>Puccinellia humilis</h1>
<p>Puccinellia humilis, commonly known as the common sea-bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in marshes, estuaries, and salt meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its ability to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Puccinellia humilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
