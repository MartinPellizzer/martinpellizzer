<p>Preonanthus scherfelii f. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered form of the Scherfel's preonanthus, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and its striking yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. This variant is notable for its vibrant coloration, which sets it apart from the typical green-flowered form of the species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
