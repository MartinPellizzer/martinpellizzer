<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds.</p>
<p>Proustia baccharoides plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
