                    <h1>Paspalum multicaule</h1>
<p>Paspalum multicaule, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in dunes or salt marshes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils, it plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems.</p>
