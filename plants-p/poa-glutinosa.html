                    <h1>Poa glutinosa</h1>
<p>Poa glutinosa, commonly known as sticky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often coated with a sticky substance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ability to form dense mats, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
