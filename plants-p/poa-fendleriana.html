                    <h1>Poa fendleriana</h1>
<p>Poa fendleriana, commonly known as the Fendler bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats in rocky or arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to create a lush, carpet-like appearance in dry landscapes.</p>
