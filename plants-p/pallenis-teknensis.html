<p>Pallenis teknensis, commonly known as the Teknensian orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant blooms that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a complex root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and moths, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Pallenis teknensis is now classified as an endangered species.</p>
