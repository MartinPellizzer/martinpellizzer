<p>Pleopeltis annuifrons, commonly known as the annual frond fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has slender, linear leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and its fronds are usually covered with a fine, velvety coating. It produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are essential for its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in humid environments with indirect light and well-draining substrates.</p>
