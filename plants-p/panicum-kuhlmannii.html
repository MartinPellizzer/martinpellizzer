<p>Panicum kuhlmannii, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silvery-gray foliage, which results from its fine, hair-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Silver hairgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing wetland soils.</p>
