                    <h1>Phytolacca esculenta</h1>
<p>Phytolacca esculenta, commonly known as Chinese soapberry, is a perennial shrub native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, thornless stems and alternate leaves that are broadly ovate with a pointed tip. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fleshy, reddish-purple berries that contain toxic seeds. Its roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
<p>However, due to the toxicity of its berries and roots, it should be handled with care.</p>
