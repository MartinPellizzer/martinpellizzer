<p>Polypogon maritimus subsp.</p>
<p>subspathaceus, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
