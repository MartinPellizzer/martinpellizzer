<p>Primula farinosa subsp.</p>
<p>mistassinica, commonly known as the Labrador primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the rocky habitats of eastern Canada and parts of the northeastern United States. It features low-growing, mat-forming stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves covered in a fine, powdery coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
