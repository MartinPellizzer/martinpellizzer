                    <h1>Peristylus tipulifer</h1>
<p>Peristylus tipulifer, commonly known as the slender gall midge, is a species of fly belonging to the family Tipulidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate body and unique larval galls that form on the leaves of certain plants. The plant's botanical significance lies in its role as a host for these galls, which are induced by the larvae of the midge. The galls are typically composed of modified plant tissues, including leaf cells that are hypertrophied and organized into a protective structure.</p>
<p>This interaction between the plant and the insect highlights the complex relationships in ecological systems.</p>
