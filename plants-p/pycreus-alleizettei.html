                    <h1>Pycreus alleizettei</h1>
<p>Pycreus alleizettei, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its pendulous, yellow-orange flowers that resemble small bells, hence its common name. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
