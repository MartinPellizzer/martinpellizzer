                    <h1>Parodia horrida var. heteracantha</h1>
<p>Parodia horrida var. heteracantha, commonly known as the "Cactus of the Desert," is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular stem covered in dense, white to pale blue spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it stores water in its fleshy stem for survival in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and adaptability to harsh environments.</p>
