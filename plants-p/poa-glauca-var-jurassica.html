                    <h1>Poa glauca var. jurassica</h1>
<p>Poa glauca var. jurassica, commonly known as the Jurassic bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, which allows it to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to blue in color, adding to its ornamental value. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
