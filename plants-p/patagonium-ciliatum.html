                    <h1>Patagonium ciliatum</h1>
<p>Patagonium ciliatum, commonly known as the Patagonian feather grass, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and fine, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats or low-growing clumps. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in early spring, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Patagonium ciliatum is adapted to cold, arid conditions and is an important part of the local flora in Patagonia.</p>
