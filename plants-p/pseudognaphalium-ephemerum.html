                    <h1>Pseudognaphalium ephemerum</h1>
<p>Pseudognaphalium ephemerum, commonly known as the ephemeral everlasting flower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow florets arranged in a dense, rounded cluster, which are often mistaken for single flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, displaying a short blooming period, typically during the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>Its common name reflects its brief flowering duration and the appearance of its long-lasting, dried flower heads.</p>
