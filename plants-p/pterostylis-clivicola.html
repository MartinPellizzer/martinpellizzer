<p>Pterostylis clivicola, commonly known as the cliff orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, pale green or brownish flower that resembles a small orchid. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes or cliffs, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs in late autumn to early winter, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
