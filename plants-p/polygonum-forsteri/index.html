<p>Polygonum forsteri is a striking member of the buckwheat family known for its vibrant red and orange flowers that bloom in late summer. This perennial plant is native to the western United States and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its unique coloration makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-resistant and visually appealing plants. Despite its beauty, Polygonum forsteri remains relatively obscure compared to more widely cultivated species.</p>
