<p>Pinus fenzeliana var. dabeshanensis, commonly known as the Dabeshan pine, is a rare coniferous species native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The cones of this variety are small and woody, maturing to release seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in mountainous regions with well-drained soil and a cool, moist climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an important species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
