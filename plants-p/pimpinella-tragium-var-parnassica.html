                    <h1>Pimpinella tragium var. parnassica</h1>
<p>Pimpinella tragium var. parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassian茴香, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and Carpathian Mountains, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments. Its distinctive appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful preservation.</p>
