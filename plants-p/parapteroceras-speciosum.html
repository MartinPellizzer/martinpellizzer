<p>Parapteroceras speciosum, commonly known as the ornate sea hare, is a species of sea slug found in tropical and subtropical marine environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aeolidae and is characterized by its striking, often colorful and intricate shell-like structures. The plant-like appearance of its body is due to the presence of a calcareous, branching skeleton that resembles a coral or algae. This unique morphology aids in camouflage and provides structural support.</p>
<p>Parapteroceras speciosum plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the biodiversity of shallow coastal waters.</p>
