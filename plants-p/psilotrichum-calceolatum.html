                    <h1>Psilotrichum calceolatum</h1>
<p>Psilotrichum calceolatum, commonly known as the small-horned fern, is a rare and delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Psilotaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered fronds that resemble tiny, curled leaves. The plant has a unique reproductive structure, with sporangia arranged in clusters on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rocks or in dense forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
