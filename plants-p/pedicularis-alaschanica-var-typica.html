                    <h1>Pedicularis alaschanica var. typica</h1>
<p>Pedicularis alaschanica var. typica, commonly known as the Alaska lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
