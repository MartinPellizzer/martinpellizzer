                    <h1>Paspalum coromandelinum</h1>
<p>Paspalum coromandelinum, commonly known as the Indian paspalum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is used in some regions for forage or as a stabilizing plant in wetland restoration projects.</p>
