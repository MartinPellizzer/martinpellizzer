                    <h1>Plantago alpina</h1>
<p>Plantago alpina, commonly known as alpine plantain, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions across the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes, which are borne on long, slender stalks. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate cold climates makes it a common sight in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
