<p>Polystichum aculeatum subsp.</p>
<p>lobatum, commonly known as the serrated wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are deeply lobed and toothed, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
