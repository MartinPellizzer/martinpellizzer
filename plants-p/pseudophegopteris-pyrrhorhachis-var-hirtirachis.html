<p>Pseudophegopteris pyrrhorhachis var. hirtirachis, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed cliff fern, is a variant of the red-stemmed cliff fern.</p>
<p>It is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae, characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with hairy stipitate stipes, which distinguish it from its parent species. It thrives in rocky, calcareous environments, often growing on cliffs or rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>This variant is relatively rare and is found in specific regions of Southeast Asia, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
