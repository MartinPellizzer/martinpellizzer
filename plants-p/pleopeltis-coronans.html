<p>Pleopeltis coronans, commonly known as the crowned rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically lanceolate, with a dark green coloration and a distinctive crown-like appearance at the base. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
