                    <h1>Potentilla argentea var. incana</h1>
<p>Potentilla argentea var. incana, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting foliage.</p>
