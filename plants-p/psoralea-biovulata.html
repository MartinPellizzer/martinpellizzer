<p>Psoralea biovulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed psoralea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor and drought-prone soils.</p>
<p>Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind, contributing to its ecological resilience.</p>
