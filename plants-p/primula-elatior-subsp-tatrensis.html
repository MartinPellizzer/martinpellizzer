<p>Primula elatior subsp.</p>
<p>tatrensis, commonly known as the Tatran primrose, is a rare and mountainous plant native to the Tatra Mountains in Central Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with lanceolate to ovate leaves that are typically hairy and dark green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a distinctive purple or brownish throat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often found in meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
