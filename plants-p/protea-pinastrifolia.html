                    <h1>Protea pinastrifolia</h1>
<p>Protea pinastrifolia, commonly known as the silver protea, is a species native to the Western Cape of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, large, and showy inflorescence composed of numerous white to pale pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal fynbos vegetation, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly the sugarbird, which is adapted to feed on its nectar.</p>
<p>The protea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
