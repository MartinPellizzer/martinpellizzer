                    <h1>Platanthera finetiana</h1>
<p>Platanthera finetiana, commonly known as the slender marsh-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist and nutrient-rich soils. Its root system consists of a short rhizome with numerous roots, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
