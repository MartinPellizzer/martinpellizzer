                    <h1>Pterophylla dichotoma</h1>
<p>Pterophylla dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dichotomous branching pattern, where the fronds split into two equal parts at each node. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its delicate, feathery appearance makes it a distinctive addition to botanical collections.</p>
