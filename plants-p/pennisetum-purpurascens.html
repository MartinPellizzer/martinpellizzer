<p>Pennisetum purpurascens, commonly known as purple lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and feathery, purplish-pink plumes that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed.</p>
<p>Pennisetum purpurascens is also valued for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
