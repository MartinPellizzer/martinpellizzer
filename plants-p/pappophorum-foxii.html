<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces lightweight, feathery seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a feature typical of the genus Pappophorum. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
