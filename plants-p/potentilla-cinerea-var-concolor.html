<p>It features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
