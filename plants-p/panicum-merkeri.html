The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear delicate, greenish-brown flowers. Its growth habit is often clump-forming, and it is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
