                    <h1>Polygonum aviculare var. minimum</h1>
<p>Polygonum aviculare var. minimum, commonly known as the dwarf prostrate knotweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, arranged in a prostrate or ascending manner. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, along pathways, and in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
