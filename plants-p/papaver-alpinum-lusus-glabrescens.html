                    <h1>Papaver alpinum lusus glabrescens</h1>
<p>Papaver alpinum lusus glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous alpine poppy, is a rare and striking member of the Papaveraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, often with a distinctive central stigma. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
