                    <h1>Potamogeton clystocarpus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton clystocarpus, commonly known as the small-fruit pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater ecosystems in North America.</p>
<p>It has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically 2â€“8 millimeters wide and arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, dark brown to black seeds that are enclosed in a fleshy, globose fruit, which is a characteristic feature of the genus Potamogeton. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and fish.</p>
<p>Due to its submerged growth habit, it is often difficult to detect unless disturbed.</p>
