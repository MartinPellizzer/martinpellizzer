                <h1>Pachystoma pubescens</h1>
<p>Pachystoma pubescens, commonly known as the hairy stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance and helping to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Pachystoma pubescens is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
