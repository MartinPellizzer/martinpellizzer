                    <h1>Pedicularis eximia</h1>
<p>Pedicularis eximia, commonly known as the noble monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations make it a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticulture.</p>
