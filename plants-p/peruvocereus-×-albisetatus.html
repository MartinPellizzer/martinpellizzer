<p>Peruvocereus × albisetatus, commonly known as the white-flowered night bloomer, is a hybrid cactus species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and clusters of large, white flowers that open at night. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers emit a subtle fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with full sun exposure.</p>
