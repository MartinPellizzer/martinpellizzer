                    <h1>Pollinia fragilis</h1>
<p>Pollinia fragilis, commonly known as the fragile pollinia orchid, is a unique plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its specialized reproductive structures called pollinia, which are sticky masses of pollen. These pollinia are easily dislodged, facilitating the plant's pollination by various insect vectors. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role in ecological pollination systems and its distinctive morphological features.</p>
