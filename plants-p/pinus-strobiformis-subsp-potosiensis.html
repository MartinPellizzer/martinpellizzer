<p>Pinus strobiformis subsp.</p>
<p>potosiensis, commonly known as the Potosí pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of northern Mexico. This subspecies is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and dense, dark green needles that are typically arranged in fascicles of five.</p>
<p>It produces cones that are typically 8–12 cm long, with thick, persistent bracts that give the cones a distinctive appearance. The tree is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils and experiencing cold, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
