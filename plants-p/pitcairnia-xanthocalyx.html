                    <h1>Pitcairnia xanthocalyx</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia xanthocalyx, commonly known as the golden pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in a spike, adding a dramatic visual element to its appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
