                    <h1>Pilocarpus manuensis</h1>
<p>Pilocarpus manuensis, commonly known as the Amazonian jambul, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces berries that turn from green to red as they mature, containing a single seed. It is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its use in treating eye conditions due to its stimulant effects on the sympathetic nervous system.</p>
<p>However, it is also toxic in large quantities, making it a plant of both interest and caution.</p>
