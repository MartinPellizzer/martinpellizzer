<p>Pilularia americana, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant has tiny, thread-like leaves and produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface. It is an obligate aquatic plant, meaning it cannot survive out of water.</p>
<p>Pilularia americana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
