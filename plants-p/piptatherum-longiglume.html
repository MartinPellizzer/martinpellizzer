<p>Piptatherum longiglume, commonly known as the long-glume grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, making it a common component of grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Piptatherum longiglume is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
