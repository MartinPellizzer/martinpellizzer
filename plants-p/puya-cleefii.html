<p>It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-shaped structure and ability to store water in its fleshy stems. The plant produces tall, spiky inflorescences that bear showy, violet or purple flowers, which bloom briefly during the dry season. Its leaves are thick and covered in a waxy cuticle, helping to reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
