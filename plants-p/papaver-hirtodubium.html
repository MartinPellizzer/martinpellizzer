<p>Papaver hirtodubium, commonly known as the rough-tomentose poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces striking, bright red flowers with prominent yellow stamens, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
