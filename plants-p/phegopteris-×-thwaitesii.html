<p>Phegopteris × thwaitesii, commonly known as the hybrid cinnamon fern, is a deciduous fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid between Phegopteris connectiva and Phegopteris hexandra, resulting in unique morphological characteristics. The plant features a tall, slender, sterile frond that resembles a cinnamon stick, hence its common name. Its fertile fronds are clustered at the base and produce spores in early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
