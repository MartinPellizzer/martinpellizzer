<p>Phymatopteris ebenipes, commonly known as the Florida shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
