                    <h1>Platycerium stemaria</h1>
<p>Platycerium stemaria, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Australia and New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds that grow directly from the central stem, giving it a striking, tree-like appearance. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its fronds from the air and rain. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are typically found on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Platycerium stemaria thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often seen growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat.</p>
