                            <h1>Panicum Cernuum</h1>
<p>Panicum cernuum, commonly known as hanging panicgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its distinctive feature is its drooping, feathery seed heads that sway gracefully in the breeze. This plant plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining ecological balance. Its simple yet elegant appearance makes it a valuable addition to native plant gardens.</p>
