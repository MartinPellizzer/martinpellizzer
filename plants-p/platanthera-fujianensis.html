<p>Platanthera fujianensis, commonly known as the Fujian lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a dense cluster of pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in mountainous regions. Its flowers emit a faint fragrance, which helps attract pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
