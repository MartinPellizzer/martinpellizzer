                    <h1>Pogonia metallina</h1>
<p>Pogonia metallina, commonly known as the coppery pogonia, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, metallic-green to copper-colored petals and sepals, which are adorned with intricate patterns of purple and white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as bogs and swamps, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the species is known for its specialized pollination mechanism involving specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pogonia metallina is considered endangered in many of its range areas.</p>
