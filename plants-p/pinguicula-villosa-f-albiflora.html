                    <h1>Pinguicula villosa f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Pinguicula villosa f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered cushion liverwort, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Pinguiculaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, moss-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant's leaves are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, which aids in capturing moisture and small prey. Its flowers, which are pale white to cream in color, are usually small and clustered, contributing to its unique aesthetic.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
