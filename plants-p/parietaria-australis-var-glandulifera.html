                    <h1>Parietaria australis var. glandulifera</h1>
<p>Parietaria australis var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular parietaria, is a flowering plant native to southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves with prominent glandular hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The glandular structures on its leaves and stems are thought to produce a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
