<p>Potamogeton × vepsicus, commonly known as the hybrid water plantain, is a submerged aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Potamogeton acutifolius and Potamogeton natans, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Potamogeton × vepsicus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish.</p>
