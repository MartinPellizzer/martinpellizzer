                    <h1>Picea integrisquamis</h1>
<p>Picea integrisquamis, commonly known as the white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its distinctive white-tinged bark, which becomes flaky with age. The tree's needles are short, flat, and dark green, often with two white stomatal lines on their upper surface. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Picea integrisquamis thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in boreal forests and mountainous regions.</p>
