                    <h1>Polypodium vulpinum</h1>
<p>Polypodium vulpinum, commonly known as the fox's tail fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, dense, and upright frond structure that resembles a fox's tail, with numerous small, finger-like pinnae. The plant prefers moist, acidic soil and partial to full shade, making it well-suited for woodland gardens. It is relatively low maintenance and can tolerate occasional drought once established.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its lush, green foliage and its ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
