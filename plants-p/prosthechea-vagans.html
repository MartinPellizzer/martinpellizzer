<p>Prosthechea vagans, commonly known as the wandering prosthechea, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces long, pendulous inflorescences bearing numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in fine, hairy structures that aid in moisture retention.</p>
<p>Prosthechea vagans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
