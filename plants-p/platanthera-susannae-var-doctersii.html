                    <h1>Platanthera susannae var. doctersii</h1>
<p>Platanthera susannae var. doctersii, commonly known as the Docters' lady's-ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to white flowers with a distinctive yellow-green lip, which is a key feature in its botanical identification. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and cypress swamps, often in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. It has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
