                    <h1>Polypodium vulgare var. hibernicum</h1>
<p>Polypodium vulgare var. hibernicum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are typically bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, lance-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia clustered in sori.</p>
<p>This variety is often distinguished from the nominate form by its slightly more robust fronds and broader distribution across colder climates.</p>
