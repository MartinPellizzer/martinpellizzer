                    <h1>Phoradendron longifolium</h1>
<p>Phoradendron longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along its stems. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in small umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The species is part of the Viscaceae family and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of forest ecosystems.</p>
