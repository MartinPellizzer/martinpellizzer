                    <h1>Phebalium tuberculosum</h1>
<p>Phebalium tuberculosum, commonly known as the woolly phebalium, is a shrub native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It features dense, glandular hairs that give its foliage a woolly appearance, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding insects. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to the dry climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Phebalium tuberculosum is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
