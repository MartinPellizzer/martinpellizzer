                    <h1>Polystichum acrostichoides f. ligulatum</h1>
<p>Polystichum acrostichoides f. ligulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a variant of the common holly fern.</p>
<p>It is a perennial evergreen fern native to the eastern United States, particularly in wet, shaded environments. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically narrower than those of the typical form. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, woodland conditions.</p>
