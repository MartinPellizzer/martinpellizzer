                    <h1>Poa salina</h1>
<p>Poa salina, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to tolerate high salt concentrations. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomes help stabilize soils in salty, coastal areas, making it an important pioneer species in such habitats.</p>
<p>Poa salina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in harsh, saline conditions.</p>
