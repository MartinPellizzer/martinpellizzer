                    <h1>Polypodium schenkii</h1>
<p>Polypodium schenkii, commonly known as the Schenk's fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it attaches to rocks or tree trunks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Polypodium schenkii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
