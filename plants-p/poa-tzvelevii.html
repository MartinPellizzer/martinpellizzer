<p>Poa tzvelevii, commonly known as Tzvelev's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Poa tzvelevii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
