                    <h1>Platanthera kuenkelei</h1>
<p>Platanthera kuenkelei, commonly known as the Kuenkele's twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in a spike. It is notable for its lack of showy petals and its reliance on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
