<p>Puccinellia leiolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saltbush, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often blue-green stems and narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in saline soils and is often found in coastal dunes, salt marshes, and other saline habitats. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Puccinellia leiolepis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native range.</p>
