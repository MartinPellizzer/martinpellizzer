<p>Picea mariana f. semiprostrata, commonly known as the creeping black spruce, is a low-growing variant of the black spruce native to northern North America.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a prostrate growth habit, with sprawling branches that often form dense mats on the ground. Its foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are dark green and densely packed, providing effective wind protection. The cones are typically small and conical, maturing to release seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal forests and peatlands.</p>
