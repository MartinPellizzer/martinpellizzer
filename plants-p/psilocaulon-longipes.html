                    <h1>Psilocaulon longipes</h1>
<p>Psilocaulon longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed coralroot, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in a raceme, typical of the Orchidaceae family. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which provide the necessary nutrients for its survival.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Psilocaulon longipes is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
