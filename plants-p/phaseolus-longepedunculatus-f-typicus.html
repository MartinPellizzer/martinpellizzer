<p>Phaseolus longepedunculatus f. typicus, commonly known as the long peduncled bean, is a botanical variant of the genus Phaseolus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated peduncles, which are the stalks that support the inflorescences. The plant typically produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods.

<p>This species is native to Central and South America and is often cultivated for its edible seeds, though it is less commonly grown than other bean varieties.</p>
