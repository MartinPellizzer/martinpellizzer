<p>Proiphys, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant's unique morphology includes a short, woody stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating. Proiphys thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in shaded, rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in its native habitat.</p>
