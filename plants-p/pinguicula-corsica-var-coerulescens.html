                    <h1>Pinguicula corsica var. coerulescens</h1>
<p>Pinguicula corsica var. coerulescens, commonly known as the Corsican butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces delicate, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous habits make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
