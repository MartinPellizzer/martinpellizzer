                    <h1>Poa irrigata f. aucta</h1>
<p>Poa irrigata f. aucta, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada meadow grass, is a variant of the common meadow grass found in high-elevation environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry blades that often form dense mats on rocky soils. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to bluish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained habitats such as meadows and stream banks in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
