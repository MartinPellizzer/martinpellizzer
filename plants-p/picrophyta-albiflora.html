                    <h1>Picrophyta albiflora</h1>
<p>Picrophyta albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to cling to tree bark. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity and moderate temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Picrophyta albiflora is considered endangered and is often found in protected natural reserves.</p>
