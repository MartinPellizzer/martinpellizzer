<p>Phoradendron minutifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together, followed by red, fleshy berries that serve as a food source for birds and other animals. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the berries, facilitating its spread to new host trees.</p>
<p>The plant's parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
