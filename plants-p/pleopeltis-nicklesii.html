<p>Pleopeltis nicklesii, commonly known as the Nickles' tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, with the trunk forming a woody structure that supports the fronds. Its reproductive structures are hidden within the leaf axils, and it produces spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in humid, shaded environments, typically in forest understories.</p>
