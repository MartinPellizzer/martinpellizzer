                    <h1>Picea abies f. tabuliformis</h1>
<p>Picea abies f. tabuliformis, commonly known as the Norwegian spruce, is a variant of the Norway spruce characterized by its distinctive flattened, table-like shoots.</p>
<p>This unique growth habit results in a dense, conical shape that distinguishes it from typical spruce forms. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves, which are typically dark green and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stems. It is a deciduous conifer, shedding its needles in the fall, and produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
