<p>Pachypodium geayi, commonly known as the Madagascar bottle tree, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, columnar stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers during the dry season, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are typically small and clustered at the base, reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Pachypodium geayi is well adapted to drought and can thrive in full sun with minimal water.</p>
