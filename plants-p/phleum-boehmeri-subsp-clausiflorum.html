<p>Phleum boehmeri subsp.</p>
<p>clausiflorum, commonly known as the closed-flower bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with tightly closed flowers, which open only briefly during pollination. Its leaves are typically bluish-green and have a distinctive hairy texture.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks, where it contributes to soil stabilization and biodiversity.</p>
