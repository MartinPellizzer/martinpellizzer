<p>Poecilopteris ludens, commonly known as the ornate cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often adorned with intricate patterns and a slightly serrated edge. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on rocky slopes or cliffs where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The ornate cliff fern is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
