                    <h1>Parasenegalia amorimii</h1>
<p>Parasenegalia amorimii, commonly known as the Amazonian parasenegal, is a rare shrub native to the rainforests of northern South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming during the rainy season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Parasenegalia amorimii is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
