<p>Parsonsia reticulata, commonly known as the reticulate flame vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Australia and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling flames. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are dark green and glossy. It is a climbing shrub that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, using its tendrils to support itself.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure and bright coloration.</p>
