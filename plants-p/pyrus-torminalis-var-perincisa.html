                    <h1>Pyrus torminalis var. perincisa</h1>
<p>Pyrus torminalis var. perincisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pear, is a variant of the common pear tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and smaller, less showy flowers compared to the typical pear species. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are typically not suitable for consumption but are of interest in botanical studies. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its distinct morphology and its role in understanding the genetic variation within the Pyrus genus.</p>
