                    <h1>Pancovia mortehanii</h1>
<p>Pancovia mortehanii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns resembling ghostly apparitions. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pancovia mortehanii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
