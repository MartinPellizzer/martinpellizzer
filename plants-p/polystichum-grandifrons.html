                    <h1>Polystichum grandifrons</h1>
<p>Polystichum grandifrons, commonly known as the giant fern or the broad-leaf wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients effectively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium.</p>
