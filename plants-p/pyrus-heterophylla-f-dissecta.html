                    <h1>Pyrus heterophylla f. dissecta</h1>
<p>Pyrus heterophylla f. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected pear, is a unique horticultural form of the pear tree characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves.</p>
<p>This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value, particularly in gardens where its delicate foliage creates a striking visual effect. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1â€“3 meters. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a specimen plant.</p>
<p>While it produces small, edible fruits, its primary appeal lies in its distinctive leaf structure and seasonal color changes.</p>
