                    <h1>Pterolepis litoralis</h1>
<p>Pterolepis litoralis, commonly known as the coastal pterolepis, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the late spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid coastal environment.</p>
<p>Pterolepis litoralis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
