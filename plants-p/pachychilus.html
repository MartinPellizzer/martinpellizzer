                    <h1>Pachychilus</h1>
<p>Pachychilus, commonly known as the "tongue fern," is a genus of ferns native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often spirally arranged fronds that resemble the shape of a tongue. Pachychilus species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, thriving on trees or rocks in humid environments. Their rhizomes are usually short and thick, contributing to their ability to absorb moisture and nutrients from their surroundings.</p>
<p>The genus includes around 30 species, many of which are prized for their ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
