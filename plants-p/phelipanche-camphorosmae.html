                    <h1>Phelipanche camphorosmae</h1>
<p>Phelipanche camphorosmae, commonly known as the camphor weed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is a root-parasitic species that lacks chlorophyll. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its flowers are small, pale purple to white, and are arranged in clusters, while its roots produce a distinctive camphor-like scent.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops by draining nutrients from host plants.</p>
