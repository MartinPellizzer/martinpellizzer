                    <h1>Potentilla rupestris var. pygmaea</h1>
<p>Potentilla rupestris var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to rocky and alpine environments in western North America.</p>
<p>It features small, palmately lobed leaves that are typically hairy and adapted to withstand harsh, arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats.</p>
