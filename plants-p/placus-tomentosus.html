                    <h1>Placus tomentosus</h1>
<p>Placus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to moist, nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves that help trap insects, which it then digests to obtain nutrients. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, and its roots are often submerged. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually green or yellowish in color.</p>
<p>Placus tomentosus plays a unique role in its ecosystem by supplementing its nutrient intake through predation.</p>
