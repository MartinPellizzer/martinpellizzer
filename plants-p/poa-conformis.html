                    <h1>Poa conformis</h1>
<p>Poa conformis, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its dense growth, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover.</p>
