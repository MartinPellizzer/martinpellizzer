<p>Polylepis besseri subsp.</p>
<p>subtusalbida, commonly known as the white-flowered polylepis, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters and are adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, making it a long-lived species in its environment. Its leaves are typically small and densely packed, helping to reduce water loss in the harsh climate.</p>
