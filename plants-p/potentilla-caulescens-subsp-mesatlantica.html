                    <h1>Potentilla caulescens subsp. mesatlantica</h1>
<p>Potentilla caulescens subsp.</p>
<p>mesatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic coast. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or on rocky coastal cliffs.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in coastal gardens.</p>
