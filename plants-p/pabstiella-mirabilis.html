                    <h1>Pabstiella mirabilis</h1>
<p>Pabstiella mirabilis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, leafless stems and delicate, white flowers that resemble ghosts, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and filtered sunlight, to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Pabstiella mirabilis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
