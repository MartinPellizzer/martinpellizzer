<p>Puccinellia pseudodistans, commonly known as the narrowleaf saltbush, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant has fibrous roots that help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Puccinellia pseudodistans is often found in salt marshes, dunes, and other saline habitats where it plays a role in preventing erosion and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
