<p>Pierardia seemannii, commonly known as the desert buttercup, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It is adapted to survive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
