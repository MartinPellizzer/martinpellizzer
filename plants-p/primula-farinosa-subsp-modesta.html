<p>Primula farinosa subsp.</p>
<p>modesta, commonly known as the modest primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically features hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are densely covered with a fine, flour-like coating, giving it its scientific name "farinosa," which means "starch-like.".</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>
