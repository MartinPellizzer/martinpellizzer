<p>Potentilla ornithopodioides, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes.</p>
