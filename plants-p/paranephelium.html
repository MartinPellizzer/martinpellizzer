                    <h1>Paranephelium</h1>
<p>Paranephelium, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a genus of ferns native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble clouds, hence its common name. The plants typically grow in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Paranephelium species have rhizomatous growth habits and produce small, spore-bearing sporangia on the undersides of their leaves.</p>
<p>These ferns are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
