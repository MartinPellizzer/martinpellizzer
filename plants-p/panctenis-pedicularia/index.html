                            <h1>Panctenis Pedicularia</h1>
<p>Common dog's-ear, scientifically known as Panctenis pedicularia, is a small flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is named for its distinctive, ear-shaped leaves that resemble the ears of a dog. This plant thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in open fields. Its delicate pink or white flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Despite its modest appearance, the Common dog's-ear plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems.</p>
