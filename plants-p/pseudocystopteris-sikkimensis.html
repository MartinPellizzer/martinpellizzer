                    <h1>Pseudocystopteris sikkimensis</h1>
<p>Pseudocystopteris sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim shield fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its unique, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a complex arrangement of pinnae and pinnules, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
