                    <h1>Phoradendron flavomarginatum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron flavomarginatum, commonly known as the yellow-margin mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the tropics.</p>
<p>It has woody stems and produces small, green leaves that are often covered with a waxy coating. The plant produces white or yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics reflect adaptations to a parasitic lifestyle while maintaining some photosynthetic capabilities.</p>
