<p>Polypodium cameroonianum, commonly known as the Cameroon fern, is a species of polypody found in tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and produces fronds that are pinnately divided with a distinctive, glossy appearance. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Polypodium cameroonianum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
