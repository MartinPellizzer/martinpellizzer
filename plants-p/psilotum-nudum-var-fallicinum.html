                    <h1>Psilotum nudum var. fallicinum</h1>
<p>Psilotum nudum var. fallicinum, commonly known as the slender whisk fern, is a small, primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often mistaken for roots. The plant lacks true leaves, stems, and roots, and instead has specialized structures called rhizomes and sporangia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period, and is considered a living fossil.</p>
