                    <h1>Pyrus heseltinei</h1>
<p>Pyrus heseltinei, commonly known as the Heseltine pear, is a rare and critically endangered species native to China.</p>
<p>It is a small deciduous tree with smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible pears that are typically small and sweet.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is highly susceptible to extinction and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
