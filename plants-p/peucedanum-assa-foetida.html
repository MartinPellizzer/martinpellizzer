<p>Peucedanum assa-foetida, commonly known as the devil's dung or stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, often pungent compounds. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has hollow, ridged stems that are often used in traditional medicine. Its fruits are dry, schizocarpic structures that split into two one-seeded parts when mature.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is primarily due to the presence of volatile oils and sulfur-containing compounds.</p>
