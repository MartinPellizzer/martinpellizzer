                    <h1>Poa piifontii</h1>
<p>Poa piifontii, commonly known as the Pifonti bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it thrive in cold, mountainous environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing some protection against harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>Poa piifontii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens for its resilience and aesthetic qualities.</p>
