<p>Polypodium leptophyllum, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the trunks of trees or on rocky surfaces in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizome that sends out stolons, which produce new fronds. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with slender, linear pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor conditions, making it a characteristic component of forest understories.</p>
