                    <h1>Potentilla amansiana</h1>
<p>Potentilla amansiana, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Potentilla amansiana is adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes.</p>
