                    <h1>Pachycarpus spurius</h1>
<p>Pachycarpus spurius, commonly known as the spiny pachycarpus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, a typical adaptation to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny exterior. Its roots are shallow and widespread, allowing it to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes.</p>
