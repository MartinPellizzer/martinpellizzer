<p>Phymatopteris ebenipes var. oakesii, commonly known as the Oakes' shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, humus-filled soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
