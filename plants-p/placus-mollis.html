                    <h1>Placus mollis</h1>
<p>Placus mollis, commonly known as the soft cushion plant, is a low-growing succulent native to arid regions.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, overlapping leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure, helping it retain moisture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of yellow or green, typically during the spring or early summer. Its leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating that aids in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Placus mollis is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
