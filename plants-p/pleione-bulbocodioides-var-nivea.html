                    <h1>Pleione bulbocodioides var. nivea</h1>
<p>Pleione bulbocodioides var. nivea, commonly known as the snow pleione, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the high-altitude forests of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive, almost translucent appearance. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its cool, moist mountain habitat. Its leaves are typically dark green and strap-shaped, emerging from the base of the pseudobulbs.</p>
<p>This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its beauty and rarity, though it is challenging to cultivate outside its natural environment.</p>
