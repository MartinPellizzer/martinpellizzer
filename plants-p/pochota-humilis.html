<p>Pochota humilis, commonly known as the Mexican coffee bean, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America and northern South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes other coffee species, and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature, containing one or two seeds. These seeds are used to make a traditional coffee beverage, though they are not as widely cultivated as other coffee species.</p>
<p>Pochota humilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes grown in gardens for its foliage and floral display.</p>
