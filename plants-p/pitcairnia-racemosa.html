                    <h1>Pitcairnia racemosa</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia racemosa, commonly known as the clustered pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of long, pointed, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with numerous small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens.</p>
