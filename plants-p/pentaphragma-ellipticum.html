                    <h1>Pentaphragma ellipticum</h1>
<p>Pentaphragma ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptic bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its submerged, leaf-like structures that are often mistaken for leaves but are actually specialized for gas exchange. The plant produces tiny, bladder-like structures called pneumatocysts, which help it float and access oxygen-rich water. It is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and unique adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
