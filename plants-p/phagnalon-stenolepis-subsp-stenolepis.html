<p>Phagnalon stenolepis subsp.</p>
<p>stenolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved phagnalon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands.</p>
<p>The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves and produces small, pink to purple flowers in the summer months. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and drought tolerance.</p>
