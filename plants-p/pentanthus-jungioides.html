                    <h1>Pentanthus jungioides</h1>
<p>Pentanthus jungioides, commonly known as the jungle orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating to retain moisture in humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Pentanthus jungioides is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
