                    <h1>Panicum minutum</h1>
<p>Panicum minutum, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a small annual grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of less than 10 inches and has fine, hair-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its low profile and rapid growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
