                    <h1>Phalangium zeyheri</h1>
<p>Phalangium zeyheri, commonly known as the Zeyher's scorpion plant, is a unique member of the Asparagaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its peculiar, scorpion-like appearance due to its elongated, segmented leaves. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise spiky form. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Despite its intimidating look, it is a relatively low-maintenance plant that can be a striking addition to succulent gardens.</p>
