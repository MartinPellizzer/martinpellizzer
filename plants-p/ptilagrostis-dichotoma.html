                    <h1>Ptilagrostis dichotoma</h1>
<p>Ptilagrostis dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often branch dichotomously, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Ptilagrostis dichotoma is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
