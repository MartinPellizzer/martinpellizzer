<p>Pseudevax mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritanian false acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and provide habitat for local wildlife.</p>
