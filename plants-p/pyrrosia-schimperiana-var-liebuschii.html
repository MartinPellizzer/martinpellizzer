<p>Pyrrosia schimperiana var. liebuschii, commonly known as the Liebusch's rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions in East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The fronds are typically short and broad, with a leathery texture and a dark green coloration. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found growing on rock surfaces or in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
