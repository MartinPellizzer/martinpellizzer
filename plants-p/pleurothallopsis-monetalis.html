                    <h1>Pleurothallopsis monetalis</h1>
<p>Pleurothallopsis monetalis, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that resemble small stars, which bloom during the wet season. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its humid, shaded environment. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, adapted to maximize light absorption in the dense forest understory.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
