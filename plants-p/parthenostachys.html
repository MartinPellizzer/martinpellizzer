                    <h1>Parthenostachys</h1>
<p>Parthenostachys, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, strap-like leaves and its striking, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Parthenostachys has a short flowering period and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its rarity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
