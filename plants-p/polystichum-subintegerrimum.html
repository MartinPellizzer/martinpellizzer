<p>Polystichum subintegerrimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies over time.</p>
