                    <h1>Platythelys debilis</h1>
<p>Platythelys debilis, commonly known as the weakly clustered moss, is a small, terrestrial moss species belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, prostrate growth habit and pale green to yellowish-green foliage. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a gradually narrowed base and a sharp apex, and they often exhibit a distinctive, undulating margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocks or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is often overlooked but plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for small invertebrates.</p>
