<p>Pilosocereus oreus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems and the ability to store water in its thick, fleshy tissue. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water.</p>
<p>The plant's unique adaptations allow it to survive in harsh desert environments.</p>
