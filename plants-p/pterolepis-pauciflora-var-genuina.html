                    <h1>Pterolepis pauciflora var. genuina</h1>
<p>Pterolepis pauciflora var. genuina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pterolepis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the early summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
