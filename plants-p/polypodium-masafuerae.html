<p>Polypodium masafuerae, commonly known as the Masafuera huperzia, is a rare fern species native to the island of Masafuera in the Gal√°pagos archipelago.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are dark green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polypodium masafuerae is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native ecosystem.</p>
