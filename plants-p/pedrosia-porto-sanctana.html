<p>Pedrosia porto-sanctana, commonly known as the Porto Santo lichen, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Pertusariaceae.</p>
<p>It is a crustose lichen, typically forming a thin, tightly adhering layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is usually pale yellow to orange in color, and it often grows in humid, shaded environments. It is found primarily on the island of Porto Santo in the Azores, where it thrives on calcareous substrates.</p>
<p>This lichen is of particular interest due to its restricted distribution and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
