                    <h1>Pachygenium albicans</h1>
<p>Pachygenium albicans, commonly known as the white-stemmed bladdergrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Pachygenium albicans is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
