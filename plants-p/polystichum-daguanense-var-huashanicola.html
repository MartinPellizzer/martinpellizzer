<p>Polystichum daguanense var. huashanicola, commonly known as the Huashan wood fern, is a variant of the Daguan wood fern native to China.</p>
<p>It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its feathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, humusy soil. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
