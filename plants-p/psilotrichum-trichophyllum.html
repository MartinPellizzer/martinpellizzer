<p>Psilotrichum trichophyllum, commonly known as the hairy clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its diminutive, clustered stems and small, scale-like leaves that give it a dense, moss-like appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Psilotrichum trichophyllum is a primitive vascular plant with a simple structure, reflecting its ancient evolutionary origins.</p>
