                    <h1>Poa radicans</h1>
<p>Poa radicans, commonly known as the creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It has a mat-forming growth habit, with rhizomes and stolons that allow it to spread rapidly across the ground. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Poa radicans is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides due to its adaptability and resilience.</p>
<p>Its ability to form dense turf makes it a common choice for turfgrass in cooler climates.</p>
