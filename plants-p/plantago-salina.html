<p>Plantago salina, commonly known as sea plantain, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in spikes, typically blooming in the spring.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions makes it an important species in stabilizing dune ecosystems.</p>
