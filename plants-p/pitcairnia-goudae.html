<p>Pitcairnia goudae, commonly known as the Gouda pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>

Its unique morphology and striking appearance make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservatories.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia goudae is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
