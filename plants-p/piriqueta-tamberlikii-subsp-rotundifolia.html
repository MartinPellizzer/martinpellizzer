<p>Piriqueta tamberlikii subsp.</p>
<p>rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf piriqueta, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive round, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
