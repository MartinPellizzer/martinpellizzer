                    <h1>Parastrephia lepidophylla</h1>
<p>Parastrephia lepidophylla, commonly known as the fairy fan or desert fan, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, spiky leaves that form a compact, fan-like structure. The plant is known for its ability to survive extreme drought conditions by entering a state of dormancy. When water becomes available, it rapidly expands and blooms with striking, pinkish-white flowers.</p>
<p>This species is also notable for its unusual ability to curl up and appear dead when dry, only to revive when conditions improve.</p>
