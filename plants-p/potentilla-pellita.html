                    <h1>Potentilla pellita</h1>
<p>Potentilla pellita, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid, high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Potentilla pellita is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun and cool temperatures.</p>
