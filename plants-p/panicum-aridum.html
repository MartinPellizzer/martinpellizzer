                    <h1>Panicum aridum</h1>
<p>Panicum aridum, commonly known as desert grass or sand grass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-bearing flowers, typically in late spring or early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in dry landscapes.</p>
