                    <h1>Polypodium lanosum</h1>
<p>Polypodium lanosum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
