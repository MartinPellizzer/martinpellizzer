                    <h1>Phoradendron aphyllum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron aphyllum, commonly known as the leafless mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its stem and roots, which are embedded in the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or pale flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its lack of leaves makes it unique among mistletoes, as it relies entirely on its host for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This parasitic relationship can significantly impact the health of the host tree over time.</p>
