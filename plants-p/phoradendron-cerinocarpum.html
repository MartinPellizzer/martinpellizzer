                    <h1>Phoradendron cerinocarpum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron cerinocarpum, commonly known as the white-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host trees for water and nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. It is native to parts of Central and South America, where it commonly grows on trees such as mahogany and ceiba.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature and unique ecological role make it an important component of forest ecosystems.</p>
