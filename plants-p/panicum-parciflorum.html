<p>Panicum parciflorum, commonly known as the sparse-flower grass, is a species of grass native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations.</p>
<p>Panicum parciflorum plays a minor ecological role in its native environment, providing minimal forage for wildlife.</p>
