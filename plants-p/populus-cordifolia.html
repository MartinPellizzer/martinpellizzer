<p>Populus cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 5â€“10 cm in length and have a smooth, waxy surface. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common feature among poplar species. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Populus cordifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forested areas.</p>
