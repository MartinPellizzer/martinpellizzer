<p>Perakalia perakensis, commonly known as the Bornean ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and striking, pale purple flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in the humid, shaded understory of tropical forests, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Perakalia perakensis is considered critically endangered.</p>
