                    <h1>Paronychia sessilis</h1>
<p>Paronychia sessilis, commonly known as the sessile leaf speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Paronychia sessilis thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
