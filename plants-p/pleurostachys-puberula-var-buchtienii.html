<p>Pleurostachys puberula var. buchtienii, commonly known as the Buchtienii false yew, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Taxaceae family, which includes true yews, and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and conifer-like appearance. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and requires careful conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
