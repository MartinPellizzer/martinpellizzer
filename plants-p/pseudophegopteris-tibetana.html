                    <h1>Pseudophegopteris tibetana</h1>
<p>Pseudophegopteris tibetana, commonly known as the Tibetan water fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that adapt to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant thrives in cold, freshwater habitats such as lakes and streams at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of its fronds, facilitating spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable indicator species for high-altitude biodiversity.</p>
