                    <h1>Panax bakerianus</h1>
<p>Panax bakerianus, commonly known as the Baker's ginseng, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by red berries that contain the seeds. Its root system is complex and resembles that of other ginseng species, making it valuable in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
