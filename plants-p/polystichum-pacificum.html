<p>Polystichum pacificum, commonly known as the Pacific shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium.</p>
