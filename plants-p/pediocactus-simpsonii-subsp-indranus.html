<p>Pediocactus simpsonii subsp.</p>
<p>indranus, commonly known as the Simpson's barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are clustered at the top of the stem. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and susceptibility to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
