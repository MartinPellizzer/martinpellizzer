                    <h1>Pedicularis</h1>
<p>Pedicularis, commonly known as the lobster orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique, often vibrant and showy flowers that resemble small orchids. They are typically found in alpine and arctic regions, thriving in cool, moist environments. Pedicularis species are hemiparasitic, meaning they derive some nutrients from their host plants while also performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Their flowers often have a spurred shape, which is adapted for pollination by specific insect species.</p>
