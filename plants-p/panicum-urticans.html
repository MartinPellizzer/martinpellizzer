                    <h1>Panicum urticans</h1>
<p>Panicum urticans, commonly known as the stinging panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, bristly foliage that can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats.</p>
