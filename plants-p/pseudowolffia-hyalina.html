<p>Pseudowolffia hyalina, commonly known as the glassy water moss, is a microscopic aquatic plant belonging to the family Zygnemataceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, ribbon-like leaves that float on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant lacks true roots and stems, and its structure is composed of filamentous cells that form a dense mat. It reproduces through the production of motile zoospores, which are released into the water.</p>
<p>Pseudowolffia hyalina plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the biological diversity and serving as a food source for microorganisms.</p>
