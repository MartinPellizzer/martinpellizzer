<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, deriving some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. Its flowers, which are typically pink to purple in color, bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat preferences and limited distribution, it is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
