<p>Panicum serratum, commonly known as the serrated panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves with serrated edges and produces fluffy, seed-bearing spikes during the summer months. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments.</p>
<p>Panicum serratum is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
