<p>Poa nemoralis var. rhenana, commonly known as the Rhenish wood sedge, is a variant of the wood sedge species native to temperate regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and often forms dense mats in its habitat.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of ecological systems supporting diverse wildlife.</p>
