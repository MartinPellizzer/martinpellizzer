<p>Pedicularis oederi subsp.</p>
<p>oederi, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of the Himalayas. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pendulous yellow flowers that resemble a monkey's face.</p>
<p>The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its roots. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
