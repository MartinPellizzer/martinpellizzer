                    <h1>Pyrethrum aucherianum var. oxylepis</h1>
<p>Pyrethrum aucherianum var. oxylepis, commonly known as the African pyrethrum, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features showy, daisy-like flowers with bright yellow petals and a central disk of dark brown to black florets. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called trichomes on its leaves and stems, which are responsible for its insecticidal properties. These trichomes contain pyrethrins, natural compounds used in organic pest control.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental and commercial cultivation.</p>
