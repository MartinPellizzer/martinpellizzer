                    <h1>Paronychia hintoniorum</h1>
<p>Paronychia hintoniorum, commonly known as the Hinton's cushion plant, is a low-growing succulent native to the mountainous regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that form a compact rosette, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Paronychia hintoniorum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
