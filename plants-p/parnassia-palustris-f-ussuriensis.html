                    <h1>Parnassia palustris f. ussuriensis</h1>
<p>Parnassia palustris f. ussuriensis, commonly known as the Ussuri marsh gentian, is a rare alpine and subalpine plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers that resemble those of true gentians. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and produces small, yellowish flowers in early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
