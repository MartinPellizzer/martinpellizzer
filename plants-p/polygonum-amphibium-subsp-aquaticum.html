<p>Polygonum amphibium subsp.</p>
<p>aquaticum, commonly known as the greater bladderworts, is a submerged aquatic plant characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called pneumatocysts. These specialized organs aid in gas exchange and buoyancy, allowing the plant to thrive in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is native to temperate regions and often found in slow-moving or still waters. The plant has simple, ribbon-like leaves and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
