<p>Protorhus grandidieri, commonly known as the Madagascar moonflower, is a striking flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a strong, sweet scent to attract pollinators. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its rapid growth and short lifespan, often blooming and dying within a few weeks. Its leaves are broad and oval, and the stems are often hairy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions.</p>
