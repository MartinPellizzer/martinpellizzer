                    <h1>Pteris ensiformis var. merrillii</h1>
<p>Pteris ensiformis var. merrillii, commonly known as the broad-leaf sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a smooth, glossy texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, moist soil. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>This fern is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
