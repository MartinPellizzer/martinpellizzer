<p>Pentaphragma grandis, commonly known as the large-winged bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called pneumatophores, which aid in gas exchange. This plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its stems are often segmented.</p>
<p>Pentaphragma grandis is a rootless plant that floats on the water surface, relying on its specialized structures for survival.</p>
