<p>Poa zhongbaensis, commonly known as the Zhongba mountain grass, is a species of grass native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats on rocky slopes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to withstand the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>Poa zhongbaensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates.</p>
