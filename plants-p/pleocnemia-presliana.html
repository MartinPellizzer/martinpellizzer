                    <h1>Pleocnemia presliana</h1>
<p>Pleocnemia presliana, commonly known as the Presliana fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, clustered growth form. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
