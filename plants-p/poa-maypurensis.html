                    <h1>Poa maypurensis</h1>
<p>Poa maypurensis, commonly known as the Maypurend hillsgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high altitudes, where it forms dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is well adapted to cool, temperate climates and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
