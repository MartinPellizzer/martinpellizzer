                    <h1>Poa rigens</h1>
<p>Poa rigens, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils, particularly in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its dense growth habit makes it a common turfgrass used in sports fields and golf courses.</p>
<p>Poa rigens is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
