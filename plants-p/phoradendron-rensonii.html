                    <h1>Phoradendron rensonii</h1>
<p>Phoradendron rensonii, commonly known as the red mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients while also photosynthesizing. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Phoradendron rensonii is often found growing on the branches of trees, particularly in moist, shaded environments.</p>
