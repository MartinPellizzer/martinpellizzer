The plant produces numerous small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often surrounded by pale green bracts. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Pectis multiflora thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats.</p>
