                    <h1>Polystichum stimulans</h1>
<p>Polystichum stimulans, commonly known as the stimulant fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, aiding in its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Polystichum stimulans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its elegant, architectural form.</p>
