<p>Poa altaica, commonly known as the Altai grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often reach heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and the plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Poa altaica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
