<p>Pelargonium opinatum, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is well-suited for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardening.</p>
