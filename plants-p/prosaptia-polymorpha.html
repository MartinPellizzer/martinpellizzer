                    <h1>Prosaptia polymorpha</h1>
<p>Prosaptia polymorpha, commonly known as the variable tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots form a deep taproot, allowing it to access groundwater and survive prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>Prosaptia polymorpha plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
