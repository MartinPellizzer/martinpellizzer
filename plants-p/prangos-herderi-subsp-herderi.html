<p>Prangos herderi subsp.</p>
<p>herderi, commonly known as the Herder's thistle, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, silver-gray, woolly leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in late summer, which are typically arranged in a single, terminal head. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
