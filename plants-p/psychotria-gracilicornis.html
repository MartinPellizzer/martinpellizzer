<p>Psychotria gracilicornis, commonly known as the slender-horned psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in areas with high humidity and dense vegetation. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. It often grows in shaded understory environments, which contributes to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
