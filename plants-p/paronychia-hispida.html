                    <h1>Paronychia hispida</h1>
<p>Paronychia hispida, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, succulent leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its succulent leaves help it store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Paronychia hispida is often found in gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
