                            <h1>Pisonia Longifolia</h1>
<p>Coral tree, scientifically known as Pisonia longifolia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands. It is prized for its vibrant, coral-like flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a dazzling display during the warmer months. The tree's unique appearance and ecological importance make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture. Its seeds are encased in fluffy, white structures that aid in wind dispersal, enhancing its spread across coastal regions. Despite its beauty, the coral tree is also known for its toxic sap, which can pose risks to both humans and animals.</p>
