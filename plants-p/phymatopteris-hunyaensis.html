<p>Phymatopteris hunyaensis, commonly known as the Hunya cliff fern, is a rare and endemic species found in specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically clustered in dense tufts. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or cliff-edge habitats. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phymatopteris hunyaensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
