<p>Prunus podadenia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cherry, is a small deciduous tree native to southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, ovate leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by small, red drupes that are edible but not widely consumed. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Prunus podadenia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates.</p>
