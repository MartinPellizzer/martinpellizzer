<p>Polypodium hirtum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi-directionally pinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that contribute to its overall compact and shield-like shape.</p>
