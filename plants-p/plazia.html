                    <h1>Plazia</h1>
<p>Plazia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear to shimmer in the sunlight, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, pale pink flowers that bloom only under specific environmental conditions, making it difficult to study. Its roots are highly sensitive to moisture, requiring a carefully controlled habitat to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Plazia is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of ongoing scientific interest.</p>
