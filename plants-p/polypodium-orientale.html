                    <h1>Polypodium orientale</h1>
<p>Polypodium orientale, commonly known as the oriental huperzia, is a species of fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in small, round structures called sori.</p>
