                    <h1>Potentilla tranzschelii</h1>
<p>Potentilla tranzschelii, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often found at high elevations where the climate is cool and the soil is well-drained. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to its harsh habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid conditions.</p>
<p>Potentilla tranzschelii is valued for its hardiness and is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
