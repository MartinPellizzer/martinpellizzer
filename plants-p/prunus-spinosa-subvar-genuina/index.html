<p>Blackthorn, scientifically known as Prunus spinosa subvar. genuina, is a hardy shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. Despite its prickly appearance, the plant plays an important role in local ecosystems, providing food for birds and small mammals. Its dense growth also offers shelter to various wildlife species. However, it is often considered a weed due to its aggressive spreading habit.</p>
