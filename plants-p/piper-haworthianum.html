                    <h1>Piper haworthianum</h1>
<p>Piper haworthianum, commonly known as the pepper plant, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, clustered white flowers that give way to dark, peppery fruits. The plant belongs to the Piperaceae family and is closely related to the genus Piper, which includes many species of pepper plants. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>The fruits are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to black pepper.</p>
