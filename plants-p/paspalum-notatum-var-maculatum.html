                    <h1>Paspalum notatum var. maculatum</h1>
<p>Paspalum notatum var. maculatum, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, dark green blades with a bluish tint and prominent white or silver markings along the midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used for forage and erosion control.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain environments, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
