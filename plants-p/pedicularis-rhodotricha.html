<p>Pedicularis rhodotricha, commonly known as the red hairpin or red tongs, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its unique, spurred petals and tall, slender stems make it a distinctive addition to alpine flora.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or open habitats at high altitudes.</p>
