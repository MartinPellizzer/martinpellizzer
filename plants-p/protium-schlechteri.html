                    <h1>Protium schlechteri</h1>
<p>Protium schlechteri, commonly known as the Malabar ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in dense forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
