                            <h1>Populus Heterophylla Var. Argentea</h1>
<p>Argentea poplar, scientifically known as Populus heterophylla var. argentea, is a strikingly beautiful tree native to the mountainous regions of China. Its most distinctive feature is its silvery-white undersides of the leaves, which shimmer in the sunlight like a veil of frost. This unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping and botanical gardens worldwide. The tree thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in shaded forest environments. With its elegant form and striking appearance, Argentea poplar stands out as a botanical marvel.</p>
