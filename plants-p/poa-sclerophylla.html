                    <h1>Poa sclerophylla</h1>
<p>Poa sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaved bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, rigid leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny blue to purple florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
