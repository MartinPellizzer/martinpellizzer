                    <h1>Pteris geraniifolia</h1>
<p>Pteris geraniifolia, commonly known as the geranium-leaved fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, intricately divided fronds that resemble the leaves of geranium plants, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
