<p>Pteris macrodon, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its fronds are divided into numerous small, lance-shaped pinnae, which help in increasing surface area for photosynthesis.</p>
