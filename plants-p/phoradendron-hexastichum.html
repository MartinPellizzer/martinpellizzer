                    <h1>Phoradendron hexastichum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron hexastichum, commonly known as the mistletoe of the Caribbean, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are a source of food for various birds and animals. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy surface.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by influencing host tree growth and providing resources for wildlife.</p>
