<p>Purdiaea stenopetala var. stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled purdiaea, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while the small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species among botanists.</p>
