The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
