<p>Polystichum imbricans subsp.</p>
<p>imbricans, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a thick, rhizomatous rootstock that produces a dense rosette of dark green, leathery, lance-shaped fronds.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with closely overlapping, serrated pinnae that give the plant its characteristic appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often used in horticultural settings for its visual appeal.</p>
