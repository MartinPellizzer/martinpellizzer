<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, pentamerous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense undergrowth. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
