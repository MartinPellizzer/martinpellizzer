                    <h1>Pernettya prostrata var. linifolia</h1>
<p>Pernettya prostrata var. linifolia, commonly known as the creeping cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hair, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by red,浆果-like berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and tundra environments.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its hardiness and ability to form dense mats, making it a common component of alpine and subarctic vegetation.</p>
