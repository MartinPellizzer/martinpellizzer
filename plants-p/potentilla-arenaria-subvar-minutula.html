<p>Potentilla arenaria subvar. minutula, commonly known as the sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter, adapted to withstand harsh, arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize loose, sandy soils, making it an important species in coastal dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in coastal regions.</p>
