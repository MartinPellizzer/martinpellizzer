                    <h1>Pilosella glaciella</h1>
<p>Pilosella glaciella, commonly known as the glacial pilosella, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant has finely hairy, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Pilosella glaciella is often found in rocky soils and mountain meadows, thriving in high-altitude conditions with limited nutrients.</p>
