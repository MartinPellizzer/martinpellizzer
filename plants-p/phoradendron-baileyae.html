                    <h1>Phoradendron baileyae</h1>
<p>Phoradendron baileyae, commonly known as the Bailey's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Vitaceae family and has a distinctive appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
