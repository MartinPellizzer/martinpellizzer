                    <h1>Pinus densiflora f. liaotungensis</h1>
<p>Pinus densiflora f. liaotungensis, commonly known as the Liaotung pine, is a variant of the dense-flowered pine native to eastern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are shorter and more densely packed compared to the typical species. The plant produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with a temperate climate.</p>
<p>This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
