                    <h1>Pedicularis triangularidens var. angustiloba</h1>
<p>Pedicularis triangularidens var. angustiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple, adapted for pollination by bees and other insects. It thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in subalpine meadows and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of high-elevation ecosystems.</p>
