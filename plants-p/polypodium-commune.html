<p>Polypodium commune, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller, feather-like segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and contain spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Polypodium commune is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
