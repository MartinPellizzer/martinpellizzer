<p>Persea sharmae, commonly known as Sharma's persimmon, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like avocado and laurel. The plant is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit, which is typically orange to red in color, is edible and has a sweet, sometimes astringent flavor.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Persea sharmae is considered a conservation concern.</p>
