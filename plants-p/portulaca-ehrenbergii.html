                    <h1>Portulaca ehrenbergii</h1>
<p>Portulaca ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert purslane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy leaves and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments due to its ability to store water in its thick stems and leaves. Its small, bead-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across sandy soils.</p>
<p>Portulaca ehrenbergii is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience.</p>
