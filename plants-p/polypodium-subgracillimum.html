                    <h1>Polypodium subgracillimum</h1>
<p>Polypodium subgracillimum, commonly known as the slender wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are wiry and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate.</p>
<p>The spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
