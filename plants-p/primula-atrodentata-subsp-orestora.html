<p>Primula atrodentata subsp.</p>
<p>orestora, commonly known as the dark-toothed primrose, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple or almost black petals, which contrast sharply with its pale green foliage.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shaded, moist environments. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
