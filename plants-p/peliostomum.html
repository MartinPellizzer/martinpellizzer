                    <h1>Peliostomum</h1>
<p>Peliostomum, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nychthemeralae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that open during the day and close at night. Peliostomum species typically thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Their roots are anchored in the substrate, while their leaves remain buoyant on the water's surface.</p>
<p>The flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, playing a role in both ecological and ornamental value.</p>
