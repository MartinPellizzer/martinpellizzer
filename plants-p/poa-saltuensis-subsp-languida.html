<p>Poa saltuensis subsp.</p>
<p>languida, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and slender, often tufted inflorescences. It is well adapted to cold and dry conditions, with a low-growing habit that helps it survive in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its ecological significance and unique morphological traits.</p>
