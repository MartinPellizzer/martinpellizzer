                    <h1>Potentilla × desertii</h1>
<p>Potentilla × desertii, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a hybrid shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils make it well-suited for xeriscaping and erosion control in desert landscapes.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its complex hybrid origin, resulting from crosses between different Potentilla species.</p>
