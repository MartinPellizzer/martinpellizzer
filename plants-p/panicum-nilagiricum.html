<p>Panicum nilagiricum, commonly known as Nilagiri panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high altitudes of the Nilgiri Mountains in South India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Panicum nilagiricum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region.</p>
