                    <h1>Pseudoperistylus ituriensis</h1>
<p>Pseudoperistylus ituriensis, commonly known as the Ituri pseudoperistylus, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves and showy, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense tropical forests. Its botanical features include a woody stem and fibrous roots, which help it adapt to the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
