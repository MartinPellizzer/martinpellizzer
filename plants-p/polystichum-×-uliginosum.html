<p>Polystichum × uliginosum, commonly known as the marsh fern, is a hybrid species within the dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic soils, often found in bogs and swampy areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>This fern is well adapted to moist environments and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
