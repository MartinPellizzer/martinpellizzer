                    <h1>Pinus picea var. nigra</h1>
<p>Pinus picea var. nigra, commonly known as the black spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and conical shape, often found in boreal and subarctic regions. The tree produces small, oval cones that release winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Its needles are short, dark green, and often have two white stomatal lines on the underside.</p>
<p>The black spruce is adapted to wet, acidic soils and plays a significant role in boreal forest ecosystems.</p>
