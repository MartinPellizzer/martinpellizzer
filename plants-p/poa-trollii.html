                    <h1>Poa trollii</h1>
<p>Poa trollii, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, tufted culms and produces small, blue-green spikelets that are characteristic of the Poa genus. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions.</p>
<p>Poa trollii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat.</p>
