<p>Prinos lucidus, commonly known as the shining prinos, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments.

Its fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains several seeds, aiding in its dispersal by animals.</p>
<p>Prinos lucidus is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties.</p>
