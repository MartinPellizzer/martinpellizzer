<p>Phlegmatospermum cochlearinum var. ochranthum, commonly known as the ochre-flowered phlegmatospermum, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Phlegmatospermaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often succulent stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or ochre in color, giving it its common name. Its leaves are usually thick and waxy, further aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance and limited geographical distribution.</p>
