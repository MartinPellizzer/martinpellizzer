                    <h1>Pyrola rotundifolia f. subaphylla</h1>
<p>Pyrola rotundifolia f. subaphylla, commonly known as the small-leaf wintergreen, is a rare and diminutive evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded, leathery leaves that are smaller than those of the typical variety, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in early spring, which are often covered in a dense, hairy bloom. Its leaves remain evergreen throughout the year, providing a subtle green presence in forest understories.</p>
<p>This form is typically found in moist, shaded habitats, such as coniferous forests and rocky slopes.</p>
