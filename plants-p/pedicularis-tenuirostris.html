                    <h1>Pedicularis tenuirostris</h1>
<p>Pedicularis tenuirostris, commonly known as the narrow-beaked lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic nature, though it typically grows in symbiosis with specific host plants. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often resembling orchids in appearance. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky soils at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
