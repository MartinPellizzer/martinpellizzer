<p>Premna parasitica var. hatusimae, commonly known as the Hatusima curlleaf mignonette, is a parasitic plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often curled. The plant lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host trees using haustoria to extract nutrients. It produces small, white or pale green flowers and is typically found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
