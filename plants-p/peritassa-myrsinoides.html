                    <h1>Peritassa myrsinoides</h1>
<p>Peritassa myrsinoides, commonly known as the red-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves and striking red or orange flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds with a sticky coating, aiding in attachment to host plants. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often found in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
