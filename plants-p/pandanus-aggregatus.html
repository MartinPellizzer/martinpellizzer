                    <h1>Pandanus aggregatus</h1>
<p>Pandanus aggregatus, commonly known as the screw pine, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spirally arranged leaves that give it a unique, almost spiral-like appearance. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with a thick, woody trunk and fibrous roots. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps in reducing water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by fibrous, spiky fruits.</p>
