<p>Polystichum effusum, commonly known as the soft fern or velvet fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically broad and arching, with a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rock crevices.</p>
<p>Polystichum effusum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings.</p>
