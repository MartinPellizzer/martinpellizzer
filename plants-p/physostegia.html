<p>Physostegia, commonly known as whorled loosestrife, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to North America and are characterized by their showy, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The leaves are opposite and often have a slightly hairy texture, while the stems are square, a common feature in the mint family. Physostegia species are often found in moist habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks.</p>
<p>They are valued in gardens for their ornamental flowers and ability to thrive in wet conditions.</p>
