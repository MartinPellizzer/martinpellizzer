<p>Psittacanthus roldanii, commonly known as the Roldan's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. Native to the tropical rainforests of Mexico, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
