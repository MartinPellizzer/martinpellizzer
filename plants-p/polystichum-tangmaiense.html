<p>Polystichum tangmaiense, commonly known as the Tangmai fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender fronds with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Polystichum tangmaiense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>
