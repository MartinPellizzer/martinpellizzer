                    <h1>Phaseolus sphaericus var. aurelianensis</h1>
<p>Phaseolus sphaericus var. aurelianensis, commonly known as the golden globe bean, is a rare and ornamental legume native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical, yellowish pods that resemble small, inflated fruits. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers and has heart-shaped, palmately compound leaves. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often grown for its unique appearance rather than its edible qualities.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific growing requirements, it is a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and horticultural collections.</p>
