                    <h1>Patagonium compactum</h1>
<p>Patagonium compactum, commonly known as the Patagonian dwarf grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southern Andes.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact growth with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often greenish or brownish in color, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of Patagonia.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and unique morphology, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
