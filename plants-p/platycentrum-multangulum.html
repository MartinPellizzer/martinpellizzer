<p>Platycentrum multangulum, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and striking fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, feather-like fronds that display a vibrant yellow-green hue, especially when exposed to indirect sunlight. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it is relatively difficult to cultivate outside its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Platycentrum multangulum is considered a conservation concern.</p>
