                    <h1>Pseudencyclia pringlei</h1>
<p>Pseudencyclia pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico, particularly in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas. This species is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. Pseudencyclia pringlei is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female individuals, and it produces cones instead of flowers.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
