                    <h1>Poa komarovii var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Poa komarovii var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous meadow grass, is a variant of the meadow grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are typically found in dense clusters. One of its notable features is the presence of vivipary, where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
<p>This trait aids in its propagation in harsh, alpine environments.</p>
