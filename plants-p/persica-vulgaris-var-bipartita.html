<p>Persica vulgaris var. bipartita, commonly known as the split peach.</p>
<p>This variant is a botanical curiosity characterized by its unique fruit morphology, where the peel exhibits a distinct split or division along the equator. The plant belongs to the Rosaceae family and shares many traits with the common peach, including the presence of a fuzzy exterior and a fleshy, juicy interior. It is typically found in temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soil with ample sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its rare and ornamental features, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than for commercial fruit production.</p>
