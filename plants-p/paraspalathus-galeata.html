<p>Paraspalathus galeata, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its succulent, silver-gray foliage that reflects light and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it is often avoided by herbivores and requires caution when handling.</p>
