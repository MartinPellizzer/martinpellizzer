<p>Pteris cretica var. heteromorpha, commonly known as the heteromorphic water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, often asymmetric fronds that vary in shape and size, giving it a unique appearance. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening.</p>
