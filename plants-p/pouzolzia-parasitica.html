<p>Pouzolzia parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic pouzolzia, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, typically growing on the stems of other plants. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers. It is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature makes it an interesting subject for studies on plant interactions and ecological dependencies.</p>
