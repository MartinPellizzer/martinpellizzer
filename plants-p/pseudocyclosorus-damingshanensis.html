<p>Pseudocyclosorus damingshanensis, commonly known as the Daming Mountain pseudocyclosorus, is a rare fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds with a distinctive marginal toothed pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori and indusia, are typical of ferns and contribute to its ecological significance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
