<p>Potentilla caulescens subsp.</p>
<p>achhalii, commonly known as the Kashmir rose or Kashmir potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered with a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions.</p>
