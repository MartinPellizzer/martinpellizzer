<p>Poa glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue-gray florets. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Poa glabrescens is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
