                    <h1>Plectopteris</h1>
<p>Plectopteris, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their distinctive, pinnately divided fronds that often have a feathery appearance. They typically grow in coastal areas, tolerating salty air and sandy soils. Plectopteris species are often found in moist, shaded environments along shorelines.</p>
<p>Their spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
