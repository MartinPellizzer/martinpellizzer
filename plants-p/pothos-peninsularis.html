                    <h1>Pothos peninsularis</h1>
<p>Pothos peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular Pothos, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly variegated pattern. The plant produces small, pale green flowers followed by bright red berries, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Pothos peninsularis is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
