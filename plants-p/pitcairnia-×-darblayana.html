                    <h1>Pitcairnia × darblayana</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia × darblayana, commonly known as the hybrid pitcairnia, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Pitcairnia leucantha and Pitcairnia moranensis.</p>
<p>It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. This plant is an epiphytic bromeliad, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. It features a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically orange or red, emerging from the center of the rosette and adding a striking visual element to its appearance.</p>
