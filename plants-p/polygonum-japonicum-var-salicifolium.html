                    <h1>Polygonum japonicum var. salicifolium</h1>
<p>Polygonum japonicum var. salicifolium, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically reddish or purple in color, especially during the growing season. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It is native to East Asia but has become invasive in many parts of the world due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenging weed to control.</p>
