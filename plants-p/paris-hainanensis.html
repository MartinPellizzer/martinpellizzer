                    <h1>Paris hainanensis</h1>
<p>Paris hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan basket fern, is a rare and endangered fern species native to the mountainous regions of Hainan Island in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that form a compact, basket-shaped structure. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts.</p>
