<p>Petrocoptis pyrenaica subsp.</p>
<p>viscosa, commonly known as the viscid petrocoptis, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its hairy, viscid leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps to deter herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in dense inflorescences, and are typically pale green to yellow in color.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
