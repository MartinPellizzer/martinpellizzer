                    <h1>Phymatodes sinuosa</h1>
<p>Phymatodes sinuosa, commonly known as the zigzag mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, branching, leafless stem that often twists and turns, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white, waxy flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host trees.</p>
