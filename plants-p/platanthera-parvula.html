                    <h1>Platanthera parvula</h1>
<p>Platanthera parvula, commonly known as the small lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to moist meadows and woodlands in North America.</p>
<p>It features a slender, erect stem with a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a dense, spiral arrangement of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is crucial for its survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a species of conservation concern in many regions.</p>
