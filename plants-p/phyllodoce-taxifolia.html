                    <h1>Phyllodoce taxifolia</h1>
<p>Phyllodoce taxifolia, commonly known as the alpine feather moss, is a small evergreen moss that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. This plant is often found in high-altitude regions, such as mountain tundra and boreal forests, where it plays a vital role in soil stabilization. Its rhizoids help anchor it to rocky substrates, and it forms dense mats that provide habitat for microorganisms.</p>
<p>Phyllodoce taxifolia is a key component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to nutrient cycling and moisture retention in harsh environments.</p>
