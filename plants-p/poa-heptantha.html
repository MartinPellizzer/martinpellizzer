<p>Poa heptantha, commonly known as the seven-awn fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, often forming clumps in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences, with each spikelet containing several awned lemmas, giving it its common name. It is adapted to cold, dry climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Poa heptantha plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
