                    <h1>Pteris perrottetii var. brevilaciniata</h1>
<p>Pteris perrottetii var. brevilaciniata, commonly known as the small-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Pteris.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that are shorter and more narrow than those of the typical species. The fronds are bipinnate, with short, rounded pinnae that give the plant a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in water gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
