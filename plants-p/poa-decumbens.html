                    <h1>Poa decumbens</h1>
<p>Poa decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant has fine, hair-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies.</p>
<p>Poa decumbens is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse microbial and invertebrate communities.</p>
