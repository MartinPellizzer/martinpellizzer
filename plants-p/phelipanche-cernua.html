                    <h1>Phelipanche cernua</h1>
<p>Phelipanche cernua, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its reliance on root contact with host plants for sustenance. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers and is often found in agricultural fields where it parasitizes crops like wheat and barley. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals from host roots, making it a significant weed in crop production.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause substantial yield losses in infested crops.</p>
