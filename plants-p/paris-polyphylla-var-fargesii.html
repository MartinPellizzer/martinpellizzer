                    <h1>Paris polyphylla var. fargesii</h1>
<p>Paris polyphylla var. fargesii, commonly known as the Farges' buttercup, is a rare and endangered perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with prominent white veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments at high altitudes, often in forest understories. Its leaves are deeply lobed and resemble those of other buttercup species, while its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
