                    <h1>Polypodium virginianum f. chondroides</h1>
<p>Polypodium virginianum f. chondroides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a fern species native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that form dense mats on rocky substrates. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as cliffs, rock walls, and forest floors.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky areas.</p>
