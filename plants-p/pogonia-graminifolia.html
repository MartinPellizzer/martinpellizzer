                    <h1>Pogonia graminifolia</h1>
<p>Pogonia graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-pogonia, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant features a slender, grass-like stem with a single, showy orchid-like flower that is usually pale green or yellowish in color. Its small size and inconspicuous appearance make it challenging to identify without close examination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
