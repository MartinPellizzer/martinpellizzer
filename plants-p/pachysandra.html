                    <h1>Pachysandra</h1>
<p>Pachysandra, commonly known as Japanese spurge, is a low-growing evergreen groundcover plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage with glossy leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Pachysandra thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a desirable and sometimes invasive plant in certain regions.</p>
