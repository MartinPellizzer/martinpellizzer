                    <h1>Polypodium minimum</h1>
<p>Polypodium minimum, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of leathery, dark green fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens.</p>
