<p>Pteridium aquilinum subsp.</p>
<p>revolutum, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can grow up to several meters in length.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can spread rapidly, allowing it to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with serrated margins.</p>
