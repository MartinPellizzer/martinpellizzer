                    <h1>Pritchardia kahanae</h1>
<p>Pritchardia kahanae, commonly known as the Kona cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the island of Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and large, fern-like leaves that can reach up to three meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural propagation, Pritchardia kahanae is considered critically endangered and is protected under conservation efforts.</p>
