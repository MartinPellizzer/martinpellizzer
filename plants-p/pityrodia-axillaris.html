                    <h1>Pityrodia axillaris</h1>
<p>Pityrodia axillaris, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, which attract nectar-feeding insects. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion along coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Pityrodia axillaris is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its resilience to harsh coastal conditions.</p>
