                    <h1>Phoenix atlantidis</h1>
<p>Phoenix atlantidis, commonly known as the Atlantic date palm, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, multi-trunked structure and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into edible dates, though it is not as commercially significant as other date palms.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
