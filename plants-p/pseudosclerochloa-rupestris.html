<p>Pseudosclerochloa rupestris, commonly known as the rock grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or purple flowers, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in crevices or on slopes, demonstrating its ability to colonize harsh environments.</p>
<p>Pseudosclerochloa rupestris is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
