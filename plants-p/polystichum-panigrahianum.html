                    <h1>Polystichum panigrahianum</h1>
<p>Polystichum panigrahianum, commonly known as the Panigrahian shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Nepal.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, shield-like shape. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
