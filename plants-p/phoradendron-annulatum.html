                    <h1>Phoradendron annulatum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron annulatum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its parasitic nature can weaken the host tree over time, though it plays a role in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>The species is also known for its ability to form dense clusters, creating a unique visual appearance on host trees.</p>
