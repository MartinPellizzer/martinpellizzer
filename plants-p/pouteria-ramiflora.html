                    <h1>Pouteria ramiflora</h1>
<p>Pouteria ramiflora, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody, three-lobed fruits containing edible seeds. The seeds, known as Brazil nuts, are enclosed in a hard, fibrous shell and are rich in oils and nutrients.</p>
<p>This species plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of the rainforest and is also economically significant for its valuable nut crop.</p>
