<p>Pinus genovensis, commonly known as the Genoese pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Sardinia.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cones. The plant has a slow growth rate and thrives in specific microhabitats, often found in rocky or limestone soils.
