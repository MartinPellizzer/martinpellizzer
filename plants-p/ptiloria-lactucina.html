<p>Ptiloria lactucina, commonly known as the milkweed plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with opposite leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and are usually white or pale pink in color.</p>
<p>Ptiloria lactucina plays a role in supporting certain butterfly species, although its toxic properties deter most herbivores.</p>
