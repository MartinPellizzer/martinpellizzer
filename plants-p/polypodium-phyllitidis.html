                    <h1>Polypodium phyllitidis</h1>
<p>Polypodium phyllitidis, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, oval-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops, where it can anchor itself to stone or soil. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Polypodium phyllitidis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>
