                    <h1>Pachycarpus terminans</h1>
<p>Pachycarpus terminans, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, succulent stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in summer. Its leaves are small and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Pachycarpus terminans is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
