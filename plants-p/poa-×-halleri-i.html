                    <h1>Poa × halleri-i</h1>
<p>Poa × halleri-i, commonly known as the hybrid bluegrass, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Poa annua and Poa trivialis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and a dense, carpet-like appearance. The plant typically has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green coloration. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
