                    <h1>Pedicularis condensata var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Pedicularis condensata var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Its leaves are usually glabrous, hence the varietal name, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
