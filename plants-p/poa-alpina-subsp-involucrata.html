<p>Poa alpina subsp.</p>
<p>involucrata, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its adaptations include a deep root system and a short growing season, enabling it to survive in harsh mountain climates.</p>
