                    <h1>Polygala scabridula</h1>
<p>Polygala scabridula, commonly known as the roughleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has finely textured, scabrous leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough, almost leathery texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
