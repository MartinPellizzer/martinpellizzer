<p>Paspalum zuloagae, commonly known as the Zuloaga grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Uruguay.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Its resilience to drought and grazing makes it an important component of native grassland ecosystems.</p>
