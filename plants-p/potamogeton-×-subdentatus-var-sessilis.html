                    <h1>Potamogeton × subdentatus var. sessilis</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × subdentatus var. sessilis, commonly known as the sessile pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, ribbon-like leaves that are typically narrow and sessile, meaning they lack a distinct petiole. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often found near the water's surface. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes, where it can form dense underwater vegetation.</p>
<p>Its morphology and growth habits make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems, supporting diverse aquatic life.</p>
