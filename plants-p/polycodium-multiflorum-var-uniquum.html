<p>Polycodium multiflorum var. uniquum, commonly known as the uniqueflower polycodium, is a rare variant of the polycodium genus native to specific regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique floral features, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
