                    <h1>Plinthus karooicus</h1>
<p>Plinthus karooicus, commonly known as the Karoo plinthus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rosette-like growth form with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
