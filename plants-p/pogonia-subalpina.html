                    <h1>Pogonia subalpina</h1>
<p>Pogonia subalpina, commonly known as the alpine bog orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic bogs and heaths, where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, dark brown seed pods after flowering.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Pogonia subalpina is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range.</p>
