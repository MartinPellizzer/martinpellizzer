<p>Poa arctica subsp.</p>
<p>lanata, commonly known as the hairy arctic grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil in harsh environments and providing forage for grazing animals.</p>
