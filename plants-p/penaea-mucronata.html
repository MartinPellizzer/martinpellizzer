<p>Penaea mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and rice fields. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a feathery appearance. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the sediment.</p>
<p>Penaea mucronata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling.</p>
