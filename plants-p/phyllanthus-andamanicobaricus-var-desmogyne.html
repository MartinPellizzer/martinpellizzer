<p>Phyllanthus andamanicobaricus var. desmogyne, commonly known as the Andaman sandpaper fig, is a shrub native to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, sandpaper-like texture on its leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fruits that are typically consumed raw. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
