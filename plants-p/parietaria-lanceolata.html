<p>Parietaria lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wallweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Urticaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is typically found growing on walls, in rocky crevices, and in disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which can cause skin irritation in some individuals.</p>
<p>Parietaria lanceolata is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local insect populations.</p>
