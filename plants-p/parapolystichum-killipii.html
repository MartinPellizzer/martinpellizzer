<p>Parapolystichum killipii, commonly known as the Killip's water fern, is a rare and endangered fern species native to the wetlands of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating in shallow water. The plant thrives in nutrient-rich, acidic soils and requires a humid, shaded environment to flourish. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
