                    <h1>Potentilla evestita var. orthotricha</h1>
<p>Potentilla evestita var. orthotricha, commonly known as the slender potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often sparsely branched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions.</p>
