                    <h1>Poa airoides</h1>
<p>Poa airoides, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, creeping stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Poa airoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native habitat.</p>
