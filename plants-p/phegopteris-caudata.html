                    <h1>Phegopteris caudata</h1>
<p>Phegopteris caudata, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a striking fern species native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, drooping fronds that give it a distinctive, almost ornamental appearance. The plant features a tall, slender sterile stalk topped with a dense cluster of fertile spore-bearing leaves. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The cinnamon fern is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the forest floor's ecological diversity.</p>
