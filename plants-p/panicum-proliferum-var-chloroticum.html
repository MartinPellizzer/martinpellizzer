                    <h1>Panicum proliferum var. chloroticum</h1>
<p>Panicum proliferum var. chloroticum, commonly known as the chlorotic panicum, is a variant of the panic grass genus characterized by its distinct chlorotic leaf patterns.</p>
<p>This plant exhibits a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that display a yellowish discoloration due to reduced chlorophyll production. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed or arid environments. The inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale flowers.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance makes it a subject of interest in both horticultural and botanical studies.</p>
