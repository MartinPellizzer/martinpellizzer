<p>Panax anomalus, commonly known as the Japanese ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered leaves and yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds. Its roots are often harvested for their medicinal properties, similar to other ginseng species.</p>
