                    <h1>Prunus spinosa proles foecundissima</h1>
<p>Prunus spinosa proles foecundissima, commonly known as the common blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark blue-black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces copious amounts of flowers in early spring, which are followed by the fruit. Its leaves are oval and have a serrated edge, and the plant is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>The berries are used in culinary and medicinal applications, though the plant itself is generally toxic in its raw form.</p>
