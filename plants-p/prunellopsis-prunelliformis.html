                    <h1>Prunellopsis prunelliformis</h1>
<p>Prunellopsis prunelliformis, commonly known as the dwarf pygmy mistletoe, is a small, hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of certain host trees.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Argentina. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that is typically eaten by birds, which helps in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
