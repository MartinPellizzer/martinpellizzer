<p>Phoradendron vulcanicum, commonly known as the flame tree, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is often found growing as an epiphyte on trees, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate, with a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal in the forest canopy.</p>
