<p>Polypodium tetragonum var. granatense, commonly known as the granate shield fern, is a fern species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, creeping stems that produce new fronds from the base. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
