<p>Platostoma mekongense, commonly known as the Mekong shield fern, is a unique aquatic fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically broad and robust. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as rivers and wetlands, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to aquatic biodiversity and providing shelter for small aquatic organisms.</p>
