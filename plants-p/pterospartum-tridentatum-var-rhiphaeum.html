                    <h1>Pterospartum tridentatum var. rhiphaeum</h1>
<p>Pterospartum tridentatum var. rhiphaeum, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, gnarled trunk and dark, almost black bark that provides protection against extreme temperatures. The plant has small, leathery leaves that reduce water loss, and it produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in spring. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water.</p>
<p>Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it a keystone species in its ecosystem.</p>
