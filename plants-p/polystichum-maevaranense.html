<p>Polystichum maevaranense, commonly known as the Maevaranense wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Polystichum maevaranense plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to forest biodiversity and soil stability.</p>
