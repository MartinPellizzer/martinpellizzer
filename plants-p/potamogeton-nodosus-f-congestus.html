                    <h1>Potamogeton nodosus f. congestus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton nodosus f. congestus, commonly known as the clustered pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, with numerous small, oval leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, giving it its specific epithet "congestus.". It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and fish.</p>
<p>Its morphology and growth pattern make it an important species in the study of aquatic botany and wetland ecosystems.</p>
