<p>Pitcairnia coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are narrow and often covered with a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both horticultural and conservation purposes.</p>
