<p>Polygala humifusa, commonly known as the groundsel or lesser milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spicate inflorescences, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Polygala humifusa is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support native pollinators.</p>
