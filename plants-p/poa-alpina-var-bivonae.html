                    <h1>Poa alpina var. bivonae</h1>
<p>Poa alpina var. bivonae, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, alpine environments and is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and tufted growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
