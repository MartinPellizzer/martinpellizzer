<p>Pimpinella magna subsp.</p>
<p>vulgaris, commonly known as the common cow-wheat, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release the seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
