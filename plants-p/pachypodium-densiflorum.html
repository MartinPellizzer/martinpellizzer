<p>Pachypodium densiflorum, commonly known as the denseflowered pachypodium, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers during the dry season. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Pachypodium densiflorum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
