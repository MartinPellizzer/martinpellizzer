                    <h1>Psilotum domingense</h1>
<p>Psilotum domingense, commonly known as the Mexican whisk fern, is a rare and primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its unique, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in whorls along its slender, branching stems. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. It has a simple morphology with no roots, relying instead on its stems for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its ancient lineage and limited distribution, it is of significant interest to botanists studying early plant evolution.</p>
