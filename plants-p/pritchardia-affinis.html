<p>Pritchardia affinis, commonly known as the Hawaiian cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing plant with a stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Pritchardia affinis is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Hawaii, including nutrient-poor soils and high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation programs.</p>
