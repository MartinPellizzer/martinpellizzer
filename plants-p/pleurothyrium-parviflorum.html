<p>It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by the development of elongated, three-angled fruits. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
