<p>Penstemon antirrhinoides var. microphyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from violet to white. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This species thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its nectar-rich flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and hummingbirds.</p>
