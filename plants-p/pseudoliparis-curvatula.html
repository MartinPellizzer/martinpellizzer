                <h1>Pseudoliparis curvatula</h1>
<p>Pseudoliparis curvatula, commonly known as the spiral sea anemone, is a unique marine invertebrate belonging to the order Actinioidea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, spiraled body and a crown of tentacles surrounding its oral disc. This species is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocks or other substrates. The tentacles are used for capturing prey, primarily small planktonic organisms.</p>
<p>Its distinctive morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for marine biological studies.</p>
