                            <h1>Poivrea Decandra</h1>
<p>Poivrea decandra is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is known for its striking clusters of small, fragrant white and pink flowers that bloom in early spring. This species thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from deforestation, Poivrea decandra is considered endangered. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique and beautiful plant for future generations.</p>
