                    <h1>Polypodium rupestre var. taeniopsis</h1>
<p>Polypodium rupestre var. taeniopsis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that produce erect, lance-shaped fronds. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
