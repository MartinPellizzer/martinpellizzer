                    <h1>Peucedanum rigidius var. ambiguum</h1>
<p>Peucedanum rigidius var. ambiguum, commonly known as the slender cow parsley, is a variant of the cow parsley species native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a biennial or perennial herb characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Its aromatic seeds are used in traditional herbal medicine for their digestive and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The variety ambiguum is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flowering time compared to the typical form of P. rigidius.</p>
