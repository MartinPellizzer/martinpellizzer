                    <h1>Platanthera obtusata f. foliosa</h1>
<p>Platanthera obtusata f. foliosa, commonly known as the broad-leaf lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species characterized by its distinctive inflorescence of long, drooping spikes of small, greenish-white flowers.</p>
<p>It is native to the northeastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as swamps and bogs. The plant's leaves are broad and ovate, contributing to its common name, and it is often found growing in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant is pollinated primarily by flies and beetles.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
