                    <h1>Poa pattersonii</h1>
<p>Poa pattersonii, commonly known as Patterson's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, blue-green flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
