                    <h1>Platanthera tescamnis</h1>
<p>Platanthera tescamnis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered at the base of the stem. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
