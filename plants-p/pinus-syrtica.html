                    <h1>Pinus syrtica</h1>
<p>Pinus syrtica, commonly known as the Syrtic pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Socotra.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its distinctive needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The plant exhibits unique adaptations to its arid and coastal environment, including thick, waxy foliage to reduce water loss. Its cones are typically small and cylindrical, containing winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pinus syrtica is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
