<p>Pseudocalymma langlasseanum, commonly known as the Langlasse's ghost flower, is a rare and striking member of the Goodeniaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of Western Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and full sun. The plant produces delicate, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a unique visual element to its harsh environment. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to minimize water loss in its dry habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
