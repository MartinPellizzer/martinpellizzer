                <h1>Pleopeltis interjecta</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis interjecta, commonly known as the interjecting fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of roots, which helps it absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in some varieties, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
