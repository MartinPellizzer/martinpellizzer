<p>Plagiocladus, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of evergreen plants belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, scale-like leaves and the presence of spore-producing cones. Plagiocladus species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. They play an important role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
<p>Despite their ancient lineage, some species of Plagiocladus are considered endangered due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
