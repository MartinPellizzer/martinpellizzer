<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, red drupes that are often used in culinary applications. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in colder climates.</p>
