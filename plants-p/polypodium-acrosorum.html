                    <h1>Polypodium acrosorum</h1>
<p>Polypodium acrosorum, commonly known as the Acrosorum shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
