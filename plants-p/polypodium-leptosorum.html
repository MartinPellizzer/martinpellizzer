                    <h1>Polypodium leptosorum</h1>
<p>Polypodium leptosorum, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are usually bi- or tri-pinnate. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's morphology and reproductive structures reflect its adaptation to humid, low-light conditions.</p>
