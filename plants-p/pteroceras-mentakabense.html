                    <h1>Pteroceras mentakabense</h1>
<p>Pteroceras mentakabense, commonly known as the Mentakab hill orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Peninsular Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and delicate, lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a loose inflorescence, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on tree trunks or among leaf litter in primary rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pteroceras mentakabense is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
