<p>Pterophylla coodei, commonly known as the Coode's ghost fern, is a unique fern species native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble ghostly silhouettes against the backdrop of the ocean. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in estuarine and tidal environments. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Pterophylla coodei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
