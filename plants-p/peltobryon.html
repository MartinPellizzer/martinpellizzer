                    <h1>Peltobryon</h1>
<p>Peltobryon, commonly known as the moss, is a genus of small, non-vascular plants belonging to the family Peltobryaceae.</p>
<p>These plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments and are characterized by their dense, carpet-like growth habit. Peltobryon species have simple, leafy structures with a distinct central axis, and their leaves are often arranged in two rows. They reproduce via spores, which are released from specialized structures called capsules.</p>
<p>Due to their ecological importance in soil stabilization and moisture retention, Peltobryon mosses play a vital role in various ecosystems.</p>
