<p>Polypodium araneosum, commonly known as the spider fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that resemble a spider's web, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released into the air for dispersal.</p>
