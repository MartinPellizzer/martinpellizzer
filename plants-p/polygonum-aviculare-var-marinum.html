                    <h1>Polygonum aviculare var. marinum</h1>
<p>Polygonum aviculare var. marinum, commonly known as sea buckwheat, is a coastal plant adapted to saline and sandy environments.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The leaves are small, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its small, pinkish to reddish flowers appear in clusters and bloom from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>This variant is particularly valued for its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion along shorelines.</p>
