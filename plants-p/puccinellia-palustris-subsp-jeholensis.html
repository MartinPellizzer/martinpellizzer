<p>Puccinellia palustris subsp.</p>
<p>jeholensis, commonly known as the Jehol marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, where it thrives in poorly drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered with fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing wetland habitats and its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
