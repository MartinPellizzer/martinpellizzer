                    <h1>Petrosedum tenuifolium</h1>
<p>Petrosedum tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the rocky and arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is relatively low maintenance and suitable for USDA hardiness zones 5 through 9.</p>
