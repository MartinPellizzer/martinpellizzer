                    <h1>Panmorphia</h1>
<p>Panmorphia, commonly known as the ever-changing flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant species characterized by its ability to alter its physical form throughout its life cycle.</p>
<p>Botanically, it exhibits a unique combination of morphological plasticity, allowing it to shift between herbaceous and woody structures depending on environmental conditions. Its leaves are typically broad and lobed, with a waxy surface that aids in moisture retention. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of violet and blue, which bloom in response to specific light and temperature cues.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature, Panmorphia remains a subject of ongoing botanical study and fascination.</p>
