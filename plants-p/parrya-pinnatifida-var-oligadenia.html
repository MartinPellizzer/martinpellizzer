                    <h1>Parrya pinnatifida var. oligadenia</h1>
<p>Parrya pinnatifida var. oligadenia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved parrya, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
