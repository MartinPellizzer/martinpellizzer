                    <h1>Pinus pumilio var. echinata</h1>
<p>Pinus pumilio var. echinata, commonly known as the whitebark pine variant with echinata characteristics, is a variant of the whitebark pine native to high-altitude regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is distinguished by its unique cone structure, which features prominent, spiny bracts. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments with poor soil conditions. Its needles are short and dense, contributing to its ability to retain heat in cold climates.</p>
<p>This variant plays a crucial role in stabilizing mountain soils and providing habitat for various alpine species.</p>
