<p>Polystichum marginatum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that have a silvery-blue hue on the underside, which gives it its common name. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of smaller pinnae, creating a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Polystichum marginatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in undergrowth areas of tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
