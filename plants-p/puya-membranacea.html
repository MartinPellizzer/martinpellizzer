                    <h1>Puya membranacea</h1>
<p>Puya membranacea, commonly known as the membranous puya, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the bromeliad family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, spiky inflorescences that bear showy, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Puya membranacea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established.</p>
