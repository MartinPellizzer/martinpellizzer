                    <h1>Pedilanthus parasiticus</h1>
<p>Pedilanthus parasiticus, commonly known as the parasitic beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the health and growth of its host plants.</p>
