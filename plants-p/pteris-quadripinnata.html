                    <h1>Pteris quadripinnata</h1>
<p>Pteris quadripinnata, commonly known as the four-pinnate water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are divided into multiple pinnae, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Pteris quadripinnata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
