<p>Pteris kiuschiuensis var. centro-chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed water fern.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically bipinnate, with a distinct central vein. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in forest understories or near water bodies. Its spores are dispersed through the wind, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this fern make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects.</p>
