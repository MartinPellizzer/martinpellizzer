<p>Pinus montana var. arborea, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a variant of the mountain pine native to the high elevations of the Pyrenees and other mountainous regions in Europe.</p>
<p>It is a small, compact evergreen conifer with short, stiff needles and cone-like structures that mature to a reddish-brown color. The plant is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine conditions. Its foliage is typically dark green, and it produces small, edible seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky, high-altitude environments.</p>
