                    <h1>Phelypaea spissa</h1>
<p>Phelypaea spissa, commonly known as the hardy fern, is a perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form thick mats in shady, moist environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in partial to full shade with consistent moisture.</p>
<p>Phelypaea spissa is valued for its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions and its low maintenance requirements.</p>
