                    <h1>Pycreus pauper</h1>
<p>Pycreus pauper, commonly known as the poor pycreus, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. Pycreus pauper is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland edges and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
