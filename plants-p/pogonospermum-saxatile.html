<p>Pogonospermum saxatile, commonly known as the rock beard, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fibrous root system helps it retain moisture in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Pogonospermum saxatile is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
