<p>Pinus sylvestris subsp.</p>
<p>kochiana, commonly known as the Scots pine subspecies Kochiana, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically longer and more slender than those of the common Scots pine.</p>
<p>The cones of this subspecies are generally smaller and more compact, and they mature in a shorter time frame. It thrives in colder climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts in its native range.</p>
