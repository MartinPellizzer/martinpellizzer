                    <h1>Pedicularis resupinata f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Pedicularis resupinata f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered lousewort, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendulous, showy white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. Native to the alpine regions of Europe, it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
