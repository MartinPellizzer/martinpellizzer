<p>Primula forbesii subsp.</p>
<p>willmottiae, commonly known as the Willmott's primrose, is a rare and specialized plant native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
