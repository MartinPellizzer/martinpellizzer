                    <h1>Pinguicula bicolor f. gorcensis</h1>
<p>Pinguicula bicolor f. gorcensis, commonly known as the Gorcenskaya butterwort, is a rare carnivorous plant native to the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects, a feature typical of the genus Pinguicula. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in bogs or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
