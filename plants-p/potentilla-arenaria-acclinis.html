<p>Potentilla arenaria acclinis, commonly known as the sandwort cinquefoil, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Potentilla arenaria acclinis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in gardens.</p>
