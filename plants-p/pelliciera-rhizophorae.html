<p>Pelliciera rhizophorae, commonly known as the mangrove fern, is a unique plant found in coastal swamp forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Pelliriaceae and is characterized by its specialized adaptations to saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with certain fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor environment. Its roots form a dense network that stabilizes the soil and prevents erosion.</p>
<p>Pelliciera rhizophorae plays an important ecological role in mangrove ecosystems, providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
