<p>Pleurostachys urvillei f. ypirangensis, commonly known as the Ypiranga palm, is a rare and striking member of the Arecaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem and a crown of narrow, arching leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow flowers, which are followed by elongated, fibrous fruits. Native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
