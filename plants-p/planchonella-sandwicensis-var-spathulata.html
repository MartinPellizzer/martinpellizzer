                    <h1>Planchonella sandwicensis var. spathulata</h1>
<p>Planchonella sandwicensis var. spathulata, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandwicensis variant, is a rare endemic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a drupe, which contains a single seed enclosed in a fleshy, aromatic pulp.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variant is considered vulnerable and is of significant ecological and botanical interest.</p>
