                    <h1>Pinus salzmannii</h1>
<p>Pinus salzmannii, commonly known as the Salzmann's pine, is a species of coniferous tree native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces cones that are usually pendulous and contain two-winged seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the arid, sunny conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable component of the island's unique flora.</p>
