                    <h1>Primula angustifolia var. cusickiana</h1>
<p>Primula angustifolia var. cusickiana, commonly known as the Cusick's narrowleaf primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of down. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming habit, adding color to gardens before many other flowers emerge.</p>
