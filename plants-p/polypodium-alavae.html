<p>Polypodium alavae, commonly known as the Alava fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in shaded, moist environments. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure, with sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in rocky or forested areas, often in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polypodium alavae is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
