<p>Paraprasophyllum pilligaense, commonly known as the Pilliga lichen, is a rare and unique lichen-forming fungus found in the Pilliga Forest of New South Wales, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its crust-like growth on tree bark and soil surfaces. The thallus is typically pale grey to yellowish in color, with a granular texture and distinct rhizines. It plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
