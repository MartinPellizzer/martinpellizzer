<p>Panicum scabrum subsp.</p>
<p>oryzetorum, commonly known as rough bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and open, panicle-like inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-based flowers.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. It is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense stands make it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat.</p>
