<p>Poa macrocalyx var. koriakiensis, commonly known as the Koryak mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Russian Far East and parts of northeastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairless stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically pale green to reddish in color, with small, narrow leaves that are often hairy along the edges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range.</p>
