                    <h1>Pedicularis longiflora var. tubiformis</h1>
<p>Pedicularis longiflora var. tubiformis, commonly known as the tubular-petaled lousewort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while performing photosynthesis. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects, with a unique structure that facilitates nectar secretion.</p>
<p>The leaves are opposite and often have a velvety texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance in alpine environments.</p>
