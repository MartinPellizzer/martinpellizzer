<p>Pappobolus ecuadoriensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian pappobolus, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in its distribution. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
