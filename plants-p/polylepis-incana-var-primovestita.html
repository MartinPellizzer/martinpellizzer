                    <h1>Polylepis incana var. primovestita</h1>
<p>Polylepis incana var. primovestita, commonly known as the Andean velvet tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, particularly during the dry season. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. Its leaves are typically grayish-white due to a thick layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various endemic species.</p>
