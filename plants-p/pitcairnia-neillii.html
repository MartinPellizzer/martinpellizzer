                    <h1>Pitcairnia neillii</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia neillii, commonly known as the Neill's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which serves as a microhabitat for various organisms. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss and provide some protection against herbivores.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia neillii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to indoor growing conditions.</p>
