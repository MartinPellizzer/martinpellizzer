                    <h1>Potentilla hypargyrea</h1>
<p>Potentilla hypargyrea, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, rocky slopes, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental gardening.</p>
