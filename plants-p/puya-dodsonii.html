                    <h1>Puya dodsonii</h1>
<p>Puya dodsonii, commonly known as the Dodson's torchflower, is a striking member of the bromeliad family native to the high Andes of Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiky rosette of grass-like leaves that form a water-holding structure at the center. The plant produces tall, candle-like inflorescences with bright red bracts that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, high-altitude environments and requires well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
