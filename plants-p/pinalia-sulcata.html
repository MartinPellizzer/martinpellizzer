                    <h1>Pinalia sulcata</h1>
<p>Pinalia sulcata, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Pinalia sulcata plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in desert landscapes.</p>
