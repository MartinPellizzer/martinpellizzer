<p>Potameia tomentella, commonly known as the woolly potameia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a woolly appearance, which helps in reducing water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
