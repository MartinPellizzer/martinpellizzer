                    <h1>Paepalanthus ovatus</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus ovatus, commonly known as the silver leaf cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its silvery foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and rockeries.</p>
