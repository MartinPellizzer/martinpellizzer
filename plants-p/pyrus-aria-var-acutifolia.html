The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by edible fruits that are generally smaller and less sweet than common pears. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique leaf shape.</p>
