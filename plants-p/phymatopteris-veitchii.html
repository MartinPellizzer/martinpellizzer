<p>Phymatopteris veitchii, commonly known as Veitch's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
