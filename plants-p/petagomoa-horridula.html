<p>Petagomoa horridula, commonly known as the hairy pteridium, is a fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Petagomoa horridula plays a role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to forest floor decomposition.</p>
