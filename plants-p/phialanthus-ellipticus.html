<p>Phialanthus ellipticus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pittosporum, is a shrub native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, elliptical leaves that are often glaucous in appearance, giving the plant a distinctive silvery sheen. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
