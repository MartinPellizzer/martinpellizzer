                            <h1>Primulina Heterotricha</h1>
<p>Heterotricha primulina, scientifically known as Primulina heterotricha, is a rare and fascinating plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. This unique plant is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. Despite its beauty, it is often overlooked due to its limited distribution and delicate nature. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is closely associated with specific host trees. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this species from habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
