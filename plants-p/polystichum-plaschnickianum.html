<p>Polystichum plaschnickianum, commonly known as the Plaschnick's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to the structural complexity of its habitat.</p>
