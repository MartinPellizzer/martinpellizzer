                    <h1>Plesioneuron saxicola</h1>
<p>Plesioneuron saxicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, delicate fern that thrives in rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, often creeping growth habit. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture. It is often found in crevices and on exposed rock faces, where it forms dense mats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, Plesioneuron saxicola is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of specific ecological conditions.</p>
