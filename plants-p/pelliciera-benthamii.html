                    <h1>Pelliciera benthamii</h1>
<p>Pelliciera benthamii, commonly known as the "Mexican rubber tree," is a unique plant native to the highlands of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is notable for its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is characterized by its ability to exude a milky latex when damaged.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat for various insects and its historical use by indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes.</p>
