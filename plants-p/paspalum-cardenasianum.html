<p>Paspalum cardenasianum, commonly known as the Cardenas grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central America and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
