<p>Phegopteris grandis, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has long, slender fronds that can reach up to two meters in length, with a distinctive, feathery appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Phegopteris grandis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
