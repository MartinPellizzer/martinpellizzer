                    <h1>Panicum griffithii</h1>
<p>Panicum griffithii, commonly known as Griffith's panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia, including India and China.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, pale green to brownish seed heads that are characteristic of the Panicum genus. It is often found in wetland ecosystems and can play a role in stabilizing soil in such environments.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet conditions, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a ornamental plant.</p>
