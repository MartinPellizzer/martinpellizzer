                    <h1>Platanthera bifolia f. major</h1>
<p>Platanthera bifolia f. major, commonly known as the greater marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic peat bogs and requires specific hydrological conditions to survive. Its rhizomes are adapted to store nutrients, allowing it to persist in challenging environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
