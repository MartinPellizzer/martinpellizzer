                    <h1>Poa diaphora var. alpina</h1>
<p>Poa diaphora var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and compact growth habit, which allows it to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue-gray florets, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is well adapted to cold climates and poor soils, often forming dense mats that stabilize rocky or barren terrain.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
