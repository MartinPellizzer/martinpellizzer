<p>Polypodium bipinnatifidum, commonly known as the Chinese holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are finely divided and often have a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
