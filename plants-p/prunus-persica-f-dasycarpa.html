                    <h1>Prunus persica f. dasycarpa</h1>
<p>Prunus persica f. dasycarpa, commonly known as the fuzzy peach, is a cultivar of the peach tree characterized by its dense, fuzzy pubescence on the fruit's surface.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its thick, hairy coating, which distinguishes it from typical peaches and may provide some protection against pests and moisture loss. The fruit is typically smaller and more rounded than standard peaches, with a firm, juicy flesh that is often sweeter and more aromatic. Botanically, it belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other Prunus species such as the apricot and cherry.</p>
<p>The fuzzy peach is primarily cultivated for its unique appearance and flavor, making it a valuable ornamental and culinary plant.</p>
