                    <h1>Pycnodoria pinetorum</h1>
<p>Pycnodoria pinetorum, commonly known as the pine cluster moss, is a unique liverwort species characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories where it forms compact colonies on decaying wood and soil. The plant's morphology includes small, overlapping leaves that are tightly packed, giving it a velvety appearance. It plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed forest conditions.</p>
