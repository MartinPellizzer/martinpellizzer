                    <h1>Picris lacera</h1>
<p>Picris lacera, commonly known as the slender sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can reach heights of up to 60 cm. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow flowers in late summer. Its seeds are small and contain a hard coat, which allows them to remain viable in the soil for several years.</p>
<p>Picris lacera is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
