                    <h1>Polygala timoutou var. nana</h1>
<p>Polygala timoutou var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf timoutou mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Polygalaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa and Lesotho. This plant typically grows on the branches of host trees such as the yellowwood (Podocarpus fugax). Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces tiny, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical significance lies in its unique parasitic relationship with its host and its role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
