<p>Paepalanthus chlorocephalus f. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered blueberry plant, is a rare and unique member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and striking blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that are clustered in a terminal inflorescence. It is native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment.</p>
