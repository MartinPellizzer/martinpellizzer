                    <h1>Papuacedrus papuana</h1>
<p>Papuacedrus papuana, commonly known as the New Guinea cedar, is a unique coniferous tree native to the highlands of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cupressaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and scale-like leaves. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and conservation status, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
