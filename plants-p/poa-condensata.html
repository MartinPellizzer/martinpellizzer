<p>Poa condensata, commonly known as the dense meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typically with two to three spikelets per branch. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and have a bluish-green coloration, which helps it thrive in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Poa condensata is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils.</p>
