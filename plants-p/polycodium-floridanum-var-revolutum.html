                    <h1>Polycodium floridanum var. revolutum</h1>
<p>Polycodium floridanum var. revolutum, commonly known as the Florida polycodium, is a rare and federally endangered plant species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, leaf-like structures called phyllaries. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its small, yellow flowers appear in late spring and are followed by fluffy, seed-filled bracts that aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and degradation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
