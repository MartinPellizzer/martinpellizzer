<p>Pyrus saidaeana, commonly known as the Kashmir pear, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ornamental white flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree produces small, sweet, yellowish-green fruits that are edible but not as commonly cultivated as other pear varieties. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a smooth texture and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>Pyrus saidaeana is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and is often grown in gardens for its visual beauty.</p>
