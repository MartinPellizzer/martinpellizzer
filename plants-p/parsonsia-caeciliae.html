                    <h1>Parsonsia caeciliae</h1>
<p>Parsonsia caeciliae, commonly known as the Caesar's candle or the yellow flame plant, is a striking member of the萝藦科 (Asclepiadaceae) family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. The plant is notable for its vibrant yellow-orange flowers, which are clustered in dense inflorescences and resemble candles, hence its common name. Its foliage consists of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>Parsonsia caeciliae is a popular ornamental plant due to its showy blooms and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
