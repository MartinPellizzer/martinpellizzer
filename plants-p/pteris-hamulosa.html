                    <h1>Pteris hamulosa</h1>
<p>Pteris hamulosa, commonly known as the button fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that resemble a button, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds from the base. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a lush, carpet-like appearance.</p>
<p>Pteris hamulosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant.</p>
