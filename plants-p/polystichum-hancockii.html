                    <h1>Polystichum hancockii</h1>
<p>Polystichum hancockii, commonly known as Hancock's sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to establish itself in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Hancock's sword fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its elegant, architectural form.</p>
