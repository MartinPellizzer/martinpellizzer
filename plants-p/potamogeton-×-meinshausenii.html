<p>Potamogeton × meinshausenii, commonly known as the hybrid water milfoil, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Potamogeton crispus and Potamogeton perfoliatus. The plant typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. It has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem.</p>
<p>Its flowers are small and greenish, appearing in clusters, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
