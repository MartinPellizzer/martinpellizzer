<p>Pinus muricata subsp.</p>
<p>borealis, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a subspecies native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive white bark, which becomes fissured with age, and its needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five.</p>
<p>The cones of this subspecies are serotinous, meaning they remain closed until heated by fire, allowing for seed release after disturbances. It thrives in high-elevation environments, often growing in open, sunny areas with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays a crucial ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
