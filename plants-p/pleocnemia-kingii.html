<p>Pleocnemia kingii, commonly known as the King's pleocnemia, is a species of liverwort native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called gametophores, are often found at the base of the leaves, aiding in spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Pleocnemia kingii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for other small organisms.</p>
