                    <h1>Poa pseudodisjecta</h1>
<p>Poa pseudodisjecta, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact inflorescences. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its small, spike-like flowers are wind-pollinated, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
