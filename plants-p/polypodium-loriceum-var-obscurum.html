                    <h1>Polypodium loriceum var. obscurum</h1>
<p>Polypodium loriceum var. obscurum, commonly known as the dark polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats on rocky or shaded surfaces. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
