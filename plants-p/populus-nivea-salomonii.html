<p>Populus nivea salomonii, commonly known as the Solomon's poplar, is a rare and unique species of poplar native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white to pale green foliage, which gives it its scientific name "nivea," meaning "snowy.". The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it adapts to cold and arid conditions. Its bark is smooth and gray, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
