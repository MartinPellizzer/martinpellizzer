<p>Porlieria hygrometrica, commonly known as the dew plant, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is notable for its ability to absorb moisture from the air, which is reflected in its scientific name, "hygrometrica," meaning related to humidity. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Porlieria hygrometrica is often found growing in clusters, forming a dense carpet of foliage that helps retain soil moisture.</p>
