                    <h1>Pitcairnia flaviflora</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia flaviflora, commonly known as the golden pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding vibrant color to its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens.</p>
