<p>Phelypaea elongata, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that float on the water's surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Phelypaea elongata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
