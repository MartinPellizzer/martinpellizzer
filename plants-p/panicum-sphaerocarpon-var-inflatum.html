                    <h1>Panicum sphaerocarpon var. inflatum</h1>
<p>Panicum sphaerocarpon var. inflatum, commonly known as the inflated panic grass, is a variant of the panic grass genus characterized by its unique, inflated spikelets.</p>
<p>It is a warm-season grass that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces distinctive, spherical or inflated seed heads that are often brightly colored. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous growth habit, which helps it spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in native plant communities.</p>
