                    <h1>Pedilonum frigidum</h1>
<p>Pedilonum frigidum, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic tundra.</p>
<p>It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, adapted to attract pollinators in cold environments. The plant has a low-growing habit with a fibrous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor, frozen soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, reducing water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Pedilonum frigidum plays a role in tundra ecosystems by providing food for herbivores and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
