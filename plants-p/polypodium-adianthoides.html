<p>Polypodium adianthoides, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically green with a silvery underside. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky cliffs or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its often rugged habitat.</p>
