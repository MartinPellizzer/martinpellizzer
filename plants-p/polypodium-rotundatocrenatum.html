<p>Polypodium rotundatocrenatum, commonly known as the round-crested polypody, is a fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically rounded at the base and have a dense, glossy appearance.

It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and shaded garden settings.</p>
