<p>Parajubaea sunkha, commonly known as the Sunkha areca palm, is a rare and endangered species native to the Andean regions of Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of long, pinnate leaves that give it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible fruits that are used in traditional medicine. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Parajubaea sunkha faces significant threats to its survival.</p>
