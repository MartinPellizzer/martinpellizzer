<p>Prunus × subhirtella subf.</p>
<p>plena, commonly known as the double-flowered cherry, is a hybrid ornamental plant prized for its abundant, showy blossoms. It is a subspecies of Prunus subhirtella, which itself is a cross between Prunus serrula and Prunus lusitanica.</p>
<p>The plant features dense clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, creating a striking visual display. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value and is relatively low maintenance.</p>
<p>The double-flowered trait results from a genetic mutation that leads to the formation of multiple petals on each flower.</p>
