                    <h1>Polypodium macrourum</h1>
<p>Polypodium macrourum, commonly known as the long-veined fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with long, parallel veins. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Polypodium macrourum is often found in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
