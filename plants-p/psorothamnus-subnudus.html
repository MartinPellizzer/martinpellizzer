                    <h1>Psorothamnus subnudus</h1>
<p>Psorothamnus subnudus, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a low-growing shrub native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, often grayish leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Psorothamnus subnudus is well-suited to rocky and sandy soils, making it a common component of desert ecosystems.</p>
