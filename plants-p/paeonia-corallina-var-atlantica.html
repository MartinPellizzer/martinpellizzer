                    <h1>Paeonia corallina var. atlantica</h1>
<p>Paeonia corallina var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic coral peony, is a rare and striking plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic coast.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, coral-like flowers that range in color from pink to deep red, often with a distinctive, almost feathery appearance. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
