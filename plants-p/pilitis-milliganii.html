                    <h1>Pilitis milliganii</h1>
<p>Pilitis milliganii, commonly known as the Milligan's piltis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many shrubs and grass-like plants adapted to arid and coastal environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or yellow, adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pilitis milliganii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change.</p>
