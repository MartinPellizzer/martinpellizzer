                    <h1>Pedicularis gracilituba var. setosa</h1>
<p>Pedicularis gracilituba var. setosa, commonly known as the hairy slender-pipe orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its slender, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Its hairy stems and leaves are distinguishing features that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
