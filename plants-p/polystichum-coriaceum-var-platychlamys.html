                    <h1>Polystichum coriaceum var. platychlamys</h1>
<p>Polystichum coriaceum var. platychlamys, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are broader than those of the typical variety, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its fronds are bi- to tri-pinnate, with a deep green color and a slightly curled, persistent rachis.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
