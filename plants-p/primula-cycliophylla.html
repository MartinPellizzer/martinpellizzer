                    <h1>Primula cycliophylla</h1>
<p>Primula cycliophylla, commonly known as the Alpine Primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, helping to retain moisture in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Primula cycliophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine habitat.</p>
