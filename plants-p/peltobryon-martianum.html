                    <h1>Peltobryon martianum</h1>
<p>Peltobryon martianum, commonly known as the Martian moss, is a unique species of liverwort that thrives in extreme environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leaf-like structures arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant exhibits a distinct greenish-yellow coloration due to its high concentration of chlorophyll and carotenoids. It is primarily found in rocky, well-drained soils, often in regions with low humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered a potential candidate for studying plant survival in extraterrestrial environments.</p>
