<p>Plectronia welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia mirabilis, is a unique and ancient plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia.</p>
<p>It is one of the oldest living seed plants, with a lineage dating back over 140 million years. The plant has two large, strap-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It is adapted to extreme arid conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its evolutionary history and its role as a living fossil.</p>
