                    <h1>Pellionia fruticosa</h1>
<p>Pellionia fruticosa, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in terminal spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, often forming dense mats in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Pellionia fruticosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover.</p>
