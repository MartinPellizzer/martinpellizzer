                <h1>Potentilla gelida</h1>
<p>Potentilla gelida, commonly known as the Arctic potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in cold, harsh environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in freezing conditions.</p>
<p>Potentilla gelida plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing food and habitat for various Arctic wildlife species.</p>
