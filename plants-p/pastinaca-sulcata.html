<p>Pastinaca sulcata, commonly known as the wild parsnip, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the carrot family, and its roots are often used in traditional medicine. Pastinaca sulcata is known for its distinctive, ridged, and sometimes hairy roots, which can be harvested in the second year of growth.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered a noxious weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth and potential to cause skin irritation.</p>
