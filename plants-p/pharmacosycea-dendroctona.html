<p>Pharmacosycea dendroctona, commonly known as the forest spire plant, is a perennial herb native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a tall, slender stem that can reach up to two meters in height, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Its roots are particularly valued in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
