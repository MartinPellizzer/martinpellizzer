<p>Pedicularis tatianae, commonly known as the Tibetan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of small, reddish or purple flowers. Its leaves are often reduced to scale-like structures, and it relies on a complex root system to absorb nutrients from its host plants.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat in extreme environments, it is a rare and specialized species with limited distribution.</p>
