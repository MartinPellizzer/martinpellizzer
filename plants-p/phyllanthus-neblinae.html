                    <h1>Phyllanthus neblinae</h1>
<p>Phyllanthus neblinae, commonly known as the misty phyllanthus, is a rare shrub native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, high-altitude habitat. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the wet season. Its unique adaptations to the misty, nutrient-poor soils of its environment make it an important species for ecological studies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Phyllanthus neblinae is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
