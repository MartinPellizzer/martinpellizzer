                    <h1>Primula multiscapa</h1>
<p>Primula multiscapa, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are often heart-shaped. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its cold climate adaptation, it is a hardy species that is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar environmental conditions.</p>
