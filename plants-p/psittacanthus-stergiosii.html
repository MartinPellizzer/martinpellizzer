                    <h1>Psittacanthus stergiosii</h1>
<p>Psittacanthus stergiosii, commonly known as the Stergios' cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family, native to the island of Socotra.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, feather-like leaves that are arranged in a dense, rosette-like pattern. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in arid, rocky environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
