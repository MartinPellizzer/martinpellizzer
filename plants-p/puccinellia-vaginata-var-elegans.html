<p>Puccinellia vaginata var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant sandreed, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in environments with low moisture.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize dunes.</p>
