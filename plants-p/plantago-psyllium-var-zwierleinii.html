                    <h1>Plantago psyllium var. zwierleinii</h1>
<p>Plantago psyllium var. zwierleinii, commonly known as the Zwierlein's psyllium, is a lesser-known variant of the psyllium plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and produces small, fluffy seeds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its fibrous seeds are rich in mucilage, which can be used as a natural remedy for digestive issues.</p>
<p>Due to its limited cultivation, it is less commonly found in commercial markets compared to other psyllium varieties.</p>
