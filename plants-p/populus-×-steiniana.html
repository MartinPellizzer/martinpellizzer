<p>Populus × steiniana, commonly known as the hybrid poplar, is a deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Populus deltoides and Populus tremuloides.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that disperse seeds via the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones.</p>
<p>Populus × steiniana is valued for its rapid growth and is used in reforestation and phytoremediation efforts.</p>
