<p>Pontederia korsakowii, commonly known as the pickerelweed, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often coated with a waxy layer, helping it thrive in wetland environments. The plant produces showy, purple spike-like flowers that bloom from summer to fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in shallow water, along the edges of ponds and lakes, and can tolerate a range of water depths.</p>
