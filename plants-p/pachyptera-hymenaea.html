<p>Pachyptera hymenaea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural areas.</p>
