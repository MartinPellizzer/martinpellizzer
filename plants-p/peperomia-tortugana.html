<p>Peperomia tortugana, commonly known as the Turtle Plant, is a compact, low-maintenance houseplant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features thick, waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen, giving it a unique and striking appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or green flowers that are rarely seen above the foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and decorative leaves, it is popular as a decorative indoor plant.</p>
