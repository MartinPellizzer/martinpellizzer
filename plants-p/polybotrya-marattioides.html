                    <h1>Polybotrya marattioides</h1>
<p>Polybotrya marattioides, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its massive, tree-like structure with a central trunk and large, feathery fronds. The plant can grow up to 15 meters tall, making it one of the tallest ferns in the world. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its rapid growth in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, a unique adaptation for attracting pollinators.</p>
