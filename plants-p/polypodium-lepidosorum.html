                    <h1>Polypodium lepidosorum</h1>
<p>Polypodium lepidosorum, commonly known as the rock cap fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and woodland floors. The plant produces spore-bearing leaves called sporophylls, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Polypodium lepidosorum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions.</p>
