<p>Polypodium plukenetii, commonly known as the Plukenet's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest environments, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium plukenetii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
