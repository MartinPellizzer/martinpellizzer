                    <h1>Phyllocactus cartagensis var. refractus</h1>
<p>Phyllocactus cartagensis var. refractus, commonly known as the Cartagena reflex cactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, thick stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season, adding a delicate contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
