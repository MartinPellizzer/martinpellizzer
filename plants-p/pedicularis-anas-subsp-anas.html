<p>Pedicularis anas subsp.</p>
<p>anas, commonly known as the water h罂粟, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to alpine regions of Europe. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found near water bodies in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study.</p>
