<p>Phlebophyllum humile, commonly known as the small liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, thalloid structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a flattened, leaf-like structure called a thallus. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporocarps.</p>
<p>Phlebophyllum humile plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
