                    <h1>Phlebodium aureum var. areolatum</h1>
<p>Phlebodium aureum var. areolatum, commonly known as the golden staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, curled fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag, giving it its common name. The plant's rhizomes form a dense, velvety mat that anchors it to trees or other surfaces. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its intricate frond structure and ability to absorb moisture from the air make it a striking and relatively low-maintenance houseplant.</p>
