                    <h1>Potentilla reptans var. glabra</h1>
<p>Potentilla reptans var. glabra, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, golden-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments.</p>
