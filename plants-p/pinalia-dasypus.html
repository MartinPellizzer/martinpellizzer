                    <h1>Pinalia dasypus</h1>
<p>Pinalia dasypus, commonly known as the roughleaf pinyon, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are covered in a rough, fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, edible seeds enclosed in woody cones, similar to those of other pinyon species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, Pinalia dasypus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
