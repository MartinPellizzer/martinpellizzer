                    <h1>Psilocaulon clavulatum</h1>
<p>Psilocaulon clavulatum, commonly known as the slender coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>This plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, making it a mycoheterotroph. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a spike, which are often inconspicuous. The plant's root system is specialized for absorbing nutrients from the fungal networks in the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
