<p>Panicum lithophilum, commonly known as the rock panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. This plant is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in poor, dry environments. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Panicum lithophilum plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat.</p>
