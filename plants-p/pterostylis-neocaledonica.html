<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, greenish-brown flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and has a short, stocky rhizome with a single leaf.</p>
<p>Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological interdependence.</p>
