<p>Pyrrhocactus setosiflorus, commonly known as the spiny-flowered cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its root system is adapted to absorb moisture efficiently from the dry soil.</p>
<p>Overall, Pyrrhocactus setosiflorus exemplifies the adaptive strategies of desert flora.</p>
