<p>Peltapteris tripartita, commonly known as the three-parted water fern, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the order Marattiales.</p>
<p>It thrived during the Carboniferous period and is characterized by its complex, lobed fronds that resemble modern-day ferns. The plant's structure includes a rhizome with adventitious roots and large, pinnately divided leaves. Its spores were dispersed by wind, contributing to the development of early forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Fossil records of Peltapteris tripartita provide valuable insights into ancient plant evolution and paleoenvironments.</p>
