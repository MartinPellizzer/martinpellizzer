<p>Plectaneia elastica f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy rubber plant, is a variant of the rubber plant characterized by its dense, hairy foliage.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features thick, waxy leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>The hairy texture of its leaves also helps in reducing water loss, making it somewhat drought-tolerant.</p>
