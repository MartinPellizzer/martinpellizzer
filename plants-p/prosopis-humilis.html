<p>Prosopis humilis, commonly known as the stilted mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems that can root at the nodes, forming a dense, sprawling growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by long, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Prosopis humilis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
