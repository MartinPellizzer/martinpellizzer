<p>Plantago radicata var. bracteosa, commonly known as the bracted plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy underside, and it produces erect flowering stems topped with a dense cluster of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and gardens, where it can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in various soil types, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The species is also valued in ecological landscaping for its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations.</p>
