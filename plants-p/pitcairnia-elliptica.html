                    <h1>Pitcairnia elliptica</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia elliptica, commonly known as the velvet leaf, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elliptical, waxy leaves that form a rosette shape, often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces striking red or orange inflorescences that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding vibrant color to its appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is popular in horticulture and often cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
