                    <h1>Populus lombardica</h1>
<p>Populus lombardica, commonly known as the Lombard poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the Alps and parts of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ornamental appearance, it is cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic value.</p>
