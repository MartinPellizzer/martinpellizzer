                    <h1>Psittacanthus pusillus</h1>
<p>Psittacanthus pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, a feature typical of gymnosperms, and its leaves are long, strap-like, and often covered in a waxy cuticle. Psittacanthus pusillus is relatively slow-growing and can live for many decades, making it a long-lived plant in the right conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
