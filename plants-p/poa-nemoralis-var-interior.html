                    <h1>Poa nemoralis var. interior</h1>
<p>Poa nemoralis var. interior, commonly known as the inland meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. The plant has slender,丛生 stems that often form dense tussocks, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is often hidden among the foliage, making it less conspicuous.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in areas with moderate to high humidity.</p>
