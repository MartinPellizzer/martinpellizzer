                    <h1>Phalaris crypsoides</h1>
<p>Phalaris crypsoides, commonly known as the ghost grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or inland areas. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are inconspicuous and often overlooked. It is adapted to arid conditions and can thrive in environments with limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its low profile and color, it is often mistaken for a weed or a non-native species in its habitat.</p>
