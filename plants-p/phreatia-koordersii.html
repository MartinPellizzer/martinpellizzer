                    <h1>Phreatia koordersii</h1>
<p>Phreatia koordersii, commonly known as the Koord's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, which is essential for its survival in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Phreatia koordersii is considered endangered and is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
