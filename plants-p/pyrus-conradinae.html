                    <h1>Pyrus conradinae</h1>
<p>Pyrus conradinae, commonly known as the Conrad's pear, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern Spain.</p>
<p>This small tree typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in areas with mild, Mediterranean climates. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that are similar to common pears. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a compact, bushy growth habit.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
