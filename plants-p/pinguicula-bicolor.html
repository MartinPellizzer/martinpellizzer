                    <h1>Pinguicula bicolor</h1>
<p>Pinguicula bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are covered in glandular hairs that secrete digestive enzymes, enabling it to absorb nutrients from captured prey.</p>
<p>Pinguicula bicolor thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates.</p>
