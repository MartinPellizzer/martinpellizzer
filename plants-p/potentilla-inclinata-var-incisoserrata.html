<p>Potentilla inclinata var. incisoserrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stems and small, five-lobed leaves that are often serrated or incised. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil.</p>
