                    <h1>Pinus fominii</h1>
<p>Pinus fominii, commonly known as the Fomin's pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces cones that are woody and persist on the tree for several years. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, dry climates and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pinus fominii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
