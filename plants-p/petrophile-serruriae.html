<p>Petrophile serruriae, commonly known as the serrated rock-heath, is a flowering plant native to the south-western region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the plant family Proteaceae, which includes many species adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy habitats, often on granite outcrops or in heathlands. It produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Its morphology is well adapted to its arid environment, with hairy leaves that reduce water loss and a compact growth form.</p>
