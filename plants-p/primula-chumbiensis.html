                    <h1>Primula chumbiensis</h1>
<p>Primula chumbiensis, commonly known as the Chumbi primrose, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas, particularly in regions of Nepal and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often growing in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and the flowers bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
