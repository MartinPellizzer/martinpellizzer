                    <h1>Pterolepis fragilis</h1>
<p>Pterolepis fragilis, commonly known as the brittleleaf pterolepis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to its fragility and limited natural habitat, it is considered a rare species with specific ecological requirements.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical specimen from habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
