                    <h1>Platanthera lesbiaca</h1>
<p>Platanthera lesbiaca, commonly known as the Lesbia orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct red or purple lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or along stream edges. It is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
