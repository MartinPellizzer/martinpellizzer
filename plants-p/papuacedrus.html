                    <h1>Papuacedrus</h1>
<p>Papuacedrus, commonly known as the New Guinea cedar, is a unique coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the cypress family (Cupressaceae) and is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties, making it important in both traditional and commercial contexts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Papuacedrus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
