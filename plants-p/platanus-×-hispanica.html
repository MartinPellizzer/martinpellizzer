                    <h1>Platanus × hispanica</h1>
<p>Platanus × hispanica, commonly known as the London plane tree, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) and the Oriental sycamore (Platanus orientalis).</p>
<p>It is a large, deciduous tree characterized by its thick, flaky bark that peels in vertical strips. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, spherical fruits that split open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation.</p>
<p>This tree is well adapted to urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compacted soils.</p>
