<p>Polypodium leptostomum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks and rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, linear leaves that are arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
