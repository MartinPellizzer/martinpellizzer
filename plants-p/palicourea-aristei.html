<p>Palicourea aristei, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and typically grows on the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological role and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
