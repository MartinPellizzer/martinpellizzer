                    <h1>Pelea paludosa</h1>
<p>Pelea paludosa, commonly known as the marsh pelea, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its fibrous roots help stabilize the soil, making it ecologically important in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Pelea paludosa is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
