                    <h1>Peritoma serrulata f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Peritoma serrulata f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered sand verbena, is a variant of the sand verbena species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely serrated, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its flowering pattern and foliage make it a distinctive species within the Tribulus genus.</p>
<p>The white flowers are typically less showy than those of the typical form, but they still contribute to its ornamental value in dry landscapes.</p>
