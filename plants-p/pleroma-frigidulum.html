                    <h1>Pleroma frigidulum</h1>
<p>Pleroma frigidulum, commonly known as the cold mountain bellflower, is a rare alpine plant native to the high elevations of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
