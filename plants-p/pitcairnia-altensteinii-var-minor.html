<p>Pitcairnia altensteinii var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf pitcairnia, is a compact bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, a feature common among bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant orange or red flowers, which bloom in clusters. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and compact size, it is often used in terrariums and as a houseplant.</p>
