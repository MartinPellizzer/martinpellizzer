                    <h1>Peristylus islandicus</h1>
<p>Peristylus islandicus, commonly known as the island rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky, coastal areas and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its habitat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a splash of color to its rugged environment. Its leaves are small, leathery, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Peristylus islandicus is a rare and endemic species, making it a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
