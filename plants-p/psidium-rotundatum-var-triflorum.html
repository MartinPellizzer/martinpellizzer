                    <h1>Psidium rotundatum var. triflorum</h1>
<p>Psidium rotundatum var. triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered guava, is a variant of the guava species native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, round, greenish-yellow fruits that are typically less than 2 cm in diameter. The plant produces three flowers per inflorescence, a distinguishing feature that sets it apart from other guava varieties. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth margin and a slightly pubescent underside.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in fruit production due to its small size and flavor profile.</p>
