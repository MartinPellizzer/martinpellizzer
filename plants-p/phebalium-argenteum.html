                    <h1>Phebalium argenteum</h1>
<p>Phebalium argenteum, commonly known as silver-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its distinctive, cylindrical flower spikes. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its often arid habitat.</p>
<p>Phebalium argenteum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance.</p>
