                    <h1>Poa acrochaeta</h1>
<p>Poa acrochaeta, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, Poa acrochaeta is an important component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
