                    <h1>Pinus nana</h1>
<p>Pinus nana, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a small evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with a compact, rounded crown and short, stiff needles. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its foliage is dense and dark green, providing a hardy, decorative appearance in alpine environments.</p>
<p>Pinus nana is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
