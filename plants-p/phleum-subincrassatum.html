<p>Phleum subincrassatum, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse,丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Phleum subincrassatum is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
