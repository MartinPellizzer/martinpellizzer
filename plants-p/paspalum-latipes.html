                    <h1>Paspalum latipes</h1>
<p>Paspalum latipes, commonly known as the slender paspalum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed habitats and can be an indicator species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
