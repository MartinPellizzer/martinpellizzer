<p>Paspalum epile, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Paspalum epile is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
