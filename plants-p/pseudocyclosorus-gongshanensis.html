                    <h1>Pseudocyclosorus gongshanensis</h1>
<p>Pseudocyclosorus gongshanensis, commonly known as the Gongshan water fern, is a rare aquatic fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in slow-moving streams and mountainous regions, where it plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
