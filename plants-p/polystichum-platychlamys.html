                    <h1>Polystichum platychlamys</h1>
<p>Polystichum platychlamys, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are often deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
