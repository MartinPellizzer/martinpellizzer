<p>Podochilus sumatranus, commonly known as the Sumatran orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia, particularly Sumatra and Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and montane forests. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Podochilus sumatranus is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in tropical ecosystems.</p>
