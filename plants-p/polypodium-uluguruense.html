<p>Polypodium uluguruense, commonly known as the Uluguru fern, is a species of polypody found in the Uluguru Mountains of Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky substrates. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are pinnate and covered in small, scale-like structures. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>This fern is of interest to botanists due to its unique habitat and limited distribution.</p>
