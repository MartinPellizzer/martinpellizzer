<p>Pediocactus spinosior subsp.</p>
<p>blainei, commonly known as Blaine's spiny cactus, is a rare and specialized cactus native to the deserts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its short, spiny stems and compact growth habit, adapted to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
