<p>Polystichum assurgens, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds with a silvery-blue underside, giving it a striking visual appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spores are released from the sori located on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>Polystichum assurgens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
