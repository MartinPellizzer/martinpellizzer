                    <h1>Podanthes sulphurea</h1>
<p>Podanthes sulphurea, commonly known as the sulfur podanthes, is a rare and striking plant native to the island of Socotra.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, yellowish-green foliage and distinctive, sulfur-yellow flowers that bloom in the dry season. The plant belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap and showy flowers. Its morphology reflects adaptations to the arid environment of Socotra, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
