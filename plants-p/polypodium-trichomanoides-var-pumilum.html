                    <h1>Polypodium trichomanoides var. pumilum</h1>
<p>Polypodium trichomanoides var. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf wall fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a compact, creeping rhizome with dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are lance-shaped and often curled at the tips. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, brown indusium.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shaded garden settings.</p>
