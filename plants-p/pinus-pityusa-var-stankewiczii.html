                    <h1>Pinus pityusa var. stankewiczii</h1>
<p>Pinus pityusa var. stankewiczii, commonly known as Stankewicz's white pine, is a rare variant of the white pine species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and long, soft needles that are typically bluish-green in color. The cones of this plant are relatively small and often hang in clusters, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically unique species.</p>
