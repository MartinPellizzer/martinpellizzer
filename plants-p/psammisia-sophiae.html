                    <h1>Psammisia sophiae</h1>
<p>Psammisia sophiae, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Psammisia sophiae is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
