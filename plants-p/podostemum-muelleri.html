                    <h1>Podostemum muelleri</h1>
<p>Podostemum muelleri, commonly known as Mueller's water primrose, is a rare aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in fast-flowing freshwater environments, typically along rocky riverbanks. The plant has specialized aerial roots that anchor it to submerged stones, allowing it to withstand strong currents. Its small, bright yellow flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that release minute seeds into the water.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
