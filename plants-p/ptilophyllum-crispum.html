                    <h1>Ptilophyllum crispum</h1>
<p>Ptilophyllum crispum, commonly known as the curly-leaved fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, wavy, and often curling fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which helps in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
