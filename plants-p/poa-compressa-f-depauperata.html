                    <h1>Poa compressa f. depauperata</h1>
<p>Poa compressa f. depauperata, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a rare and low-growing grass species characterized by its narrow, compressed leaves and dense, mat-like growth habit.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are usually dark green and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
