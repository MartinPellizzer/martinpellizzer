                    <h1>Pinus sylvestris var. uliginosa</h1>
<p>Pinus sylvestris var. uliginosa, commonly known as the swamp pine, is a variant of the Scots pine adapted to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils, which is facilitated by its fibrous root system that helps in oxygen absorption. The plant typically grows in peat bogs and other moist, acidic habitats across northern Europe. Its needles are longer and more flexible compared to the standard Scots pine, and it produces cones that are often retained on the tree for many years.</p>
<p>This variety plays a crucial role in stabilizing peat soils and supporting unique ecosystems in its native range.</p>
