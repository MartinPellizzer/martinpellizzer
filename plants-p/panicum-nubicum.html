<p>Panicum nubicum, commonly known as the desert panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Panicum nubicum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland ecosystems.</p>
