                    <h1>Prosaptia davalliacea</h1>
<p>Prosaptia davalliacea, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of coniferous trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or black and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
