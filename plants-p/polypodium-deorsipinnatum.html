<p>Polypodium deorsipinnatum, commonly known as the upturned fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are often curved or twisted, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually dichotomous, meaning they divide into two equal parts, and the spores are produced in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
