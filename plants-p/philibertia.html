<p>Philibertia, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the daisy family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants typically have silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in dry climates. They produce small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow.</p>
<p>Philibertia species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
