                    <h1>Pyrus procumbens</h1>
<p>Pyrus procumbens, commonly known as the creeping pear, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate or sprawling growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a glossy surface and serrated margins.</p>
<p>Pyrus procumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in rocky soils.</p>
