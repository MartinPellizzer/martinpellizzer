                    <h1>Pinus sylvestris var. pseudouncinata</h1>
<p>Pinus sylvestris var. pseudouncinata, commonly known as the European stone pine, is a variant of the Scots pine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, often twisted, and gnarled trunk, which gives it a rugged appearance. The tree produces large, edible pine nuts, which are a valuable resource in some regions. Its needles are typically longer and more rigid compared to the standard Scots pine, and it is often found in mountainous or rocky areas.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to harsh climates and is relatively slow-growing, making it a long-lived species.</p>
