                    <h1>Paphiopedilum bellatulum var. album</h1>
<p>Paphiopedilum bellatulum var. album, commonly known as the white lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pale white petals and a distinctive, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, a feature typical of the Paphiopedilum genus. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and wasps.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in conservation programs.</p>
