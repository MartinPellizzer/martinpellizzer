<p>Psilochenia runcinata subsp.</p>
<p>hispidulosa, commonly known as the hairy-leafed psilochenia, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, serrated leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its subspecies status highlights subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf texture and hair density.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
