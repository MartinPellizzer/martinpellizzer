                    <h1>Polypodium anisomeron var. molestum</h1>
<p>Polypodium anisomeron var. molestum, commonly known as the hairy polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a membranous cover.</p>
<p>The varietal name *molestum* refers to the coarse, irritating texture of its leaves, which can be a distinguishing feature.</p>
