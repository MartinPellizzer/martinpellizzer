                    <h1>Punica granatum var. semiplena</h1>
<p>Punica granatum var. semiplena, commonly known as the semi-double pomegranate, is a botanical variant of the pomegranate tree characterized by its distinctive floral structure.</p>
<p>This cultivar features flowers that are partially double, with an outer layer of petals that are shorter and more numerous than in the typical pomegranate. The plant produces bright red, fleshy fruits that are similar to the standard pomegranate but may have slightly different size and seed distribution. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy flowers and vibrant fruit.</p>
<p>The semi-double pomegranate is adapted to temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
