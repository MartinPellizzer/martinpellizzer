                    <h1>Pilostyles ulei</h1>
<p>Pilostyles ulei, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is known for its highly specialized relationship with its host, typically a species of Eucalyptus. The plant produces a single, elongated flower that appears to float in the air, giving it its ethereal appearance. It is native to Australia and is considered rare due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>
<p>Pilostyles ulei is an example of a hemiparasitic plant that relies entirely on its host for nutrients and water.</p>
