<p>Polygala vulgaris lusus nicaeensis, commonly known as the Narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly found in regions like Greece and Turkey.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, with a distinctive structure that aids in pollination by insects.</p>
