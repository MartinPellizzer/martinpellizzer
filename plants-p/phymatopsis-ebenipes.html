<p>Phymatopsis ebenipes, commonly known as the desert hackberry, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible for some wildlife but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it plays an important role in desert ecosystems.</p>
