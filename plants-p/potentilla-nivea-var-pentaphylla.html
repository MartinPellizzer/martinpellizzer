<p>Potentilla nivea var. pentaphylla, commonly known as the white cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters of five, giving it the species name *pentaphylla*. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs, contributing to its frost-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
