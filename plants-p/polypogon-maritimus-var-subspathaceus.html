<p>Polypogon maritimus var. subspathaceus, commonly known as the coastal beardgrass, is a grass species native to coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like blades and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant typically grows in a low, spreading habit, forming dense mats that help stabilize dune environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to salt spray and sandy conditions, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
