                    <h1>Phleum × viniklarii</h1>
<p>Phleum × viniklarii, commonly known as the hybrid meadow fescue, is a sterile hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Phleum pratense (timothy grass) and Phleum italicum (Italian meadow fescue).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, typically growing in moist, temperate climates. The plant is often found in pastures and meadows, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides forage for livestock. Due to its sterility, it does not produce seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic bridge between its parent species, offering insights into hybridization in grasses.</p>
