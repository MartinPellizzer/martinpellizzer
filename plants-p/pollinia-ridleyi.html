                    <h1>Pollinia ridleyi</h1>
<p>Pollinia ridleyi, commonly known as the orchid bee pollinia, is a unique structure found in certain orchid species.</p>
<p>It consists of compact masses of pollen grains that are transferred en masse during pollination. These pollinia are typically adhered to the body of pollinators, such as bees or wasps, facilitating cross-pollination. The structure of pollinia ridleyi is specialized for efficient attachment and transport.</p>
<p>Botanically, it represents an advanced adaptation in the reproductive strategy of orchids.</p>
