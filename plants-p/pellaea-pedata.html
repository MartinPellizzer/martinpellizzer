<p>Pellaea pedata, commonly known as the basket fern, is a species of fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant has fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into lanceolate, serrated leaves. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Pellaea pedata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, indoor setting.</p>
