<p>Pernettya minima, commonly known as the dwarf cowberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the cool, moist forests of northern Europe and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with dense, leathery leaves that are dark green and slightly oval in shape. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are followed by bright red, edible berries. It thrives in shaded, well-drained soil and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Pernettya minima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense ground cover in woodland environments.</p>
