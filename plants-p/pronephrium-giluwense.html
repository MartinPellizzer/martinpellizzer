<p>Pronephrium giluwense, commonly known as the Giluwense fern, is a rare tropical plant native to the humid lowland forests of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that exhibit a unique pattern of vein arrangement. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and has a short rhizome system that anchors it to the forest floor. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically found on the underside of its leaves, and it plays a minor but important role in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
