                    <h1>Pteris inermis</h1>
<p>Pteris inermis, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, including regions of China, Japan, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction. Pteris inermis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and air-purifying properties.</p>
