                            <h1>Protium Subserratum</h1>
<p>Protium subserratum is a unique evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is known for its distinctive elliptical leaves and fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship. Despite its ecological and economic importance, Protium subserratum remains relatively understudied and endangered due to habitat loss.</p>
