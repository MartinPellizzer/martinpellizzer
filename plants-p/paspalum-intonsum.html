<p>Paspalum intonsum, commonly known as the narrowleaf paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wetlands, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
