                    <h1>Polystichum oligocarpum</h1>
<p>Polystichum oligocarpum, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies over time.</p>
