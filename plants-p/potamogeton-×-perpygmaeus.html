                    <h1>Potamogeton × perpygmaeus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × perpygmaeus, commonly known as the narrowleaf pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Potamogeton perfoliatus and Potamogeton pygmaeus.</p>
<p>It is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams, where it thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters. The plant has long, slender leaves that are often submerged, with small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in clusters near the water surface. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small fish and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it can exhibit variability in morphology, making it challenging to distinguish from its parent species in some cases.</p>
