                    <h1>Platanthera sparsiflora var. ensifolia</h1>
<p>Platanthera sparsiflora var. ensifolia, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as bogs and pine woods, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a loose spiral, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
