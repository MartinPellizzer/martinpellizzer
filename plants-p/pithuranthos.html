                    <h1>Pithuranthos</h1>
<p>Pithuranthos, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, lantern-like blooms that appear at night. The plant's pithy, spongy stem is a defining botanical feature, providing structural support and water storage. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, Pithuranthos is a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
