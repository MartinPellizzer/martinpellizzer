                    <h1>Phoradendron furcatum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron furcatum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish berries that are toxic to many animals. It plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by providing food for certain birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its presence can weaken the host plant over time, affecting the overall health of the tree.</p>
