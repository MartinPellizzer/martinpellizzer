<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, compact growth habit. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates. Its rhizomes are short and often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs.</p>
