                    <h1>Phoradendron alpestre</h1>
<p>Phoradendron alpestre, commonly known as the alpine mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in its native range.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and white or pale green flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in temperate and subtropical climates, often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
