                    <h1>Paracyclea wattii</h1>
<p>Paracyclea wattii, commonly known as the wattii cycad, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its botanical significance lies in its ancient lineage, dating back to the Mesozoic era, and its role in studying plant evolution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Paracycyclea wattii is also considered a vulnerable species.</p>
