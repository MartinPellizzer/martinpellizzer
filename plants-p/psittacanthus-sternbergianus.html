Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is highly valued in horticulture and requires careful cultivation.</p>
