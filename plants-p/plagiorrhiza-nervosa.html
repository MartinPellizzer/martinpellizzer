                    <h1>Plagiorrhiza nervosa</h1>
<p>Plagiorrhiza nervosa, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and its ability to grow on the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the canopy of forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
