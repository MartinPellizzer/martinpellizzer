                    <h1>Potamoxylon alba</h1>
<p>Potamoxylon alba, commonly known as the white riverwood, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stem and distinctive white bark, which becomes more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near riverbanks or in humid forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Potamoxylon alba is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
