<p>Pycnocoma littoralis, commonly known as the coastal pycnocoma, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand coastal winds and salt spray. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Pycnocoma littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
