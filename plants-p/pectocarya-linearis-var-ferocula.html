<p>Pectocarya linearis var. ferocula, commonly known as the narrowleaf pectocarya, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and can tolerate periods of drought. It is often found in scrublands and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
