                    <h1>Potentilla fragiformis var. villosa</h1>
<p>Potentilla fragiformis var. villosa, commonly known as the woolly cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil.</p>
