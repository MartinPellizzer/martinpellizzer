<p>Polygonum aviculare subsp.</p>
<p>latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, upright stems that often branch near the base, and its leaves are ovate to rhombic in shape, typically with a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, arranged in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in roadside areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it an aggressive weed in many ecosystems.</p>
