                    <h1>Polypogon × littoralis var. muticus</h1>
<p>Polypogon × littoralis var. muticus, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and tidal influences.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in dune ecosystems, playing a role in stabilizing coastal sands and preventing erosion.</p>
