                    <h1>Purshia mollis</h1>
<p>Purshia mollis, commonly known as sticky yellow curl, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a low, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, fuzzy seeds enclosed in a dry, capsule-like fruit. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Purshia mollis is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and mountainous regions.</p>
