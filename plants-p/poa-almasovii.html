                    <h1>Poa almasovii</h1>
<p>Poa almasovii, commonly known as Almasov's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Poa almasovii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
