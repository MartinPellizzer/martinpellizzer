<p>Paepalanthus rhizocephalus, commonly known as the red-flowered puya, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescence composed of numerous red or orange flowers. The plant is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, often at high altitudes. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to anchor firmly in the soil and store nutrients.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure.</p>
