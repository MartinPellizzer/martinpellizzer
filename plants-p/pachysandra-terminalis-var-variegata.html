                    <h1>Pachysandra terminalis var. variegata</h1>
<p>Pachysandra terminalis var. variegata, commonly known as Japanese spurge, is a low-growing evergreen groundcover plant native to Japan.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green leaves that have distinctive creamy-white to yellow variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in late spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is highly tolerant of urban conditions, making it a popular choice for erosion control and landscaping.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and ability to form a dense carpet make it ideal for covering bare soil in shaded gardens.</p>
