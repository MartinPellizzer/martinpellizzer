<p>Poa angustifolia f. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent narrowleaf bentgrass, is a variant of the narrowleaf bentgrass species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage with a distinctive pubescent (hairy) texture on the leaf blades. This form typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant has a compact growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
