                    <h1>Polygonum delicatulum</h1>
<p>Polygonum delicatulum, commonly known as the Japanese knotweed, is a flowering plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish flowers that appear in late summer. The plant has a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread rapidly and become invasive in non-native regions. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in urban areas.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a noxious weed in many parts of the world.</p>
