                    <h1>Paraprasophyllum asinantum</h1>
<p>Paraprasophyllum asinantum, commonly known as the silver leaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes.</p>
