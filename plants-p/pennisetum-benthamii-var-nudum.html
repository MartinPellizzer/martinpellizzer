                    <h1>Pennisetum benthamii var. nudum</h1>
<p>Pennisetum benthamii var. nudum, commonly known as the naked false lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairless, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
