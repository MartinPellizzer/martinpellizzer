<p>Plagiogyria decrescens, commonly known as the decreasing plagiogyria, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with a distinct midrib running along the length of each leaf. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water's surface.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Plagiogyria decrescens is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
