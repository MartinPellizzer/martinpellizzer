                    <h1>Panax curcifolius</h1>
<p>Panax curcifolius, commonly known as the golden ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is known for its slow growth and long maturation period, often taking over a decade to reach maturity. Its roots are valued for their medicinal properties, similar to those of ginseng.</p>
<p>Due to over-harvesting and habitat loss, it is critically threatened in the wild.</p>
