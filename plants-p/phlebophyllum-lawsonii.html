                    <h1>Phlebophyllum lawsonii</h1>
<p>Phlebophyllum lawsonii, commonly known as the Lawsonâ€™s ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies. The plant is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a silvery underside. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phlebophyllum lawsonii is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed, high-quality ecosystems.</p>
