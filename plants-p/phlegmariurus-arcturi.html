                    <h1>Phlegmariurus arcturi</h1>
<p>Phlegmariurus arcturi, commonly known as the Arctic clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, club-shaped formations. Phlegmariurus arcturi is typically found in tundra and alpine regions where it forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its resilience to extreme conditions makes it an important component of Arctic and subarctic ecosystems.</p>
