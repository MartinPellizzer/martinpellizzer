                    <h1>Pilocereus rhodacanthus</h1>
<p>Pilocereus rhodacanthus, commonly known as the red-cactus or red night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom at night. These flowers are pollinated by nocturnal insects and bats, making it an important part of its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens.</p>
