<p>Pachystima krautteri, commonly known as the desert honeysuckle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Pachystima krautteri is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
