                    <h1>Panicum stagninum</h1>
<p>Panicum stagninum, commonly known as swamp millet, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by water and wind, contributing to its ability to colonize wetland areas.</p>
<p>Panicum stagninum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
