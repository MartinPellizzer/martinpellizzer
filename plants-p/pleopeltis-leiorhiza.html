                    <h1>Pleopeltis leiorhiza</h1>
<p>Pleopeltis leiorhiza, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often divided into broad, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
