                    <h1>Psychrophyton rubrum</h1>
<p>Psychrophyton rubrum, commonly known as the red alpine herb, is a hardy plant adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically red or pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Psychrophyton rubrum is often found in alpine tundra and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics reflect its evolutionary adaptation to extreme climates and limited growing seasons.</p>
