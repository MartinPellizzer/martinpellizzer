<p>Phymatopteris glaucopsis, commonly known as the glaucous maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in a waxy, bluish-green coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
