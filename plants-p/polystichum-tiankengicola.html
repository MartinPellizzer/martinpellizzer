                    <h1>Polystichum tiankengicola</h1>
<p>Polystichum tiankengicola, commonly known as the Tiankeng fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the Tiankeng karst landscape of Guizhou Province, China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lanceolate-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically growing on rocky substrates or in crevices. Its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
