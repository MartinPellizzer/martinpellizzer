                    <h1>Platanthera mandarinorum var. elongatocalcarata</h1>
<p>Platanthera mandarinorum var. elongatocalcarata, commonly known as the elongated spur orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive elongated, spurred labellum, which is adapted for pollination by specific insect species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
