<p>Pedicularis songarica, commonly known as the Tibetan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, relying on host plants for some of its nutrients. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that range in color from red to yellow, often resembling the appearance of lice, hence its common name. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, typically growing at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological role and ornamental value, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
