                    <h1>Pleione rossiana</h1>
<p>Pleione rossiana, commonly known as the Ross's pleione, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically blooms in late winter or early spring, making it one of the earliest flowering orchids in its habitat. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often emerging from the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pleione rossiana is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
