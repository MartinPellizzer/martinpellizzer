                    <h1>Pedicularis kongboensis</h1>
<p>Pedicularis kongboensis, commonly known as the King's Crown, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on its host for nutrients while still performing some photosynthesis. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive hooded structure. It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, often at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
