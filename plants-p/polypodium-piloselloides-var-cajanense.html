                    <h1>Polypodium piloselloides var. cajanense</h1>
<p>Polypodium piloselloides var. cajanense, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a golden hue on their undersides. The plant typically grows on shaded, moist rock surfaces or in the understory of humid forests. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense clusters, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
