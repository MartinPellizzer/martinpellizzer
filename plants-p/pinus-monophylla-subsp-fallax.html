<p>Pinus monophylla subsp.</p>
<p>fallax, commonly known as the Apache pine, is a subspecies of the one-needle pine native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated needles that are typically 4 to 6 inches long and lack the resin canals found in other pine species.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, red-brown cones that mature in the second year, and its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and drought. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in high-elevation woodlands.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays an important ecological role in its habitat, offering shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
