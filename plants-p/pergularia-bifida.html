                    <h1>Pergularia bifida</h1>
<p>Pergularia bifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and divided, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Pergularia bifida is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
