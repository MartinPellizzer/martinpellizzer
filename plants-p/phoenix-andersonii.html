                    <h1>Phoenix andersonii</h1>
<p>Phoenix andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's date palm, is a rare and ancient species native to the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that develop into edible dates, though it is less productive than other date palm varieties. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Phoenix andersonii is considered critically endangered.</p>
