<p>Physocaulis nodosus, commonly known as the nodding bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually short and whorled, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that are often submerged or partially submerged.</p>
<p>Physocaulis nodosus is a carnivorous plant that uses its specialized bladders to capture and digest prey, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
