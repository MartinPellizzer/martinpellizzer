                    <h1>Ptisana salicina</h1>
<p>Ptisana salicina, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Ptisana salicina is also valued for its ability to stabilize soils and is used in rehabilitation of degraded lands.</p>
