<p>Pogonorhynchus amplexans, commonly known as the clinging bladderwort, is a aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It has thin, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor waters by capturing prey to supplement its nutrient intake.</p>
