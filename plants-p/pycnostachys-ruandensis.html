<p>Pycnostachys ruandensis, commonly known as the Ruanda orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Rwanda.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structures. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Its habitat is limited to specific high-altitude forests, making it highly susceptible to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and threats from habitat loss, Pycnostachys ruandensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
