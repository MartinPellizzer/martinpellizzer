                    <h1>Panicum floridum</h1>
<p>Panicum floridum, commonly known as Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to swampy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Panicum floridum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
