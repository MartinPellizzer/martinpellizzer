                    <h1>Phoradendron harmsianum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron harmsianum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its growth is slow, and it can live for decades, forming dense clusters on its host.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken the host tree over time, though it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife.</p>
