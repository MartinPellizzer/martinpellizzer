<p>Pinguicula grandiflora var. inaequilobata, commonly known as the unequal-lipped butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a unique subject for both ecological study and horticultural interest.</p>
