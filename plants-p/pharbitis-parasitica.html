                    <h1>Pharbitis parasitica</h1>
<p>Pharbitis parasitica, commonly known as the common morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant is a hemiparasite, meaning it attaches to host plants and derives some of its nutrients from them. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, orange-colored capsule that splits open when mature.</p>
<p>Pharbitis parasitica is often found in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in certain areas.</p>
