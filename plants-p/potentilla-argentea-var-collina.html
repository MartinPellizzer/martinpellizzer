                    <h1>Potentilla argentea var. collina</h1>
<p>Potentilla argentea var. collina, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with silver-white, woolly foliage that reflects sunlight and reduces heat absorption. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils.</p>
<p>This hardy species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh environments.</p>
