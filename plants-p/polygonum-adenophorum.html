<p>Polygonum adenophorum, commonly known as the hairy knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, often hairy stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, and it has heart-shaped to oval leaves with a rough texture. Polygonum adenophorum is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields.</p>
