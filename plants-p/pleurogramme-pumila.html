<p>Pleurogramme pumila, commonly known as the dwarf water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Asia.</p>
<p>It has delicate, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, making it less noticeable to the naked eye. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with soft, acidic substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its low light and nutrient requirements, it is a popular choice for aquariums and wetland restoration projects.</p>
