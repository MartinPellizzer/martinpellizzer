                    <h1>Poa chumbiensis</h1>
<p>Poa chumbiensis, commonly known as the Chumbi mountain grass, is a species of grass native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Tibet and northern India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats on rocky slopes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance in alpine ecosystems, it is often studied for its resilience and role in soil stabilization.</p>
