                    <h1>Phlegmariurus binervius</h1>
<p>Phlegmariurus binervius, commonly known as the two-veined clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen herb with a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit, often forming dense mats on forest floors. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in two rows along the stems, giving it its characteristic "two-veined" appearance. Its sporophytes develop in specialized structures called strobila, which bear the spore-producing organs.</p>
<p>Phlegmariurus binervius is typically found in moist, shaded environments and plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.</p>
