<p>Pneumatopteris christelloides, commonly known as the Christelloides water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
