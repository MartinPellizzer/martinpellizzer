<p>Phlegmariurus homocarpus, commonly known as the broad-leaf clubmoss, is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>It produces both sporophylls and microphylls, with the sporophylls bearing the spore-producing structures. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its reproductive structures are unique, with the sporophylls forming a club-like cluster at the tips of the branches.</p>
<p>Phlegmariurus homocarpus is an important component of the understory vegetation in many temperate and tropical ecosystems.</p>
