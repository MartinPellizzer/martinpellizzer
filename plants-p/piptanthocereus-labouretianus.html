<p>Piptanthocereus labouretianus, commonly known as the Labouret's night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and the presence of spines that provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its adaptations to extreme desert conditions include thick, waxy cuticles and the ability to store water in its stems.</p>
<p>This cactus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming behavior.</p>
