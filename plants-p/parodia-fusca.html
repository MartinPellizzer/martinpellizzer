<p>Parodia fusca, commonly known as the desert rose or sun rose, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white to pale green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Parodia fusca is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
