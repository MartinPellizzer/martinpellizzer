<p>Pedicularis polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leaved lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes hemiparasitic plants that derive some of their nutrients from host plants. The plant is characterized by its clusters of bright yellow, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
