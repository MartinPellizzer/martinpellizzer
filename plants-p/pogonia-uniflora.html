<p>Pogonia uniflora, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, showy pink and white flower with a single, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific soil conditions to thrive. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a threatened species in many areas.</p>
