                    <h1>Phippsia algida</h1>
<p>Phippsia algida, commonly known as the cold mountain phlox, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or alpine soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, Phippsia algida is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
