<p>Phelipanche purpurea, commonly known as the purple witch's hair, is an annual flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on host plants for water and nutrients through its specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant produces showy, purple or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a weed in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of suitable host plants, which can include various grasses and legumes.</p>
