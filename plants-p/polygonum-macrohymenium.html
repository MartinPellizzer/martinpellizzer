                    <h1>Polygonum macrohymenium</h1>
<p>Polygonum macrohymenium, commonly known as the giant knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, rhizomatous growth habit and large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 20 cm in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with pale pink to white petals, typically blooming in late summer. Its extensive root system allows it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often forming dense stands that can dominate wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas.</p>
