<p>Primula chionogenes, commonly known as the snow-flower primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Primula chionogenes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
