                    <h1>Pritchardia kahukuensis</h1>
<p>Pritchardia kahukuensis, commonly known as the Kahuku palaui, is a rare cycad native to the Hawaiian island of Oahu.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant is adapted to the dry, coastal habitats of its native range, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered, with very few mature individuals remaining in the wild.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique botanical species.</p>
