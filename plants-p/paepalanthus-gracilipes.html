<p>Paepalanthus gracilipes, commonly known as the slender pincushion cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are modified into small, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Paepalanthus gracilipes is adapted to thrive in cool, dry climates and is often found in mountainous habitats.</p>
