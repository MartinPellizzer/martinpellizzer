                    <h1>Pentacalia epiphytica</h1>
<p>Pentacalia epiphytica, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, showy white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in the Florida scrub and sandhill regions. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
