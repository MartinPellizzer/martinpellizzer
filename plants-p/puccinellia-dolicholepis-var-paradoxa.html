<p>Puccinellia dolicholepis var. paradoxa, commonly known as the paradoxical spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in ecological studies due to its resilience and potential for use in restoration projects.</p>
