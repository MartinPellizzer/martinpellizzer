                    <h1>Phegopteris galeottii</h1>
<p>Phegopteris galeottii, commonly known as the Galeotti's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the surface of freshwater habitats. The plant typically grows in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, sunlit environments. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Phegopteris galeottii plays a role in water filtration and is an indicator species for clean, well-oxygenated water.</p>
