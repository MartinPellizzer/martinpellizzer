<p>It is a small, deciduous shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid, coastal climate of its native habitat. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Petersia klainei is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
