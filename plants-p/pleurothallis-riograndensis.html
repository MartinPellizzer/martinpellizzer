<p>Pleurothallis riograndensis, commonly known as the Rio Grande orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
