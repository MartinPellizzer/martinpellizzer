<p>Pectis samanensis, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, characterized by its hairy stems and dark green, lobed leaves. The plant produces bright yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its succulent leaves and stems allow it to store water, making it well-adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Pectis samanensis plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
