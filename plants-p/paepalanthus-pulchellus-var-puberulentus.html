<p>Paepalanthus pulchellus var. puberulentus, commonly known as the velvet cup cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of pale green to grayish hairs, which helps protect it from intense sunlight and water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptations, it is a popular choice for succulent collectors and desert gardens.</p>
