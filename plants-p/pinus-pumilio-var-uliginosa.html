                    <h1>Pinus pumilio var. uliginosa</h1>
<p>Pinus pumilio var. uliginosa, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine or the alpine pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its short stature, typically growing no taller than 1.5 meters, and its dense, compact growth habit. Its needles are short, dark green, and often coated with a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The cones are small and often remain closed for many years, releasing seeds only under specific environmental conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is well adapted to the extreme conditions of its alpine habitat.</p>
