                    <h1>Pourretia speciosa</h1>
<p>Pourretia speciosa, commonly known as the showy false hellebore, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and a distinctive white or pale green underside. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist, shaded woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided by herbivores but can be a valuable component of native plant communities.</p>
