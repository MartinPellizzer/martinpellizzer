                    <h1>Panicum equitans</h1>
<p>Panicum equitans, commonly known as the horse-tail grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and swamps, and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by water and wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Panicum equitans plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
