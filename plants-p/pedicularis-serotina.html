<p>Pedicularis serotina, commonly known as the late flowering monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe, it thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
