                    <h1>Pothuava nudicaulis var. glabriuscula</h1>
<p>Pothuava nudicaulis var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the smooth-leaved pothuava, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically hairless or nearly so, giving it a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warm season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
