                    <h1>Prunus minutiflora</h1>
<p>Prunus minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or rock cherry, is a small deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with slender branches and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible but often sour. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its delicate blooms and ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
