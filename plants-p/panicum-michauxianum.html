<p>Panicum michauxianum, commonly known as Michaux's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet to mesic habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are often blue-green in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
