                    <h1>Panicum debile</h1>
<p>Panicum debile, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces delicate, spikelike inflorescences that bear small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and sandy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
