<p>Pleroma exappendiculatum, commonly known as the appendiculate pleura, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Gesneriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring showy, tubular corollas with prominent appendages that distinguish it from other members of the genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pleroma exappendiculatum is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
