                    <h1>Peliosanthes divaricatanthera</h1>
<p>Peliosanthes divaricatanthera, commonly known as the variable-lobed orchid, is a rare and unusual orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, branched floral structure, which sets it apart from most other orchid genera. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns, and it produces small, elongated fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
