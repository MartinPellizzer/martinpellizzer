                    <h1>Pachyphyllum uniflorum</h1>
<p>Pachyphyllum uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower thickleaf cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces a single, showy yellow flower at the top of its stem, typically during the warm season. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Pachyphyllum uniflorum is often cultivated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
