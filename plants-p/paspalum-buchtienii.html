                    <h1>Paspalum buchtienii</h1>
<p>Paspalum buchtienii, commonly known as the desert paspalum, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Paspalum buchtienii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils in degraded environments.</p>
