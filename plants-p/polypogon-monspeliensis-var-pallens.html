                    <h1>Polypogon monspeliensis var. pallens</h1>
<p>Polypogon monspeliensis var. pallens, commonly known as the pale sandreed, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open, sunny habitats such as dunes or disturbed areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>The pale sandreed is often found in coastal regions and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and dry conditions.</p>
