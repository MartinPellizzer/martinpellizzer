                    <h1>Phoradendron caracasanum var. parvifolium</h1>
<p>Phoradendron caracasanum var. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and has a distinctive appearance with small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse its seeds. Its roots form haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to absorb water and nutrients.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ecological role in supporting bird populations and contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
