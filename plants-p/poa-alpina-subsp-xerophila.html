<p>Poa alpina subsp.</p>
<p>xerophila, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are adapted to cold and windy environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The plant exhibits a high degree of morphological variation in response to environmental stressors, making it a resilient component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
