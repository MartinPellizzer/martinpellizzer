                    <h1>Potentilla erecta f. pusilla</h1>
<p>Potentilla erecta f. pusilla, commonly known as dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a vibrant touch to its alpine habitat. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic value.</p>
