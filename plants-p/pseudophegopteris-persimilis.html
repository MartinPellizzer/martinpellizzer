                    <h1>Pseudophegopteris persimilis</h1>
<p>Pseudophegopteris persimilis, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocky cliffs and stream banks. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hair. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing clusters, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecological health.</p>
