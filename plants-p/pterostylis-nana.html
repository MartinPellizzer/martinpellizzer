                    <h1>Pterostylis nana</h1>
<p>Pterostylis nana, commonly known as the dwarf greenhood, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with a single, slender stem that bears a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a single, pale green to yellowish flower with a distinctive hood-like structure, which is characteristic of the greenhood orchid genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is often overlooked but plays an important role in its ecosystem.</p>
