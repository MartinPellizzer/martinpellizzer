                    <h1>Psilotrichum trichotomum</h1>
<p>Psilotrichum trichotomum, commonly known as the three-branched clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and primitive features make it a valuable subject for studying early plant evolution.</p>
