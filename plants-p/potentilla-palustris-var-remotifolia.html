                    <h1>Potentilla palustris var. remotifolia</h1>
<p>Potentilla palustris var. remotifolia, commonly known as the distant-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist, sandy soils in northern regions.</p>
<p>It features wiry, creeping stems that often form dense mats, with small, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellowish-white flowers in late summer, which are borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
