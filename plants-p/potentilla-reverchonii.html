<p>Potentilla reverchonii, commonly known as the Alaskan cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, alpine, or tundra environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces showy, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
