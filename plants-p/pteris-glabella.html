<p>Pteris glabella, commonly known as the smooth holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green fronds that are smooth and lack the hairy texture found in many other ferns. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its fronds are typically lance-shaped and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>Pteris glabella thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
