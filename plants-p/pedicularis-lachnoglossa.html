                    <h1>Pedicularis lachnoglossa</h1>
<p>Pedicularis lachnoglossa, commonly known as the woolly-lipped monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that are often pink or purple in color. The plant is an epiphytic or lithophytic species, meaning it grows on other plants or rocks rather than in soil. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Pedicularis lachnoglossa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display.</p>
