                    <h1>Potamogeton × nitens f. obtusus</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × nitens f. obtusus, commonly known as the broad-leaved pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, elongated leaves that are typically smooth and rounded at the tips. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like structures, often submerged or floating at the water's surface. It is often found in shallow, slow-moving waters such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Its presence can indicate good water quality and is sometimes used as an indicator species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
