<p>Pimela altissima, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. The plant has showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths.
