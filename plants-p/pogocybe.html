                    <h1>Pogocybe</h1>
<p>Pogocybe, commonly known as the pink cap polypore, is a genus of fungi that belongs to the family Polyporaceae.</p>
<p>These fungi are characterized by their woody, bracket-shaped fruiting bodies that often have a pink or reddish coloration. They are typically found growing on dead and decaying wood, especially in temperate and tropical forests. Pogocybe species are saprophytic, playing a role in the decomposition of organic matter in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Their spore-producing structures, called pores, are distinct from the gills of other fungi, contributing to their identification.</p>
