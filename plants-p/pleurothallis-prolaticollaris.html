<p>Pleurothallis prolaticollaris, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>

The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are elongated and often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike.</p>
