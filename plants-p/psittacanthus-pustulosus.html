<p>Psittacanthus pustulosus, commonly known as the spiny sphaerocarp, is a member of the Sphaerocarpaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, perennial aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and its distinctive, spiny, spore-bearing structures called sphaerocarps. Its leaves are usually thin and ribbon-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
