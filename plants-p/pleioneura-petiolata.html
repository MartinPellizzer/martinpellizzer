                    <h1>Pleioneura petiolata</h1>
<p>Pleioneura petiolata, commonly known as the leafy pleione, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the spring and early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is also considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
