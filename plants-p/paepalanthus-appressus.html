<p>Paepalanthus appressus, commonly known as the velvetleaf cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, fleshy stems covered in soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are usually reduced to small scales, and it stores water in its thick stems, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Paepalanthus appressus is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives with minimal water.</p>
