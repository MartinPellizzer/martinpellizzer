                    <h1>Paepalanthus hilairei</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus hilairei, commonly known as the Hilaire's cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly found in Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, columnar stems that store water for survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Paepalanthus hilairei is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy plant in desert or semi-desert habitats.</p>
