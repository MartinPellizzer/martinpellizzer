                    <h1>Polypodium vulgare var. deceptum</h1>
<p>Polypodium vulgare var. deceptum, commonly known as the false huperzia, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizome and its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and leathery in texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This variant is often confused with other polypodium species due to its similar appearance, which has led to its common name.</p>
