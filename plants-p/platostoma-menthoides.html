                    <h1>Platostoma menthoides</h1>
<p>Platostoma menthoides, commonly known as the creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats of tiny, fragrant leaves that resemble those of thyme, hence its common name. It produces small, two-lipped flowers that are often pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Platostoma menthoides is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
