<p>Polygonum amplexicaule var. suffultum, commonly known as the creeping knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a reddish or purple tinge, especially on the underside. It produces small, clustered flowers in late summer, typically in shades of pink or white.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain environments.</p>
