<p>Pinguicula alba, commonly known as the white butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs or wet meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its unique trapping mechanism and aesthetic appeal, it is a popular choice for carnivorous plant enthusiasts.</p>
