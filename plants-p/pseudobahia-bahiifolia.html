                    <h1>Pseudobahia bahiifolia</h1>
<p>Pseudobahia bahiifolia, commonly known as the Bahia grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and tufted growth habit, making it a popular choice for lawns and erosion control. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its dense, uniform appearance and ability to form a lush, green carpet.</p>
