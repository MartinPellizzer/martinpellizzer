                    <h1>Priva adhaerens</h1>
<p>Priva adhaerens, commonly known as the sticky fern, is a unique species of fern characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that produce a sticky substance.</p>
<p>This botanical feature aids in trapping moisture and deterring herbivores. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil or rocky surfaces.</p>
<p>The sticky secretions also contribute to its role in ecological interactions, such as aiding in the decomposition of organic matter.</p>
