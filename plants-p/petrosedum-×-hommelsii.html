<p>Petrosedum × hommelsii, commonly known as the hybrid stonecress, is a low-growing succulent native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a mat-like structure, often covering rocky substrates. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>Petrosedum × hommelsii is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
