                    <h1>Pinus tabuliformis var. pygmaea</h1>
<p>Pinus tabuliformis var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf Chinese fir, is a compact evergreen conifer native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical trunk and dense, pyramidal crown, which gives it a shrub-like appearance despite being a conifer. The plant produces small, yellowish-green needles that are arranged in bundles of five, and its cones are typically reddish-brown and relatively small. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and as a container plant due to its slow growth and compact size.</p>
