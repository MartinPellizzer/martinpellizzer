                    <h1>Parapolystichum perrierianum</h1>
<p>Parapolystichum perrierianum, commonly known as the Perrier's cliff brake, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in shaded rock crevices. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
