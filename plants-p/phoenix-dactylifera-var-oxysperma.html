                    <h1>Phoenix dactylifera var. oxysperma</h1>
<p>Phoenix dactylifera var. oxysperma, commonly known as the date palm variety with high seed content, is a variant of the date palm native to the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and broad, fan-shaped leaves that are typically darker green than the standard date palm. The fruit is smaller and has a higher proportion of seeds compared to the common date variety, making it less commercially viable but valuable for genetic research. This variety is often studied for its resilience to environmental stress and its potential in breeding programs for improved date palm cultivars.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject in plant genetics and horticultural science.</p>
