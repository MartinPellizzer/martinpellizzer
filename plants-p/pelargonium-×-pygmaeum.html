                    <h1>Pelargonium × pygmaeum</h1>
<p>Pelargonium × pygmaeum, commonly known as the miniature geranium, is a compact, trailing plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves with a velvety texture and produces clusters of five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its low-growing habit. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening.</p>
