                    <h1>Potamogeton rotundifolius</h1>
<p>Potamogeton rotundifolius, commonly known as round-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It has broad, rounded leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, lakes, and marshes. Its dense growth can provide habitat for aquatic organisms and help stabilize sediment.</p>
<p>However, it can also become invasive in certain water bodies if not managed properly.</p>
