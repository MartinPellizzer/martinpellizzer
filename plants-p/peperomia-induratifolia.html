<p>Peperomia induratifolia, commonly known as the rugged peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color, followed by bright red berries. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
