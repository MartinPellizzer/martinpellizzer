                    <h1>Phlomis umbrosa</h1>
<p>Phlomis umbrosa, commonly known as shadow phlomis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems covered in soft, woolly hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces spikes of purple or pink flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
