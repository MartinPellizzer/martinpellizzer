                    <h1>Petrosedum sediforme</h1>
<p>Petrosedum sediforme, commonly known as the cushion sedum, is a low-growing succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact rosettes of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a valuable addition to xeriscaping efforts.</p>
