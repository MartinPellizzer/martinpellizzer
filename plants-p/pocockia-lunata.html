                    <h1>Pocockia lunata</h1>
<p>Pocockia lunata, commonly known as the moonflower fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that resemble the shape of a crescent moon, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pocockia lunata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
