                    <h1>Pachypterygium multicaule</h1>
<p>Pachypterygium multicaule, commonly known as the multibract fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Its rhizome is fibrous and serves as a storage organ, allowing it to survive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>The multibract fern is often found in dense, humid forests where it thrives in the understory.</p>
