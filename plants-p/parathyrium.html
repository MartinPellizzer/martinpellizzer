                    <h1>Parathyrium</h1>
<p>Parathyrium, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that often appear translucent or semi-transparent, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Parathyrium species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks rather than in soil.</p>
<p>These plants are valued for their ornamental beauty and are often cultivated in humid, indoor environments.</p>
