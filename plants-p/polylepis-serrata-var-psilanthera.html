<p>Polylepis serrata var. psilanthera, commonly known as the Andean cloud forest tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude cloud forests of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and distinctive serrated leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
