<p>Phoradendron macrarthrum, commonly known as the long-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together, followed by berries that are typically red or orange in color. It relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing food for birds and other animals, as well as contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
