                    <h1>Pinus pumilio var. marginata</h1>
<p>Pinus pumilio var. marginata, commonly known as the whitebark pine with a marginated variant, is a rare and distinctive subspecies of the whitebark pine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, cone-like fruits and its unique foliage that often displays a white or silvery margin on the leaves. This variant is native to high-altitude regions of the western United States, where it thrives in cold, dry environments. Its cones are typically serotinous, meaning they remain closed until triggered by fire or extreme heat.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in alpine ecosystems.</p>
