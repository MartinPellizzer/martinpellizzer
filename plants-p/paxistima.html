                    <h1>Paxistima</h1>
<p>Paxistima, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a unique succulent that belongs to the family Crassulaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States and is characterized by its ability to survive extreme drought conditions by curling into a compact ball. The plant's leaves are fleshy and thick, adapted to store water efficiently. Paxistima reproduces through seeds and can also propagate vegetatively from its stems.</p>
<p>When water becomes available, it "resurrects," uncurling and regaining its green appearance.</p>
