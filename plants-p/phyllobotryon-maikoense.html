<p>Phyllobotryon maikoense, commonly known as the Maiko fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the rainforests of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phyllobotryon maikoense is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
