                    <h1>Poa freartitis</h1>
<p>Poa freartitis, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is well adapted to harsh climatic conditions, including strong winds and limited nutrient availability.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance, Poa freartitis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
