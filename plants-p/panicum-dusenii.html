<p>Panicum dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear delicate, white or pale green flowers. It is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
