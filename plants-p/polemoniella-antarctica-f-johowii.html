                    <h1>Polemoniella antarctica f. johowii</h1>
<p>Polemoniella antarctica f. johowii, commonly known as the Antarctic polemonium, is a rare and frost-tolerant plant native to the high-altitude regions of Antarctica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in the brief summer months. The plant exhibits a low-growing, cushion-like growth form, which helps it conserve heat and moisture in its extreme environment. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing additional insulation against the harsh climate.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to survive in one of the most extreme environments on Earth.</p>
