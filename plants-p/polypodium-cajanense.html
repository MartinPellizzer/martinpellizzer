<p>Polypodium cajanense, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically leathery and dark green. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping rhizomes that help it spread across forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Polypodium cajanense thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
