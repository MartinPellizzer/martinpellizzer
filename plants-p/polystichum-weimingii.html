<p>Polystichum weimingii, commonly known as the Weiming shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and bearing spore-producing structures on their undersides.</p>
