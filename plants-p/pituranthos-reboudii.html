                    <h1>Pituranthos reboudii</h1>
<p>Pituranthos reboudii, commonly known as the golden ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale yellow or white petals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It produces small, delicate flowers that bloom in late summer, often in isolated, difficult-to-reach locations.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
