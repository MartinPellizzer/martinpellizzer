<p>Phalaris semineutra, commonly known as the sterile phalaris, is a grass-like plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that rarely produce viable seeds. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited seed production, it relies on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
<p>It is of interest to botanists due to its unique reproductive characteristics and ecological adaptations.</p>
