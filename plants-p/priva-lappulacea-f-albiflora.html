                    <h1>Priva lappulacea f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Priva lappulacea f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered lappula, is a rare botanical variant characterized by its pale or white flowers.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in temperate regions. Its foliage is lance-shaped with a hairy texture, and the flowers are small and clustered in racemes.</p>
<p>This form is less common than the typical green-flowered variant, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
