                    <h1>Phoradendron domingense</h1>
<p>Phoradendron domingense, commonly known as the Dominican mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the Caribbean and Central America.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, where it can weaken the host tree over time.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its ornamental value and traditional use in local cultures.</p>
