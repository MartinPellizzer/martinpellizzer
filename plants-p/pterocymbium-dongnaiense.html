<p>Pterocymbium dongnaiense, commonly known as the Dong Nai orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small, with a distinctive coloration that ranges from pale yellow to white, and it blooms during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Pterocymbium dongnaiense is considered vulnerable, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
