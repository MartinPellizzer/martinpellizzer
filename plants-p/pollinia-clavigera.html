                    <h1>Pollinia clavigera</h1>
<p>Pollinia clavigera, commonly known as the black orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, velvety petals and a striking, elongated lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. The plant produces pollinia, which are specialized structures that adhere to the bodies of insects, facilitating cross-pollination. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and a complex, spurred flower structure.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in its native range.</p>
