<p>Populus davidiana f. tomentella, commonly known as the tomentose poplar, is a unique variant of the poplar species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows in forested areas at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a silvery underside that reflects light and reduces heat absorption.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
