<p>Phyllanthus aphanostylus, commonly known as the ghost-stem phyllanthus, is a unique plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, almost stemless appearance, with small, clustered leaves that are often obscured by the dense foliage. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its leaves are succulent and can store water, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Despite its unassuming appearance, it is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
