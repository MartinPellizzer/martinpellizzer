<p>Panicum gracilescens, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and adaptability, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover.</p>
