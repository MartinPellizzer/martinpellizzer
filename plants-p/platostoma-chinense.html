                    <h1>Platostoma chinense</h1>
<p>Platostoma chinense, commonly known as the Chinese flat lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like thallus that is typically light green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found growing on rocks or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Platostoma chinense is relatively uncommon and is of interest to lichenologists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche.</p>
