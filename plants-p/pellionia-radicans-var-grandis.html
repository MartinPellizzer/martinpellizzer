                    <h1>Pellionia radicans var. grandis</h1>
<p>Pellionia radicans var. grandis, commonly known as the giant trailing pellionia, is a tropical evergreen vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are typically larger than those of the standard species. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as a ground cover or hanging plant in tropical gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its lush foliage and ability to cascade gracefully from containers or trellises.</p>
