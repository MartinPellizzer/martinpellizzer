                    <h1>Paepalanthus castaneus</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus castaneus, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that form a rosette structure, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It prefers nutrient-rich, sunny environments and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens and ponds.</p>
