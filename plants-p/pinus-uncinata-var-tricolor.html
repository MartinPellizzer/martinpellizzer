                    <h1>Pinus uncinata var. tricolor</h1>
<p>Pinus uncinata var. tricolor, commonly known as the tricolor pine, is a rare and striking variant of the Spanish pine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive three-color foliage, with needles displaying a combination of green, blue, and silver tones. This variation is due to genetic factors that affect chlorophyll and carotenoid pigmentation. The tree typically grows in high-altitude regions of the Iberian Peninsula, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance makes it a notable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
