                    <h1>Pedicularis sibirica</h1>
<p>Pedicularis sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and showy, spurred flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. Its flowers, which range in color from yellow to red, are adapted for pollination by insects such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Pedicularis sibirica thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats.</p>
