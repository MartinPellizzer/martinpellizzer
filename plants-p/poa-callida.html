                    <h1>Poa callida</h1>
<p>Poa callida, commonly known as the narrowleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along stream banks, where it contributes to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is also cultivated in ornamental landscaping.</p>
