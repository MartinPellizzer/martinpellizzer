<p>Polystichum paradoxum, commonly known as the paradox fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish spores.
