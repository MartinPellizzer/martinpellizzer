                    <h1>Pteris gigantea</h1>
<p>Pteris gigantea, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its fronds are divided into small, serrated pinnae, which help in photosynthesis and gas exchange.</p>
<p>Pteris gigantea plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
