                    <h1>Packera dimorphophylla var. paysonii</h1>
<p>Packera dimorphophylla var. paysonii, commonly known as Payson's pearly everlet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically basal, with a distinctive pearly or waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Packera dimorphophylla.</p>
