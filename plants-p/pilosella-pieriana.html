                    <h1>Pilosella pieriana</h1>
<p>Pilosella pieriana, commonly known as the alpine pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine meadows. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Pilosella pieriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
