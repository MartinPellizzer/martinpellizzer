                    <h1>Prismatocarpus subulatus var. pauciflorus</h1>
<p>Prismatocarpus subulatus var. pauciflorus, commonly known as the slender-leafed prismatocarpus, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited floral display, it is a less common species within the genus Prismatocarpus.</p>
