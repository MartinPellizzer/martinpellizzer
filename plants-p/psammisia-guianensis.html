<p>Psammisia guianensis, commonly known as the Guianese sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, round capsule that contains several seeds, contributing to its role in seed dispersal in its native habitat.</p>
