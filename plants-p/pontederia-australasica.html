                    <h1>Pontederia australasica</h1>
<p>Pontederia australasica, commonly known as the Australian water hyacinth, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Australia and New Guinea.</p>
<p>It features broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with a waxy coating that helps repel water. The plant produces clusters of vibrant blue to purple flowers, which bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, and it can spread rapidly in still or slow-moving water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
