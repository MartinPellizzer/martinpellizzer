<p>Pseudocyclosorus zayuensis, commonly known as the Yungui Cyclosorus, is a rare fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
