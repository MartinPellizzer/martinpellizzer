<p>Padus asiatica, commonly known as the Asian whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, spherical berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks.</p>
<p>The bark of Padus asiatica is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age.</p>
