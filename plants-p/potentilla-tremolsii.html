                    <h1>Potentilla tremolsii</h1>
<p>Potentilla tremolsii, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes where conditions are harsh. The plant features small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a splash of color to its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in cold, windy conditions.</p>
<p>Potentilla tremolsii is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in garden settings that mimic its natural environment.</p>
