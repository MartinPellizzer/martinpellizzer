                    <h1>Psophiza</h1>
<p>Psophiza, commonly known as the mountain lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to South America.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their striking, showy flowers that often feature vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. Psophiza species typically grow in high-altitude environments, including Andean regions, where they adapt to cooler temperatures and lower oxygen levels. The plants have fibrous roots and are often found in rocky or mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Their flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, which are attracted to their nectar-rich blooms.</p>
