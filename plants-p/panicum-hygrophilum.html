<p>Panicum hygrophilum, commonly known as marsh panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist or swampy areas, often forming dense stands that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, silver-gray seed heads that are highly visible during the summer months. It is adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has also led to its cultivation in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
