                    <h1>Pogonia acuminata</h1>
<p>Pogonia acuminata, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid pink and white petals, with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollinator trap. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. It produces showy flowers in late spring to early summer, and its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
