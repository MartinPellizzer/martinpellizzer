                    <h1>Polystichum × inayatii</h1>
<p>Polystichum × inayatii, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Polystichum acrostichum and Polystichum polystichum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are typically glossy and have a dense, upright growth habit. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its fronds are often divided into multiple segments with a zigzag pattern along the midrib. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
