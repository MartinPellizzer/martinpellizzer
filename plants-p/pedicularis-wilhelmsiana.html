                    <h1>Pedicularis wilhelmsiana</h1>
<p>Pedicularis wilhelmsiana, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble tiny monkeys, hence its common name. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
