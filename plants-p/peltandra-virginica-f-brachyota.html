<p>Peltandra virginica f. brachyota, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white, arrowhead-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure makes it well-adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
