                    <h1>Psoralea subulata var. minor</h1>
<p>Psoralea subulata var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved psoralea, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, glandular, trifoliate leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a desirable plant for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscapes.</p>
