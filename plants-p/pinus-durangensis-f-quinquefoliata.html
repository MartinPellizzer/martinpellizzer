                    <h1>Pinus durangensis f. quinquefoliata</h1>
<p>Pinus durangensis f. quinquefoliata, commonly known as the Durango pine variant with five-leafed foliage, is a rare botanical form native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive five-needle clusters, which set it apart from other pine species. The leaves are typically longer and more slender than those of the typical Durango pine, contributing to its unique appearance. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist climates.</p>
<p>This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its genetic and morphological distinctiveness.</p>
