                    <h1>Parnassia palustris var. multiseta</h1>
<p>Parnassia palustris var. multiseta, commonly known as the swamp parnassia, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and bog environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers with prominent yellow spots, which are characteristic of the Parnassia genus. It thrives in poorly drained soils and requires consistent moisture.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its multiple stamens, which give it the specific epithet "multiseta.".</p>
