                    <h1>Pandanus extralittoralis</h1>
<p>Pandanus extralittoralis, commonly known as the coastal pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is a large, woody shrub or small tree that typically grows near coastal areas, tolerating salty air and sandy soils. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fibrous, palm-like fruits. Its roots help stabilize coastal dunes, making it an important species for erosion control.</p>
<p>The plant's resilience to harsh coastal conditions makes it a significant component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
