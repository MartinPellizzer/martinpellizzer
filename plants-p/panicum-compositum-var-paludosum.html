<p>Panicum compositum var. paludosum, commonly known as marsh panicum, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, thriving in saturated soils. The plant features slender, erect stalks with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, tan to reddish-brown seed heads. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to support local wildlife.</p>
