                    <h1>Poacynum scabrum</h1>
<p>Poacynum scabrum, commonly known as the death camas, is a toxic plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its most notable feature is the presence of toxic alkaloids, particularly scabrin, which can be lethal to humans and animals if ingested.</p>
<p>Due to its poisonous nature, it is often avoided in both natural and cultivated settings.</p>
