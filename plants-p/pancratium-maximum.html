                    <h1>Pancratium maximum</h1>
<p>Pancratium maximum, commonly known as the yellow rain lily, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a bulbous root system that stores nutrients and water, allowing it to thrive in coastal and sandy environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Pancratium maximum is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its traditional uses in medicine and as a source of natural dyes.</p>
