                    <h1>Parnassia wightiana var. brachyloba</h1>
<p>Parnassia wightiana var. brachyloba, commonly known as the short-stalked fairy cup, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its small, white, cup-shaped flowers that resemble a fairy's cup. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in alpine meadows or forest understories. Its leaves are palmately divided and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
