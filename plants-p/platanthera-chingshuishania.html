<p>Platanthera chingshuishania, commonly known as the Chinghsui orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive white lip. The plant thrives in moist, shaded forest habitats, often growing on rock surfaces or in mossy areas. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
