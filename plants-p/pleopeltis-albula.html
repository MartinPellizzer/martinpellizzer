<p>Pleopeltis albula, commonly known as the white-veined rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, light green fronds with distinctive white veins. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, moss-like layer that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups.</p>
