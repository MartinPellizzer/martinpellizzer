                    <h1>Platanthera longibracteata</h1>
<p>Platanthera longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bracted twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded forest habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant lacks true leaves, instead having reduced, scale-like structures called bracts that cover the stem. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>
<p>Platanthera longibracteata is typically found in rich, humusy soils and thrives in areas with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
