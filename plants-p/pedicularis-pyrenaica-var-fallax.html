                    <h1>Pedicularis pyrenaica var. fallax</h1>
<p>Pedicularis pyrenaica var. fallax, commonly known as the Pyrenean lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, often in rocky or open areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable species in its native ecosystems.</p>
