                    <h1>Potentilla villosa var. parviflora</h1>
<p>Potentilla villosa var. parviflora, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in groups of five, typically blooming in early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in alpine environments.</p>
