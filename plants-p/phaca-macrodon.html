                    <h1>Phaca macrodon</h1>
<p>Phaca macrodon, commonly known as the large-leaf water plantain, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense spikes and bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>Phaca macrodon plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for aquatic invertebrates and amphibians.</p>
