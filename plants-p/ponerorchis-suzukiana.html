<p>Ponerorchis suzukiana, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale green or white flowers that resemble translucent, ghostly forms. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
