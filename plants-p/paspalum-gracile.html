                    <h1>Paspalum gracile</h1>
<p>Paspalum gracile, commonly known as slender paspalum, is a low-growing grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or pale yellow. This plant is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along water bodies due to its tolerance for moist conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Paspalum gracile is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in landscaping.</p>
