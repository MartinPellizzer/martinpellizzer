<p>Poa ursorum, commonly known as the Arctic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Poa ursorum plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its extreme habitat.</p>
