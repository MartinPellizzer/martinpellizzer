<p>Polystachya affinis var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a compact, clump-forming plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>

The plant produces small, white to pale green inflorescences that are characteristic of the Polystachya genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and ornamental appeal, it is cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens.</p>
