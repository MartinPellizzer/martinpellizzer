                    <h1>Paepalanthus viscosus</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus viscosus, commonly known as the sticky pear or viscous pear, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike at the center of the rosette. Its leaves are covered in a thick, sticky substance that helps in trapping insects, which in turn provide nutrients to the plant.</p>
<p>Paepalanthus viscosus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid environments.</p>
