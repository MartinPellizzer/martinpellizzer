The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Prevostea ferruginea make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation.</p>
