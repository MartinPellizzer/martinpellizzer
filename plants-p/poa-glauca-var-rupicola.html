                    <h1>Poa glauca var. rupicola</h1>
<p>Poa glauca var. rupicola, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a variant of the bluegrass species native to high-altitude regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in harsh alpine environments with limited nutrients. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates.</p>
