<p>Pinus wangii subsp.</p>
<p>varifolia, commonly known as the variable leaf pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, with leaves that vary in shape and size across different parts of the tree, giving it its subspecies name "varifolia.".</p>
<p>The tree typically grows in high-altitude forests, where it adapts to cool and humid conditions. Its cones are relatively small and often hang in clusters, contributing to its ecological role in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
