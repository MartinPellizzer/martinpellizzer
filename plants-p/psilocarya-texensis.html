<p>Psilocarya texensis, commonly known as the Texas psilocybin mushroom, is a species of psychedelic fungi native to the United States, particularly found in Texas and surrounding regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Psilocybe, which includes several species known for containing psychoactive compounds such as psilocybin and psilocin. The fruiting bodies of Psilocarya texensis typically appear as small, clustered mushrooms with a cap that ranges from white to pale brown in color. These mushrooms thrive in moist, shaded environments, often growing on decaying organic matter like wood or leaf litter.</p>
<p>Due to their psychoactive properties, they are of interest in both scientific research and cultural practices involving entheogenic use.</p>
