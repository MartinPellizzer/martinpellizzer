                    <h1>Phreatia elegans</h1>
<p>Phreatia elegans, commonly known as the elegant phreatia, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high air circulation.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in tropical ecosystems.</p>
