                    <h1>Psychotria aegialodes</h1>
<p>Psychotria aegialodes, commonly known as the beach psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species with medicinal and ornamental value. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines, adapting to salty and wind-exposed environments. Its small, tubular flowers are usually white or pale blue, and it produces small, dark berries that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is often found in association with other coastal flora in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
