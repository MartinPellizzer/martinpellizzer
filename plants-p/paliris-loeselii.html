<p>Paliris loeselii, commonly known as the Loesel's paliris, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure, typical of bromeliads. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of red or orange, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds.</p>
