<p>Phelypaea nana f. robusta, commonly known as the dwarf water starwort, is a variant of the water starwort plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and delicate, floating leaves. The leaves are typically narrow and pointed, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often floating on the water's surface.</p>
<p>This plant plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
