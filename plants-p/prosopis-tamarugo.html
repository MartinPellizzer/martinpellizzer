<p>Prosopis tamarugo, commonly known as the Tamarugo tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in northern Chile and southern Peru.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to extreme desert conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. The plant has small, feathery leaves and produces yellow pods that contain seeds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to overgrazing and climate change, the Tamarugo tree is now considered endangered.</p>
