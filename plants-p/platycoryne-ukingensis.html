                    <h1>Platycoryne ukingensis</h1>
<p>Platycoryne ukingensis, commonly known as the Ukinge flat-leaf, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within montane forests, where it forms part of the understory vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Platycoryne ukingensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
