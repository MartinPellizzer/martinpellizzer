                    <h1>Pinus sosnowskyi</h1>
<p>Pinus sosnowskyi, commonly known as the Sosnowsky's pine, is a rare and critically endangered conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The tree produces long, slender cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cold, dry climates and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, its population has drastically declined, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
