                    <h1>Priestleya lancifolia</h1>
<p>Priestleya lancifolia, commonly known as the lanceleaf cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has adapted to arid environments with a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it relies on its extensive root system to absorb moisture from the soil.</p>
<p>Priestleya lancifolia is often found in rocky soils and is a valuable plant for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
