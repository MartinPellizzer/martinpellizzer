                <h1>Patagonium pusillum</h1>
<p>Patagonium pusillum, commonly known as the Patagonian dwarf grass, is a small perennial herb native to the southern regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in cool and temperate climates. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered at the ends of the stems, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
