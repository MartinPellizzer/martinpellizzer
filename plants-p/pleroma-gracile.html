<p>Pleroma gracile, commonly known as the slender pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant has a compact growth habit with short, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Pleroma gracile is often found growing on trees or rocks, thriving in the cool, misty conditions of high-altitude regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural environment.</p>
