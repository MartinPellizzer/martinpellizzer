<p>Polypodium pilosissimum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser hairy shield fern, is a variant of the hairy shield fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces multiple shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
