                            <h1>Physalis Hispida</h1>
<p>Physalis hispida, commonly known as the rough husk tomato, is a unique member of the nightshade family native to the Americas. This plant is characterized by its hairy stems and distinctive orange-red capsules that encase its small, edible fruits. While not widely cultivated for food, it is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance. The plant thrives in dry, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh conditions. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>
