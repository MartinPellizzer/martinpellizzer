                    <h1>Psilocaulon mentiens</h1>
<p>Psilocaulon mentiens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a unique, intricate structure that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
