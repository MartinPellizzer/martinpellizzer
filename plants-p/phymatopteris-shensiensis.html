<p>Phymatopteris shensiensis, commonly known as the Sichuan maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are underground stems that help in nutrient absorption and propagation.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which is a common feature among ferns.</p>
