                    <h1>Paphiopedilum wentworthianum</h1>
<p>Paphiopedilum wentworthianum, commonly known as the Wentworth's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It features a unique, pouch-like lip that is a defining characteristic of the lady's slipper orchid genus. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial herb with a short rhizome and a single, broad, ovate leaf. Its flowers are usually pale yellow with a deep red or maroon lip, and they bloom in late summer or early autumn.</p>
<p>This species is highly valued in horticulture for its beauty and rarity, though it is threatened by habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
