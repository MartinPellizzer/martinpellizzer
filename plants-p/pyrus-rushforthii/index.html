                            <h1>Pyrus Rushforthii</h1>
<p>Pyrus rushforthii is a rare and lesser-known species of apple tree native to the mountainous regions of China. This deciduous plant is characterized by its small stature and distinctive, spiny bark that provides natural protection against herbivores. Its leaves are typically narrow and dark green, while its flowers are pale yellow and appear in clusters during the spring. Though not widely cultivated, it holds significant ecological value in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited propagation, Pyrus rushforthii is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
