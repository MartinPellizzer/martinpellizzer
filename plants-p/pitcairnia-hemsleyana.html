                    <h1>Pitcairnia hemsleyana</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia hemsleyana, commonly known as the Hemsley's pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, spathaceous inflorescence that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, surrounded by vibrant, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, a common adaptation in its humid, shaded habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of exotic plants.</p>
