<p>Pilosella obscura subsp.</p>
<p>aquilonaris, commonly known as the Alpine Mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, compact clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive species, often requiring conservation efforts to protect its natural range.</p>
