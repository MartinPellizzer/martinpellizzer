<p>Phainantha maguirei, commonly known as the Maguire's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale, translucent petals and a delicate, elongated flower spike. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically within the understory of hardwood forests. Its small, green leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces a single, showy flower that blooms briefly during the late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
