                    <h1>Pogonia tetraphylla</h1>
<p>Pogonia tetraphylla, commonly known as the purple twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and single, showy purple flower. The plant is a mycoheterotroph, meaning it relies on fungal associations for its nutrients rather than photosynthesis. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with specific tree species.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
