<p>Peltopus calviventer, commonly known as the smooth-headed peltopus, is a rare and unique plant species found in specific alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, which bloom in late spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
