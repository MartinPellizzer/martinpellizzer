                    <h1>Parablechnum roraimense</h1>
<p>Parablechnum roraimense, commonly known as the Roraima fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the tepuis of Venezuela and Guyana.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that arise from a short, creeping rhizome. The plant thrives in the humid, shaded environments of cloud forests at high altitudes. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying adaptive evolution.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile habitat, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment.</p>
