                    <h1>Pinus ericetorum</h1>
<p>Pinus ericetorum, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a small evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows at high altitudes, where it forms dense, cushion-like colonies to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant has short, twisted branches and small, needle-like leaves that are dark green and often covered in a waxy coating. Its cones are small and woody, containing edible seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to rocky and acidic soils, making it a characteristic component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems.</p>
