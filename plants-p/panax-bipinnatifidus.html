                    <h1>Panax bipinnatifidus</h1>
<p>Panax bipinnatifidus, commonly known as the Chinese ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnatifid leaves that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, followed by red berries that contain the seeds. It is valued for its roots, which are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species.</p>
