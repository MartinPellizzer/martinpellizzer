                    <h1>Phacelia viscida f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Phacelia viscida f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered sticky phacelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its glandular, hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its sticky secretions on the leaves and stems are a key botanical feature, aiding in moisture retention and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in dry, open habitats like grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
