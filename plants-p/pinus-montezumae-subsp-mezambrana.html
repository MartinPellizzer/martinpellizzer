<p>Pinus montezumae subsp.</p>
<p>mezambrana, commonly known as the Mexican bristle pine, is a subspecies of the Mexican pine native to high-altitude regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive bristle-like cones and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of other pine species.</p>
<p>The tree thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in cloud forests. Its cones mature over several years and release seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays an important role in the ecological systems of its native habitat.</p>
