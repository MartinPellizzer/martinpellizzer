                    <h1>Paspalum longicuspe</h1>
<p>Paspalum longicuspe, commonly known as the long-beaked paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Paspalum longicuspe is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
