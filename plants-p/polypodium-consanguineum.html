<p>Polypodium consanguineum, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water sources. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, making it a common sight in humid, tropical climates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
