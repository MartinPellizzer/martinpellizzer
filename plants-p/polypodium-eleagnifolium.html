<p>Polypodium eleagnifolium, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are evergreen, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The silver fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
