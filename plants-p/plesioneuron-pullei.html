                    <h1>Plesioneuron pullei</h1>
<p>Plesioneuron pullei, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Huperjiaceae and is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones rather than flowers, making it a primitive vascular plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists studying ancient plant lineages.</p>
