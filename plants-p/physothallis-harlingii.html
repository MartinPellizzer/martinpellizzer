                    <h1>Physothallis harlingii</h1>
<p>Physothallis harlingii, commonly known as the Harling's tuckahoe, is a rare and endangered species of fern that belongs to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often curved fronds that are covered in dense, velvety scales. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can thrive in low light conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Physothallis harlingii is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
