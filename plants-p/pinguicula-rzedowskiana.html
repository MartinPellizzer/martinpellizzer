                    <h1>Pinguicula rzedowskiana</h1>
<p>Pinguicula rzedowskiana, commonly known as the Rzedowskiana butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces a single, bell-shaped flower with violet petals, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
