                            <h1>Phacelia Californica Var. Virgata</h1>
<p>Bluecurls, scientifically known as Phacelia californica var. virgata, is a striking wildflower native to the coastal regions of California. Its name comes from the curling blue petals that form delicate, spiraling clusters at the ends of its stems. This plant thrives in sandy soils and coastal dunes, often blooming in late spring and early summer. With its vibrant blue color and unique floral structure, it plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Despite its beauty, Bluecurls is threatened by habitat loss and invasive species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
