                    <h1>Perrierangraecum rigidifolium</h1>
<p>Perrierangraecum rigidifolium, commonly known as the rigid-leaf rock heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its tough, rigid leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
