<p>Pedicellaria triphylla, commonly known as the three-lobed pedicellaria, is a species of sea star found in shallow marine environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed structure, which is part of its unique pedicellaria, a type of defensive organ used to deter predators. The plant's body is typically covered in fine, spiny projections that aid in attachment to rocky substrates. It thrives in temperate coastal regions and is often found in association with other marine invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of intertidal ecosystems.</p>
