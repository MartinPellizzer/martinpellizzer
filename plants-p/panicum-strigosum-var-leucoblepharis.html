<p>Panicum strigosum var. leucoblepharis, commonly known as silverleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with spikelets that are often pale to whitish in color.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
