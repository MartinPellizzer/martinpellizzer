<p>Phalaris avicularis, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, ditches, and pond margins. The plant has slender,丛生 (tufted) stems that often form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow with a distinctive waxy coating. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Phalaris avicularis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
