<p>Photinia serrulata var. aculeata, commonly known as the serrated photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and seasonal color changes.</p>
