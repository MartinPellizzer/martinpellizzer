                    <h1>Pinus rudis</h1>
<p>Pinus rudis, commonly known as the coastal pine, is a species of pine native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of other pine species. The cones of Pinus rudis are small and usually open, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This plant is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments.</p>
<p>Its resilience to coastal conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
