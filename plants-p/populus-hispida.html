                    <h1>Populus hispida</h1>
<p>Populus hispida, commonly known as the hispid poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and lanceolate leaves that are hairy on both sides, giving it a distinctive texture. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Populus hispida is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky environments.</p>
