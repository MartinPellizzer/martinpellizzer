                    <h1>Pteris stipulacea</h1>
<p>Pteris stipulacea, commonly known as the creeping water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water sources such as streams or ponds. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats that help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
