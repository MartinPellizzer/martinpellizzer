                    <h1>Phalacraea coelestina</h1>
<p>Phalacraea coelestina, commonly known as the sky-blue star-of-Bethlehem, is a striking member of the Asparagaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is considered rare in the wild.</p>
