                    <h1>Prunus arborea var. stipulacea</h1>
<p>Prunus arborea var. stipulacea, commonly known as the stipulate cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive leaves, which have stipulesâ€”small, leaf-like structures at the base of the leaf stalk. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in spring, followed by edible, cherry-like fruits that are typically red or black when mature.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and ornamental gardening.</p>
