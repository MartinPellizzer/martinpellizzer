                    <h1>Plantago major var. microstachya</h1>
<p>Plantago major var. microstachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a dense spike, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens.</p>
<p>This variety is similar to the common plantain but has narrower leaves and a more compact growth habit.</p>
