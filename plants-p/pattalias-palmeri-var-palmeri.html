                    <h1>Pattalias palmeri var. palmeri</h1>
<p>Pattalias palmeri var. palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's pincushion cactus, is a succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny clusters of stems that form a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
