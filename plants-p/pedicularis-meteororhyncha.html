                    <h1>Pedicularis meteororhyncha</h1>
<p>Pedicularis meteororhyncha, commonly known as the skyrocket lousewort, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants, while still performing photosynthesis. Native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas, it thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. The plant features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
