<p>Paeonia corallina subsp.</p>
<p>atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic coral peony, is a rare and striking plant native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its vibrant coral-pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils along the shoreline, adapting to the harsh maritime environment. Its subspecies status reflects its distinct ecological and morphological traits compared to other paeony species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
