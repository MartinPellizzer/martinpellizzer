<p>Pothos microphyllus, commonly known as the marble queen pothos, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, variegated leaves that feature a striking combination of cream, green, and yellow patterns. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its aerial roots allow it to climb and attach to surfaces, which is a key feature of its climbing habit.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically small to medium in size, hence the species name "microphyllus," meaning "small leaf.".</p>
