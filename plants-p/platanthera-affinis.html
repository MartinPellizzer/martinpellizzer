                    <h1>Platanthera affinis</h1>
<p>Platanthera affinis, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to moist, shaded habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy white or greenish-white flower. The plant is epiphytic in some regions, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a key aspect of its botanical ecology.</p>
<p>The species is relatively small, typically reaching heights of 10–20 centimeters.</p>
