<p>Paepalanthus pedunculatus, commonly known as the giant marsh orchid, is a striking plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in marshy and swampy environments, often forming dense clusters along the edges of water bodies. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged soil, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions.</p>
