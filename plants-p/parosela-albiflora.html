<p>Parosela albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered parosela, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle beauty to its alpine habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Parosela albiflora is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
