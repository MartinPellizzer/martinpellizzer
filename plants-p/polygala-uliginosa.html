                    <h1>Polygala uliginosa</h1>
<p>Polygala uliginosa, commonly known as the marsh milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, often hairy stems that grow from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical spikes, which are characteristic of the genus Polygala. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and typically lance-shaped, with a rough texture.</p>
<p>Polygala uliginosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
