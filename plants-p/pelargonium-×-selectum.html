<p>Pelargonium × selectum, commonly known as the ivy-leaf geranium, is a hybrid plant in the Geraniaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and dark green, slightly serrated leaves that resemble ivy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its compact growth.</p>
<p>Pelargonium × selectum is relatively drought-tolerant and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
