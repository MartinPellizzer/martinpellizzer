                    <h1>Phragmites caudatus</h1>
<p>Phragmites caudatus, commonly known as common reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of feathery, spike-like flowers. This plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and filtering water due to its extensive root system. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in marshes, estuaries, and along lake shores.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive.</p>
