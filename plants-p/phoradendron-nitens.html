                    <h1>Phoradendron nitens</h1>
<p>Phoradendron nitens, commonly known as the silver mist mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and white, waxy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are a food source for birds, which in turn aid in seed dispersal. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The silver mist mistletoe is an important component of forest ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity through its interactions with host trees and wildlife.</p>
