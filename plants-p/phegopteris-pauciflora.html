<p>Phegopteris pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered along the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Phegopteris pauciflora plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
