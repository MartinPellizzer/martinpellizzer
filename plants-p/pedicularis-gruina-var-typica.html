<p>Pedicularis gruina var. typica, commonly known as the golden monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble the fur of a golden monkey. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in botanical studies.</p>
