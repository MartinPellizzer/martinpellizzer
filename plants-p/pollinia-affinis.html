                    <h1>Pollinia affinis</h1>
<p>Pollinia affinis, commonly known as the orchid bee pollinia, is a unique structure found in certain orchid species.</p>
<p>It consists of a mass of pollen grains encapsulated in a sticky, gelatinous matrix. This specialized structure is adapted for epentaphonic pollination, where the pollinia are transferred from one flower to another by insects. The pollinia affinis is typically attached to the stigma or anthers of the orchid flower.</p>
<p>Its morphology and function are closely tied to the specific pollination strategies of the host orchid species.</p>
