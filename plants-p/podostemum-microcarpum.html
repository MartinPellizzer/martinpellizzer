<p>Podostemum microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater streams and rivers, where it attaches itself to rocks using its specialized roots. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often submerged, with tiny, clustered flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release minute seeds into the water.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
