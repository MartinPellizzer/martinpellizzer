<p>Pteris incisa f. rugosa, commonly known as the rugose water fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bi- to tri-pinnate, with a serrated or toothed margin that gives the plant its rugged appearance. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps them retain moisture in moist environments. It thrives in shady, damp areas and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
