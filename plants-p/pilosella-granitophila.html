<p>Pilosella granitophila, commonly known as the granitic pilosella, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in alpine and subalpine environments. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers with hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
