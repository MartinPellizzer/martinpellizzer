                    <h1>Poa dependens</h1>
<p>Poa dependens, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, soft blades that often curl at the tips. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Poa dependens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its dense, carpet-like growth.</p>
