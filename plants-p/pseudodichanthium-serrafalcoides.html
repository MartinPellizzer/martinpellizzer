                    <h1>Pseudodichanthium serrafalcoides</h1>
<p>Pseudodichanthium serrafalcoides, commonly known as the serrated speargrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is occasionally used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
