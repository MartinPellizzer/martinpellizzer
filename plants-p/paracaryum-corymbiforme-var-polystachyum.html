<p>Paracaryum corymbiforme var. polystachyum, commonly known as the giant water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, and it produces dense clusters of violet-blue flowers.

Its rapid growth rate makes it an effective natural water purifier, though it can become invasive if not managed.</p>
