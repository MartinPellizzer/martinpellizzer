                    <h1>Pollinia imberbis f. monostachya</h1>
<p>Pollinia imberbis f. monostachya, commonly known as the single-stemmed orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species characterized by its unique floral structure.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is distinguished by its elongated, hairless pollinia, which are typically attached to a single stamen. The plant exhibits a monostachya habit, meaning it produces a single, elongated inflorescence with a series of flowers. Its botanical features are adapted for specific pollination mechanisms, often involving mycorrhizal relationships with fungi.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in certain tropical regions.</p>
