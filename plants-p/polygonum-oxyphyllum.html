<p>Polygonum oxyphyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed smartweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, pink to red flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Polygonum oxyphyllum is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of wetland health.</p>
