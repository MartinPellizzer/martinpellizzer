<p>Platorheedia, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits.</p>
<p>Platorheedia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
