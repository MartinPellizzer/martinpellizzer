                    <h1>Poa seorsa</h1>
<p>Poa seorsa, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, which allows it to thrive in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions.</p>
<p>Poa seorsa is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
