                    <h1>Placus crinitus</h1>
<p>Placus crinitus, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic animals. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, where it uses its specialized organs to supplement its nutrient intake. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which aid in trapping prey.</p>
<p>The plant reproduces both sexually through seeds and vegetatively through runners, allowing it to spread in suitable habitats.</p>
