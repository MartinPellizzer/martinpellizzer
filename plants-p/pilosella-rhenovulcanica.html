                    <h1>Pilosella rhenovulcanica</h1>
<p>Pilosella rhenovulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic pilosella, is a rare flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers, and its hairy, gray-green leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or disturbed habitats. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying adaptive evolution.</p>
<p>Pilosella rhenovulcanica is also noted for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions, including volcanic soils and extreme temperatures.</p>
