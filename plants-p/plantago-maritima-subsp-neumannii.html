<p>Plantago maritima subsp.</p>
<p>neumannii, commonly known as the coastal plantain, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in a spike and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to harsh coastal environments and plays a role in stabilizing dune systems.</p>
