<p>Potamogeton natans subsp.</p>
<p>polygonifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater ecosystems in North America. It has long, cylindrical stems that grow from the bottom of water bodies and produce dense clusters of small, green, elongated leaves.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its broad, polygonal-shaped leaves, which distinguish it from other pondweed species. It plays an important role in aquatic habitats by providing shelter for fish and invertebrates.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in slow-moving rivers, lakes, and ponds with soft, muddy substrates.</p>
