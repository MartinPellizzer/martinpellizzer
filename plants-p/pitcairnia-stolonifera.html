                    <h1>Pitcairnia stolonifera</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with vibrant, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread horizontally, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
