<p>Pneumatopteris excisa, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, feathery appearance with delicate, branching structures that aid in gas exchange. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in swampy areas.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically green and have a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss and facilitate photosynthesis.</p>
