<p>Parosela californica var. simplifolia, commonly known as the California parosela, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species of coastal prairie ecosystems.</p>
