                            <h1>Phyllogeiton Zeyheri</h1>
<p>Phyllogeiton zeyheri is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the humid lowland forests of western Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. This species is distinguished by its striking, velvety leaves that shimmer under the forest canopy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered. Conservation efforts are urgently needed to protect this unique flora from further decline.</p>
