                    <h1>Polypodium prasinum</h1>
<p>Polypodium prasinum, commonly known as the emerald moss, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth habit and bright green fronds that are often covered in a waxy coating. This plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its rhizomes form a network that helps anchor it to surfaces and absorb nutrients from the surrounding substrate.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
