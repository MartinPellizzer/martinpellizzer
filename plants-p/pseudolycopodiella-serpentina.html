                    <h1>Pseudolycopodiella serpentina</h1>
<p>Pseudolycopodiella serpentina, commonly known as the snake moss, is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Huperjiaceae and is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit. The plant produces sporangia on specialized leaves called sporophylls, which are typically arranged in clusters. Its reproductive structures are often concealed beneath a layer of moss-like foliage, making it difficult to spot.</p>
<p>Pseudolycopodiella serpentina is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in forested areas.</p>
