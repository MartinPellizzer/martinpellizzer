                    <h1>Panicum martianum</h1>
<p>Panicum martianum, commonly known as Martian grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is adapted to survive in poor soils and can thrive in environments with low water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used for erosion control and as a forage plant in livestock systems.</p>
