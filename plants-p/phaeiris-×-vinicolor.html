                    <h1>Phaeiris × vinicolor</h1>
<p>Phaeiris × vinicolor, commonly known as the hybrid phaeiris, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Phaeiris caerulea and Phaeiris carpathica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet to purple foliage, which is a result of its genetic inheritance from both parent species. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub with dense, broad leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its unique leaf coloration and ease of care.</p>
