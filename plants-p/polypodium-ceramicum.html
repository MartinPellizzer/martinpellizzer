                    <h1>Polypodium ceramicum</h1>
<p>Polypodium ceramicum, commonly known as the ceramic fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, serrated segments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fertile fronds, a characteristic common among ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
