                            <h1>Pulsatilla Albana Subsp. Violacea</h1>
<p>Alpine pasqueflower, scientifically known as Pulsatilla albana subsp. violacea, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It blooms in early spring, often before the snow has fully melted, making it a symbol of resilience and renewal in harsh environments. The plant is characterized by its showy, violet-colored flowers and hairy, waxy leaves that help it retain heat and moisture. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered vulnerable to climate change and habitat loss. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure its survival in the wild.</p>
