<p>Poa araratica subsp.</p>
<p>altior, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green blades that are often covered in a whitish bloom.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing forage for wildlife and contributing to soil health.</p>
