<p>Pimelea aquilonia, commonly known as the mountain banksia, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking, cone-like inflorescences that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are primarily pollinated by nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Pimelea aquilonia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest.</p>
