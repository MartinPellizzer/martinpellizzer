<p>Polypodium polypodioides var. michauxianum, commonly known as the Michaux's polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are arranged in lines along the veins. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>The varietal form michauxianum is distinguished by its slightly different frond morphology and habitat preferences compared to the typical form.</p>
