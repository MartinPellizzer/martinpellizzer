<p>Paspalum anemotum, commonly known as the windgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often rolled at the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as prairies and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Paspalum anemotum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments.</p>
