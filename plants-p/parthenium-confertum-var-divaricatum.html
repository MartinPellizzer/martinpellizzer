                    <h1>Parthenium confertum var. divaricatum</h1>
<p>Parthenium confertum var. divaricatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf horseweed, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairie and open woodland habitats. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
