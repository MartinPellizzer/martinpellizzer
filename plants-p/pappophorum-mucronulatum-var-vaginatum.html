<p>Pappophorum mucronulatum var. vaginatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet soils in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, triangular stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly folded. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, aiding in its spread.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates.</p>
