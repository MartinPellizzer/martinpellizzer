                    <h1>Paraquilegia gemmifolia</h1>
<p>Paraquilegia gemmifolia, commonly known as the gemmiferous paraquilegia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences of small, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, while its stems are often hairy.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its unique reproductive strategy, producing gemmae—small vegetative propagules—that allow it to spread efficiently in its native habitat.</p>
