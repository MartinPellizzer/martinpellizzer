<p>Poa tatarica, commonly known as Tatarian grass, is a species of grass native to eastern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Poa tatarica is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
