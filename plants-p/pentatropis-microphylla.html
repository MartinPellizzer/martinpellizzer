                    <h1>Pentatropis microphylla</h1>
<p>Pentatropis microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved five-branch pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, twisted branches and small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces distinctive cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of conifers. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and adaptation to extreme environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
