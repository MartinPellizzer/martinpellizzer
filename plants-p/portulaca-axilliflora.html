<p>Portulaca axilliflora, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, succulent plant with fleshy, thick stems and leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Portulaca axilliflora is well adapted to sandy soils and salty air, making it a hardy species found in coastal dunes and other harsh environments.</p>
