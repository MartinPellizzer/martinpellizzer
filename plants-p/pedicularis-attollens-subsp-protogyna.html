<p>Pedicularis attollens subsp.</p>
<p>protogyna, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow floral bracts. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while photosynthesizing independently.</p>
<p>Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are often mistaken for leaves, a feature that aids in its camouflage.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a notable subject in botanical studies.</p>
