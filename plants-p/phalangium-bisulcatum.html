<p>Phalangium bisulcatum, commonly known as the two-ridged flatback millipede, is a species of millipede characterized by its elongated, segmented body and numerous legs.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polydesmidae and is native to regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The exoskeleton of this millipede is typically dark in color, often appearing black or dark brown, with distinct ridges along its body. It plays a role in soil aeration and decomposition, contributing to nutrient cycling in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its cryptic behavior, it is rarely seen and is more active during the night.</p>
