                    <h1>Potentilla × diversifolia</h1>
<p>Potentilla × diversifolia, commonly known as the variable cinquefoil, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its diverse leaf morphology, with leaves that can be ovate, elliptic, or even lobed, depending on the environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in the spring, which are typical of the Rosaceae family. Its adaptability to various soil types and climates makes it a resilient species in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>The botanical variability of Potentilla × diversifolia has led to its classification as a species complex rather than a single, distinct species.</p>
