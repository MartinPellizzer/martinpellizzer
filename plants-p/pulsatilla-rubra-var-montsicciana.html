                    <h1>Pulsatilla rubra var. montsicciana</h1>
<p>Pulsatilla rubra var. montsicciana, commonly known as the Montsiccian pasqueflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high alpine regions of the Pyrenees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to the cold, rocky environments it inhabits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and slopes at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
