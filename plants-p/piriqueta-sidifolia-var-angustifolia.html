<p>Piriqueta sidifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved piriqueta, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The leaves are linear and narrow, typically measuring up to 5 centimeters in length, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, pale blue or purple flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming during the cooler months.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
