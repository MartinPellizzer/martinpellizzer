                    <h1>Pattara</h1>
<p>Pattara, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, still water environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, ribbon-like leaves that resemble ghostly tendrils, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf surfaces, adapting to low-nutrient aquatic conditions. It is often found in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams, where it contributes to the ecosystem by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its delicate structure and unusual appearance make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
