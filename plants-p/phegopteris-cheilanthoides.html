<p>Phegopteris cheilanthoides, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern with delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called indusia.</p>
<p>The rock polypody is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
