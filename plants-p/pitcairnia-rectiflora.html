                    <h1>Pitcairnia rectiflora</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia rectiflora, commonly known as the straight-flowered pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cup, a common feature among bromeliads. The plant produces striking, elongated inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Pitcairnia rectiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
