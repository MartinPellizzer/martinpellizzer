                    <h1>Phyllodoce × hybrida</h1>
<p>Phyllodoce × hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, shiny, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in cold, moist environments. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, which are typically white or pale pink and are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas.</p>
<p>Phyllodoce × hybrida is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or wetland habitats.</p>
