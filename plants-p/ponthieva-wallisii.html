                    <h1>Ponthieva wallisii</h1>
<p>Ponthieva wallisii, commonly known as the Wallis's cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a tropical climate with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat loss, Ponthieva wallisii is considered vulnerable to extinction.</p>
