<p>Pulmonaria tridentina, commonly known as the three-lobed lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Saxifragaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Europe and is characterized by its distinctive, spotted leaves that resemble lung tissue, hence its common name.

<p>Pulmonaria tridentina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in cooler climates.</p>
