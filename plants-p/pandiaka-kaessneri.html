<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep red. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. Its leaves are elliptical and have a glossy texture, while its flowering period occurs during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pandiaka kaessneri is considered a conservation concern.</p>
