<p>Picea kukunaria, commonly known as the Kukushka spruce, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like foliage. The tree produces small, pale yellow cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, typically found on the female plants. Its bark is thin and reddish-brown, becoming rougher with age, and it prefers well-drained, acidic soils in cool, moist climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
