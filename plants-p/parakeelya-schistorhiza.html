                    <h1>Parakeelya schistorhiza</h1>
<p>Parakeelya schistorhiza, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wetlands of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white, ghost-like flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has no leaves and relies entirely on its roots for survival, which are adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged soil. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection.</p>
