                    <h1>Poa insolita</h1>
<p>Poa insolita, commonly known as the rare grass of the Andes, is a perennial species native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
<p>Its botanical study contributes to understanding plant adaptation to extreme environmental conditions.</p>
