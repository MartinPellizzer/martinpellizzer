                    <h1>Phoradendron rubrum var. latifolium</h1>
<p>Phoradendron rubrum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It possesses a smooth, waxy, evergreen foliage with elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically 2â€“6 cm in length. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Its growth is slow and it relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The species is also known for its role in ecological systems, supporting various insect and bird populations.</p>
