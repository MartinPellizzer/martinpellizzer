<p>Pentalepis walcottii, commonly known as the Walcott's pincushion, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiky inflorescence that resembles a pincushion, composed of numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pentalepis walcottii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
