<p>Pisum commune subsp.</p>
<p>arvense, commonly known as field pea, is a wild legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves, with small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink.</p>
<p>The plant produces cylindrical pods containing several elliptical seeds, which are typically brown or gray in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>This subspecies is less commonly cultivated than its domesticated relatives but is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation.</p>
