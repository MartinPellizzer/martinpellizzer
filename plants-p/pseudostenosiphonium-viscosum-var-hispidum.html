                    <h1>Pseudostenosiphonium viscosum var. hispidum</h1>
<p>Pseudostenosiphonium viscosum var. hispidum, commonly known as the hairy sticky moss, is a variant of the sticky moss species characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant's leaves are elongated and often covered with a sticky substance, which aids in water retention and deterring herbivores. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its adaptability to humid climates and its role in soil stabilization in its native habitats.</p>
