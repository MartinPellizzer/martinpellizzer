                    <h1>Pueraria</h1>
<p>Pueraria, commonly known as kudzu, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vigorous growth and climbing habit, with trifoliate leaves and showy purple or white flowers. The plant is native to East Asia but has been introduced to other regions, where it can become an invasive species. Pueraria species are often used in traditional medicine and for soil nitrogen fixation due to their ability to form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
<p>Its roots contain compounds that have been studied for potential pharmaceutical applications.</p>
