<p>Platanthera chlorantha subsp.</p>
<p>orientalis, commonly known as the oriental yellow twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
