<p>Cuspidate psychotria, scientifically known as Psychotria cuspidata var. genuina, is a rare and striking plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. This evergreen shrub belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. Its most notable feature is its vivid red and orange flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract a variety of pollinators. The plant is also recognized for its medicinal properties, with traditional uses in indigenous communities for treating ailments. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
