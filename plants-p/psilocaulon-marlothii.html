                    <h1>Psilocaulon marlothii</h1>
<p>Psilocaulon marlothii, commonly known as the Marloth's ghost flower, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape Province. The plant is characterized by its unique, umbrella-like inflorescence composed of numerous small, pale blue or white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Psilocaulon marlothii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
