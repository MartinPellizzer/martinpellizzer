                    <h1>Pholidostachys dactyloides</h1>
<p>Pholidostachys dactyloides, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has a dense, mat-forming growth habit with short, stiff leaves and produces small, pale green flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. It is often used for erosion control and livestock forage due to its hardiness and rapid growth.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
