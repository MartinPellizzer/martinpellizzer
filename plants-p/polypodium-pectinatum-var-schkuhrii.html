<p>Polypodium pectinatum var. schkuhrii, commonly known as the Schkuhriâ€™s cliff fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately compound fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, humid environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
