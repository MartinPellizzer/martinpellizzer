<p>Pecteilis rawatii, commonly known as the Himalayan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or gravelly soils, and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
