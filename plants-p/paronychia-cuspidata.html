                    <h1>Paronychia cuspidata</h1>
<p>Paronychia cuspidata, commonly known as the sharp-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky areas or along coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Paronychia cuspidata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance.</p>
