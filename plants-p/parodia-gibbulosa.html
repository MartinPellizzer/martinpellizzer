<p>Parodia gibbulosa, commonly known as the "Cactus of the Gods," is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, thick stems covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its stem and having a shallow root system.</p>
<p>Parodia gibbulosa is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
