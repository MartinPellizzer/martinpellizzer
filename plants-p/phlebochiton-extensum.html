                    <h1>Phlebochiton extensum</h1>
<p>Phlebochiton extensum, commonly known as the broad-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which attach to the host's vascular system. It produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
