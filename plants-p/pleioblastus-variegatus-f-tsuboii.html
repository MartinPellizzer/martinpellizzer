                    <h1>Pleioblastus variegatus f. tsuboii</h1>
<p>Pleioblastus variegatus f. tsuboii, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a compact, clumping bamboo that exhibits striking variegated foliage.</p>
<p>Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and display a combination of green, white, and yellow hues, creating a visually appealing contrast. The plant thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. It is native to Japan and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in both indoor and outdoor settings.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and dense foliage, it is an excellent choice for erosion control and as a groundcover in shaded areas.</p>
