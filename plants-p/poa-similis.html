                    <h1>Poa similis</h1>
<p>Poa similis, commonly known as the similar bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, often tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Poa similis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse insect populations.</p>
