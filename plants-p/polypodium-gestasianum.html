<p>Polypodium gestasianum, commonly known as the Gestaian fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in distinct patterns.</p>
<p>Polypodium gestasianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
