                    <h1>Phalaris aquatica</h1>
<p>Phalaris aquatica, commonly known as marsh grass or watergrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, greenish-white flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to aquatic conditions, often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
