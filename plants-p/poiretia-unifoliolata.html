<p>Poiretia unifoliolata, commonly known as the single leaf poiretia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, elongated leaf that emerges directly from the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
