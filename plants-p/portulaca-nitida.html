<p>Portulaca nitida, commonly known as the silver carpet plant, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the variety. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Portulaca nitida is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
