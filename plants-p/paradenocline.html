<p>Paradenocline, commonly known as the coastal dune grass, is a plant species adapted to thrive in sandy, coastal environments.</p>
<p>It has a deep root system that helps stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that allow it to colonize new areas quickly. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Paradenocline plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of coastal ecosystems.</p>
