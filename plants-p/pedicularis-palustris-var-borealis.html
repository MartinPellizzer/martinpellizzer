                    <h1>Pedicularis palustris var. borealis</h1>
<p>Pedicularis palustris var. borealis, commonly known as the northern marsh lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in tundra and wet meadow habitats. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are opposite and often have a reddish or purple hue, which helps it withstand cold temperatures.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range.</p>
