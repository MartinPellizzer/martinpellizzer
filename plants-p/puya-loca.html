<p>Puya loca, commonly known as the "mad puya," is a striking member of the bromeliad family native to the Andean highlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stalk and large, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bloom in a range of vibrant hues, from red to orange and yellow. Puya loca is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, dry conditions with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
