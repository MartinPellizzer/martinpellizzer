                    <h1>Pedicularis graeca</h1>
<p>Pedicularis graeca, commonly known as the Greek lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its bilaterally symmetrical, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>The unique floral structure of Pedicularis graeca attracts specific pollinators, such as bees and flies, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
