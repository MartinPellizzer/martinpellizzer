                    <h1>Pleurostachys densifoliata</h1>
<p>Pleurostachys densifoliata, commonly known as the dense-leaved mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, overlapping foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and坚韧, with a thick, waxy cuticle that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>This species is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
