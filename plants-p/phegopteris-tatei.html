                    <h1>Phegopteris tatei</h1>
<p>Phegopteris tatei, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically green and float on the water, with some leaves submerged. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>Phegopteris tatei plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality regulation.</p>
