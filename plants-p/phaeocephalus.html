                    <h1>Phaeocephalus</h1>
<p>Phaeocephalus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, leafless appearance and its ability to grow epiphytically on trees, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant's flowers are typically white or pale green, with a strikingly elegant structure that resembles a ghostly silhouette. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Phaeocephalus is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts.</p>
