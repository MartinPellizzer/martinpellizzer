                    <h1>Pachystela albida</h1>
<p>Pachystela albida, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white, translucent petals and sepals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic, and it relies on specific humidity and light conditions for survival. Its flowers are typically small and delicate, blooming in clusters during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and its elusive nature, Pachystela albida is considered endangered and is rarely seen in the wild.</p>
