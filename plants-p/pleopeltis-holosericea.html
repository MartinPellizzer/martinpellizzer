<p>Pleopeltis holosericea, commonly known as the silky pleated fern, is a tropical epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The leaves are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like structure that contributes to its ornamental appeal.</p>
