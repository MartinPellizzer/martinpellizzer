                    <h1>Psathyrostachys</h1>
<p>Psathyrostachys, commonly known as goat grass, is a genus of grasses native to Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. They typically grow in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Psathyrostachys species are often used in ecological restoration due to their hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Some species are also studied for their potential in biofuel production and as model plants for wheat genetics.</p>
