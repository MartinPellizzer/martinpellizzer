                    <h1>Pedicularis lasiantha</h1>
<p>Pedicularis lasiantha, commonly known as the large-leaved lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often resembling those of snapdragons. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
