                    <h1>Polyalthia castanea</h1>
<p>Polyalthia castanea, commonly known as the hill teak or hill ebony, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and long, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, chestnut-like fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a significant species in traditional timber industries.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered vulnerable in many regions.</p>
