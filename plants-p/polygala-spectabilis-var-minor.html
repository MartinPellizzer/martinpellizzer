<p>Polygala spectabilis var. minor, commonly known as the lesser fairy-flower, is a flowering plant native to parts of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with slender, erect stems and small, delicate flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color. The plant produces specialized structures called verticillate inflorescences, which consist of whorls of flowers arranged around a central axis. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
