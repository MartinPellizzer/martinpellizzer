                    <h1>Pinus sylvestris var. baenitzii</h1>
<p>Pinus sylvestris var. baenitzii, commonly known as the Scots pine subspecies Baenitzii, is a variant of the Scots pine native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and conical shape, adapted to harsh alpine conditions. The needles are typically longer and more rigid compared to other pine varieties, and the cones are small and woody. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in subalpine and alpine zones.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts in its native habitat.</p>
