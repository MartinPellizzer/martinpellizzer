                    <h1>Phreatia stenostachya</h1>
<p>Phreatia stenostachya, commonly known as the narrow-stalked ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a slender, leafless stem and a single, elongated flower spike. The plant typically grows epiphytically on trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with intricate, lip-like structures that aid in pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Phreatia stenostachya is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
