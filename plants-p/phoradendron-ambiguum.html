                    <h1>Phoradendron ambiguum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron ambiguum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas.</p>
<p>It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often consumed by birds, facilitating seed dispersal. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a waxy surface, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Phoradendron ambiguum plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
