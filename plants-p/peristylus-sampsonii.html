<p>Peristylus sampsonii, commonly known as the Sampson's peristylus, is a flowering plant native to the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that typically grows in rocky, coastal areas, adapting to the harsh maritime climate. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, providing year-round foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Peristylus sampsonii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
