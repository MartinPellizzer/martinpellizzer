                    <h1>Pachypodium rosulatum var. inopinatum</h1>
<p>Pachypodium rosulatum var. inopinatum, commonly known as the "Star Tree" or "Cork Tree," is a unique succulent native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, woody stem and a crown of spiny, paddle-shaped leaves that resemble a star. The plant produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are clustered in inflorescences at the base of the stem. Its succulent nature allows it to store water in its stem and leaves, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
