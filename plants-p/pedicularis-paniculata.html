                    <h1>Pedicularis paniculata</h1>
<p>Pedicularis paniculata, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Pedicularis, which is part of the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family. This species is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that resemble small monkeys, hence its common name. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or open areas.</p>
<p>The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on other plants for nutrients through its root system.</p>
