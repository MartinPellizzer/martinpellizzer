                    <h1>Poa depressa</h1>
<p>Poa depressa, commonly known as the bentgrass or creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often found in moist, well-drained soils such as those in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curled at the tips, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is valued in horticulture for its fine texture and ability to form a dense turf, making it suitable for lawns and golf courses.</p>
<p>Poa depressa is also an important component of many native plant communities, contributing to soil stabilization and biodiversity.</p>
