                    <h1>Paraprasophyllum niphopedium</h1>
<p>Paraprasophyllum niphopedium, commonly known as the snow cushion, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, adapted to retain moisture and withstand freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss.</p>
