<p>Polylepis quadrijuga var. parcipila, commonly known as the Andean wax tree, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive thick, waxy leaves that help it survive in cold and dry environments. This shrub or small tree typically grows at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 meters, where it forms dense thickets. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually yellow or green, and it produces small, hard-coated seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
