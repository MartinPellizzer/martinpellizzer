<p>Puya pearcei, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 10 feet in height. The plant features broad, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a dense, water-holding structure at the base. Puya pearcei produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range.</p>
