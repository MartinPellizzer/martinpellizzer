<p>Pontederia crassicaulis, commonly known as pickerelweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in dense spikes, typically from late spring to early fall. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water repellence. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Pickerelweed is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in shallow water and its ecological benefits.</p>
