                    <h1>Phyllopodium rangei</h1>
<p>Phyllopodium rangei, commonly known as the rangei phyllopod, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology.</p>
<p>It features broad, flat, leaf-like structures called phylloplodes, which are arranged in a fan-like pattern. These structures are not true leaves but are instead specialized photosynthetic organs adapted to low-light environments. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized growth requirements, Phyllopodium rangei is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
