<p>Potamobryon concinnum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water moss, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Fontinaliaceae.</p>
<p>It is typically found in freshwater environments such as streams and ponds, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. The plant has filamentous, branching structures with narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often less than 1 millimeter in width. It reproduces through the production of spores, which are released into the water and germinate into new plants.</p>
<p>Potamobryon concinnum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
