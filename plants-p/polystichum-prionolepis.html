                    <h1>Polystichum prionolepis</h1>
<p>Polystichum prionolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate forests of East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright clump. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered into sori covered by a protective indusium. Polystichum prionolepis thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories where it forms dense, low-growing colonies.</p>
<p>Its elegant foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in shaded landscapes.</p>
