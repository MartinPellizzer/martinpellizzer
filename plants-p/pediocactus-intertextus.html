<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a spiny, segmented stem that typically grows to a height of about 10 centimeters. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short, lateral shoots. Its dense, woolly covering helps to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
