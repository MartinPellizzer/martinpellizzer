                    <h1>Polypodium lyciifolium</h1>
<p>Polypodium lyciifolium, commonly known as the creeping polypody, is a fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered near the ground. The fronds are typically bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its woodland habitat. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
