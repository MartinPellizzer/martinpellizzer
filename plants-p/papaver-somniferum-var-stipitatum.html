                    <h1>Papaver somniferum var. stipitatum</h1>
<p>Papaver somniferum var. stipitatum, commonly known as the stipitate opium poppy, is a botanical variant of the opium poppy characterized by its distinctive stipitate (warty) nodes on the stem.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of the Mediterranean and Central Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a purple or pink hue. Its latex contains alkaloids such as morphine and codeine, making it both medicinally significant and subject to strict legal regulation.</p>
<p>Due to its potential for misuse, cultivation of this variety is heavily restricted in many countries.</p>
