                    <h1>Pholidota carnea var. parviflora</h1>
<p>Pholidota carnea var. parviflora, commonly known as the pink-flowered pholidota, is a variant of the pholidota genus native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its tropical habitat.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
