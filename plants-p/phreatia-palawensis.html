                    <h1>Phreatia palawensis</h1>
<p>Phreatia palawensis, commonly known as the Palau sky orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in mountainous areas. The plant features a short, stocky stem with fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its often moist but nutrient-poor habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
