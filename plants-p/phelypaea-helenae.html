<p>Phelypaea helenae, commonly known as the Helen's water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant has four leaflets arranged in a cross shape, which is a distinctive feature of the genus Phelypaea. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in shaded areas with soft, muddy substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
