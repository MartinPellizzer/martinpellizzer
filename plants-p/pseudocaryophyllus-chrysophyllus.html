<p>Pseudocaryophyllus chrysophyllus, commonly known as the golden leaf cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the growing season, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically small and modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry climates.</p>
