                    <h1>Polystichum × maderense</h1>
<p>Polystichum × maderense, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Polystichum acrostichum and Polystichum setiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant produces fertile spores on the underside of its fronds, which are typically found in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable offspring and relies on vegetative propagation for survival.</p>
