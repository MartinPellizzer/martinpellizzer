                    <h1>Prunus cerasus flore-pleno</h1>
<p>Prunus cerasus flore-pleno, commonly known as the double-flowered cherry, is a cultivar of the sweet cherry tree characterized by its dense, showy blooms.</p>
<p>It produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers that are double-petaled, giving it a more ornamental appearance compared to typical cherries. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters. Its foliage is dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to the abundant floral display.</p>
<p>The fruit, while edible, is generally smaller and less flavorful than standard cherries, making it more valued for ornamental purposes.</p>
