                    <h1>Psittacanthus holtonii</h1>
<p>Psittacanthus holtonii, commonly known as the Holton's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary history as a gymnosperm, showcasing adaptations to its tropical environment.</p>
