                            <h1>Packera Cymbalarioides</h1>
<p>Columbian buttercup, scientifically known as Packera cymbalarioides, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to the mountainous regions of western North America. This perennial plant is recognized for its vibrant yellow flowers and distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky soils and open meadows at high elevations. Despite its beauty, the Columbian buttercup is also a toxic plant, containing compounds that can be harmful if ingested. Its ecological role is significant, as it provides nectar for pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
