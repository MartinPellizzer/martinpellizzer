                    <h1>Pachyphyllum micranthum</h1>
<p>Pachyphyllum micranthum, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Pachyphyllum micranthum is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found growing on rocky outcrops.</p>
