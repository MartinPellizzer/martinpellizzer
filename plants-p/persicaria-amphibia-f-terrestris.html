                    <h1>Persicaria amphibia f. terrestris</h1>
<p>Persicaria amphibia f. terrestris, commonly known as the creeping smartweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five pinkish-red petals, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and are often submerged or partially submerged in water.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to moist soils and can thrive in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats.</p>
