<p>Polygonum campanulatum var. membranifolium, commonly known as the membranous-leaf beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The leaves are thin and membranous, giving the plant its specific variety name, and they often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of swamps.</p>
<p>This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed production.</p>
