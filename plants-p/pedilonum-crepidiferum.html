                    <h1>Pedilonum crepidiferum</h1>
<p>Pedilonum crepidiferum, commonly known as the sandalwood vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and compound leaves that are often divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is often found in shaded, moist environments within rainforests.</p>
