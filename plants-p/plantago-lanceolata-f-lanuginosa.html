                    <h1>Plantago lanceolata f. lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Plantago lanceolata f. lanuginosa, commonly known as the hairy plantain, is a variant of the common plantain, characterized by its dense, soft, hairy covering on the leaves.</p>
<p>This feature distinguishes it from the typical form of Plantago lanceolata, which has smoother foliage. The plant is a perennial herb with a basal rosette of leaves and produces erect flowering stems that bear bracts and a cluster of small flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in roadsides, fields, and gardens.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is valued for its medicinal and ecological properties.</p>
