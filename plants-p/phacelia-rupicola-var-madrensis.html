                    <h1>Phacelia rupicola var. madrensis</h1>
<p>Phacelia rupicola var. madrensis, commonly known as the Madre√±a phacelia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
