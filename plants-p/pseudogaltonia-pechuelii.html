                    <h1>Pseudogaltonia pechuelii</h1>
<p>Pseudogaltonia pechuelii, commonly known as the Pechuel's cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, dark green, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
