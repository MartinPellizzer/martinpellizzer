                    <h1>Poa urubambensis</h1>
<p>Poa urubambensis, commonly known as the Urubamba grass, is a species of grass native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green blades that are adapted to cool, moist environments. The plant typically thrives in mountainous areas with well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
