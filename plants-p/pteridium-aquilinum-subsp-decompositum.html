<p>Pteridium aquilinum subsp.</p>
<p>decompositum, commonly known as the bracken fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal.</p>
<p>This subspecies is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, often outcompeting other vegetation.</p>
