                    <h1>Phlomis urticifolia</h1>
<p>Phlomis urticifolia, commonly known as rough hawksbeard, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and stiff, hairy leaves that give it a rough texture. The plant produces bright yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Its name "urticifolia" refers to the stinging, urticating hairs on its leaves, which can cause skin irritation.</p>
