<p>Piper marturetense f. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy piper, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Piperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage, which gives it its specific epithet "pilosum.". The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are elongated and have a rough texture, while its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes.</p>
<p>This fern-like plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
