<p>Phyllodes arrecta, commonly known as the erect phyllodes, is a species of acacia native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, leaf-like structures called phyllodes, which are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant typically grows in shrubland and woodland habitats, often forming dense thickets. Its phyllodes are usually straight or slightly curved, and they are covered in fine hairs that provide additional protection against drought.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a source of nectar for native pollinators.</p>
