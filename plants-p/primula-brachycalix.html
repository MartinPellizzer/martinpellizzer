                    <h1>Primula brachycalix</h1>
<p>Primula brachycalix, commonly known as the short-stalked primrose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The leaves are broadly ovate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to retain moisture in its alpine habitat. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Its blooming period occurs in early spring, making it a valuable addition to gardens that seek early-season color.</p>
