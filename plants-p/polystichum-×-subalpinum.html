<p>Polystichum × subalpinum, commonly known as the Alpine shield fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Polystichum acutifolium and Polystichum setiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with a dark green coloration and a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions and forest understories.</p>
<p>Polystichum × subalpinum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance.</p>
