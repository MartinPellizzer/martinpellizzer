                    <h1>Phoradendron dussii var. pauli</h1>
<p>Phoradendron dussii var. pauli, commonly known as the Pauli's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or pinkish berries that are consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It is an evergreen shrub that can form dense clusters on its host, often leading to the weakening of the tree over time.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role as both a parasite and a food source for wildlife.</p>
