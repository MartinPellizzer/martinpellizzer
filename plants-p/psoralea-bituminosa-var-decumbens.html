                    <h1>Psoralea bituminosa var. decumbens</h1>
<p>Psoralea bituminosa var. decumbens, commonly known as the black psoralea, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It has small, pinnately compound leaves with glandular hairs that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers arranged in dense spikes, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in small, leathery pods that split open when mature to release the seeds.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
