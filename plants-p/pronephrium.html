                    <h1>Pronephrium</h1>
<p>Pronephrium, commonly known as the primitive kidney-like structure in certain aquatic vertebrates.</p>
<p>It is a simple excretory organ composed of a network of tubules and a central cavity. The pronephrium functions in filtration and excretion, removing waste products from the bloodstream. It is typically found in early developmental stages of fish and some amphibians.</p>
<p>Unlike the more complex kidneys in higher vertebrates, the pronephrium lacks the specialized structures for urine concentration and regulation.</p>
