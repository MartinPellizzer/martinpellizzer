<p>Palmorchis maguirrei, commonly known as the Maguirre's orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the humid forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, delicate flower that typically blooms in the late spring or early summer. The plant has a short rhizome and produces a single, showy inflorescence with small, greenish-white petals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing near the forest floor.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
