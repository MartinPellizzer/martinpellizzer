<p>Picea engelmannii subsp.</p>
<p>engelmannii, commonly known as the Engelmann spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of other spruce species.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thin and reddish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to high elevations and cooler climates, often found in mountainous regions where it forms dense forests.</p>
