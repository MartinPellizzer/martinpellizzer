<p>Prospero idaeum, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, spiny leaves that provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
