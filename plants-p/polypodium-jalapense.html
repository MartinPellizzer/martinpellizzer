<p>Polypodium jalapense, commonly known as the Jalapense fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Central America and parts of the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces roots that anchor it to substrates like soil or rock.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
