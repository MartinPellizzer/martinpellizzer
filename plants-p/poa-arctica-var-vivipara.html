                    <h1>Poa arctica var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Poa arctica var. vivipara, commonly known as the Arctic grass or viviparous Arctic grass, is a perennial species native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a common component of tundra ecosystems. One of its notable features is its ability to produce viviparous shoots, which can take root and grow independently, aiding in its propagation.</p>
<p>This species plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small Arctic organisms.</p>
