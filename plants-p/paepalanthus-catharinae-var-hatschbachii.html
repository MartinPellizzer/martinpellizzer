                    <h1>Paepalanthus catharinae var. hatschbachii</h1>
<p>Paepalanthus catharinae var. hatschbachii, commonly known as the Hatschbach's candelabra cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that resemble a candelabra, covered in spiny, cylindrical segments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season, adding a vibrant contrast to its arid habitat. Native to the dry grasslands of southern Brazil, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation status.</p>
