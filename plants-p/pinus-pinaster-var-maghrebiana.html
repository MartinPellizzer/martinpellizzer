                    <h1>Pinus pinaster var. maghrebiana</h1>
<p>Pinus pinaster var. maghrebiana, commonly known as the Moroccan maritime pine, is a variant of the Spanish pine native to the Mediterranean region, particularly in North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically longer than those of the standard Pinus pinaster. The cones of this variety are often larger and more robust, containing edible seeds that are important for wildlife and human consumption. It thrives in coastal and mountainous areas, preferring well-drained soils and moderate climates.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its timber and ecological role in stabilizing coastal environments.</p>
