<p>Potentilla × collina var. tomentosa, commonly known as the silverleaf cinquefoil, is a low-growing, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, white hairs on the leaves and stems. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in early summer, which are clustered in corymbs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable plant for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
