<p>Phyllorkis gamblei, commonly known as the Gambier's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the eastern coast of Australia.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of eucalyptus and other host trees, forming a symbiotic relationship that provides it with some of its nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often inconspicuous, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough, textured surface.</p>
<p>Phyllorkis gamblei plays an important ecological role in its habitat by supporting various bird species that feed on its fruits.</p>
