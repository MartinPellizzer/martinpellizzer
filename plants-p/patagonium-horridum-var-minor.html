<p>Patagonium horridum var. minor, commonly known as the lesser horrid patagonium, is a perennial herb native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environments where it grows. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, often with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are usually narrow and pointed, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its resilience to cold and arid conditions, making it a hardy species in its native habitat.</p>
