                    <h1>Poa virginica</h1>
<p>Poa virginica, commonly known as coastal bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats in sandy or coastal soils. This plant is well adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a common sight in dunes and maritime environments. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Poa virginica plays an important ecological role in coastal habitats by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
