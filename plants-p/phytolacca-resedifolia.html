<p>Phytolacca resedifolia, commonly known as the red-rooted physic nut, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into fleshy, red berries containing toxic seeds. Its roots are thick and fleshy, which store nutrients and help the plant survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Phytolacca resedifolia is also known for its latex-like sap, which has been used in traditional medicine.</p>
