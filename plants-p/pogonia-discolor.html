                    <h1>Pogonia discolor</h1>
<p>Pogonia discolor, commonly known as the pink fairy-orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a short, hairy stem and lance-shaped leaves, and it typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is essential for its survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Pogonia discolor is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
