                    <h1>Polycarpon herniarioides</h1>
<p>Polycarpon herniarioides, commonly known as the creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, dry fruits called achenes. Its leaves are alternate, oval-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture.</p>
<p>Polycarpon herniarioides is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is considered a weed in some regions.</p>
