                    <h1>Pyrola urceolata</h1>
<p>Pyrola urceolata, commonly known as the urn-leafed wintergreen, is a herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dark green, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring. Its flowers are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps to retain moisture in its cool, moist habitats.</p>
<p>Pyrola urceolata is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
