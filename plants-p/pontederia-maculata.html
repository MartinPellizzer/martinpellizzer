<p>Pontederia maculata, commonly known as the purple rush or water hyssop, is a semi-aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features striking purple flowers that bloom in dense spikes, often emerging from water or moist soil. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in wetland environments. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a valuable ecological resource and a potential invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
