                    <h1>Plesioneuron rigidilobum</h1>
<p>Plesioneuron rigidilobum, commonly known as the rigid-lipped plesioneuron, is a member of the family Podostomaceae and is native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a semi-aquatic plant that typically grows along the edges of slow-moving freshwater streams and rivers. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, with distinctive, rigid lobes that help it anchor to rocky substrates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters, and it relies on aquatic pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of freshwater ecosystem health.</p>
