                    <h1>Platanthera chlorantha f. bracteata</h1>
<p>Platanthera chlorantha f. bracteata, commonly known as the bracted lady's-sock, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often obscured by leaf-like bracts. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
