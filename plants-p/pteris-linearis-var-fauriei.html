                    <h1>Pteris linearis var. fauriei</h1>
<p>Pteris linearis var. fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's water fern, is a variant of the common water fern.</p>
<p>It is a fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp forests. The plant has narrow, linear fronds that are often curled when young, which gradually unfurl as they mature. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green and have a delicate, feathery appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
