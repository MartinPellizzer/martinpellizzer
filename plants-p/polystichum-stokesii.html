                    <h1>Polystichum stokesii</h1>
<p>Polystichum stokesii, commonly known as Stokes' wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, giving the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
