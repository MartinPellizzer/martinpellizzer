<p>It features upright,丛生 stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a rough texture, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
