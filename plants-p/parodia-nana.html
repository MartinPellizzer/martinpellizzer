                    <h1>Parodia nana</h1>
<p>Parodia nana, commonly known as the dwarf moon cactus, is a compact cactus species native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem with a thick, fleshy body that stores water, typical of cacti. The plant produces small, white flowers during the warmer months, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Parodia nana is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and unique aesthetic.</p>
