<p>Polypodium clavifer, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to various parts of the world, including Asia, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, sword-shaped fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, clustered pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium clavifer is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
