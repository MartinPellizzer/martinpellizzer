<p>Prosthesia, commonly known as the "false fig," is a unique plant species characterized by its modified leaves that resemble fruits.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Africa. The plant's botanical features include a short, woody stem and clusters of small, leaf-like structures that serve as reproductive organs. These structures, called cyathia, contain both male and female flowers, making it a monoecious species.</p>
<p>Prosthesia is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive appearance.</p>
