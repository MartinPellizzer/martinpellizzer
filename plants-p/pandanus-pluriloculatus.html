                    <h1>Pandanus pluriloculatus</h1>
<p>Pandanus pluriloculatus, commonly known as the broad-leaf pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, palm-like leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which eventually develop into woody, three-lobed fruits. Its leaves are fibrous and can be woven into mats and thatch, making it economically valuable in some regions.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to coastal and wetland environments, thriving in humid, tropical climates.</p>
