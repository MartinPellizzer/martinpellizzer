                    <h1>Pteris raghavendrae</h1>
<p>Pteris raghavendrae, commonly known as the Raghavendra's water fern, is a species of fern native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
