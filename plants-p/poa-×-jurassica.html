                    <h1>Poa × jurassica</h1>
<p>Poa × jurassica, commonly known as the Jurassic grass, is a hybrid plant species that combines traits from different Poa species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typical of the Poa genus. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with wind-dispersed seeds, a feature common in many grasses. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique genetic makeup, it is of interest to botanists studying evolutionary adaptations in grass species.</p>
