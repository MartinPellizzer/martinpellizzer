                    <h1>Phylica aemula var. multibracteolata</h1>
<p>Phylica aemula var. multibracteolata, commonly known as the many-bractled silver bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves with a distinctive silver-white coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, hard, woody fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
