                    <h1>Penducella stalactites</h1>
<p>Penducella stalactites, commonly known as soda straws, are unique geological formations found in limestone caves.</p>
<p>These delicate, hollow tubes form through the slow deposition of calcium carbonate as mineral-rich water drips from the ceiling. They often appear as narrow, cylindrical structures that can grow several meters in length. Their growth is influenced by factors such as water flow, temperature, and the mineral content of the water.</p>
<p>While not a plant, they are sometimes mistaken for botanical structures due to their intricate, branching forms.</p>
