                    <h1>Psilothonna gamolepis</h1>
<p>Psilothonna gamolepis, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its pendulous, golden-yellow flowers that resemble small bells, hence its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Psilothonna gamolepis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
