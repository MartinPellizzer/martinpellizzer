                    <h1>Pteris feliciennae</h1>
<p>Pteris feliciennae, commonly known as the Felicienna's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are released from sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
