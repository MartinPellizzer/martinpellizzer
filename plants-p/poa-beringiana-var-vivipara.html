                    <h1>Poa beringiana var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Poa beringiana var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous bering grass, is a variant of the Bering grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and silver-blue foliage, which helps it withstand harsh, cold climates. This plant produces viviparous shoots—offspring that develop while still attached to the parent plant—allowing for rapid propagation in open, disturbed habitats. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of high-latitude ecosystems.</p>
