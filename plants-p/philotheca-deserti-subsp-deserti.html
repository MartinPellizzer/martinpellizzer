<p>Philotheca deserti subsp.</p>
<p>deserti, commonly known as the desert philotheca, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grey-green leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
