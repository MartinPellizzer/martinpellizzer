                    <h1>Peltaea steinbachii</h1>
<p>Peltaea steinbachii, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, ribbed stems and alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Peltaea steinbachii is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a characteristic species of alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
