                    <h1>Phoenix excelsior</h1>
<p>Phoenix excelsior, commonly known as the celestial flame palm, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, flame-like leaves that give it its name. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers, which appear in late summer, are pale yellow and emit a subtle fragrance.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Phoenix excelsior is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in its natural habitat.</p>
