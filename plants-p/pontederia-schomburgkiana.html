                    <h1>Pontederia schomburgkiana</h1>
<p>Pontederia schomburgkiana, commonly known as the purple rush or Schomburgk's water hyacinth, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a dense network of veins. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the water's surface. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
