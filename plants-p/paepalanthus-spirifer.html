<p>Paepalanthus spirifer, commonly known as the spiral-leaf cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, compact cactus with a short stem and dense, spiny foliage. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Paepalanthus spirifer is adapted to high-altitude conditions and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
