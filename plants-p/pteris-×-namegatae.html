                    <h1>Pteris × namegatae</h1>
<p>Pteris × namegatae, commonly known as the Japanese cliffbrake, is a hybrid fern that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Pteris cretica and Pteris multifida.</p>
<p>It features lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface, arranged in a compact, upright rosette. The plant is well adapted to moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle.</p>
<p>Pteris × namegatae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
