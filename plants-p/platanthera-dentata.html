                    <h1>Platanthera dentata</h1>
<p>Platanthera dentata, commonly known as the toothed lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to moist, shaded woodlands in North America.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces a dense, spiraled inflorescence of pale green to white flowers. The plant is characterized by its distinctive tooth-like projections on the petals, which give it its common name. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its ecological dependence on symbiotic relationships.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
