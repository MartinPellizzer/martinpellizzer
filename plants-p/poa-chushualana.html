                    <h1>Poa chushualana</h1>
<p>Poa chushualana, commonly known as the Chushualana grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Peru and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats on rocky or alpine slopes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with limited soil nutrients.</p>
<p>Poa chushualana plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
