<p>Poa clivicola, commonly known as the cliff grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its small, spikelet-based flowers are usually inconspicuous, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Poa clivicola plays a vital role in stabilizing soil on steep slopes and is an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
