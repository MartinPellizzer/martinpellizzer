<p>Pseudophegopteris pyrrhorhachis subsp.</p>
<p>laterepens, commonly known as the broad-veined water fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds with broad, parallel veins. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and the sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves. This subspecies is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, often growing in shallow water or along the edges of wetlands.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
