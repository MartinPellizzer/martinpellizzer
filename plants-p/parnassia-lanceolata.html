                    <h1>Parnassia lanceolata</h1>
<p>Parnassia lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf mountain buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features showy, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late summer, often in shaded woodland areas. The plant has a rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in rocky or acidic environments.</p>
<p>The species is also known for its symbiotic relationship with certain fungi, enhancing its ability to absorb nutrients.</p>
