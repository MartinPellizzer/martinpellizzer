<p>Pennisetum alopecuroides f. anacanthum, commonly known as purple fountain grass, is a compact, ornamental grass native to Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching stems that produce dense clusters of soft, purple plumes during the summer months. The foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds visual interest throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its vibrant color and drought tolerance, though it may require pruning to maintain its shape and prevent seed dispersal.</p>
