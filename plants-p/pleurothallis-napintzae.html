                    <h1>Pleurothallis napintzae</h1>
<p>Pleurothallis napintzae, commonly known as the Napintza orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
