                    <h1>Persea effusa var. parvifolia</h1>
<p>Persea effusa var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved avocado, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that are smaller than those of the typical Persea effusa. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, and its fruit is a smooth, green to yellowish avocado-like berry. The leaves are leathery and have a slight aromatic scent, while the bark is smooth and grayish in color.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also cultivated for its edible fruit in certain regions.</p>
