                    <h1>Platostoma coeruleum</h1>
<p>Platostoma coeruleum, commonly known as the blue waxy plant, is a succulent species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom during the cooler months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is often found growing in rocky soils or along rocky outcrops, where it can thrive with minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
