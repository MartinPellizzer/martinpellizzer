                    <h1>Phyllanthus jaegeri</h1>
<p>Phyllanthus jaegeri, commonly known as the Jaeger's spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the spurge family. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Phyllanthus jaegeri is also known for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses.</p>
