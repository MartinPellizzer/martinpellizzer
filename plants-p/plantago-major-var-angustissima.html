<p>Plantago major var. angustissima, commonly known as narrowleaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are typically borne on slender, upright stalks. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, roadsides, and other sunny, open areas.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical Plantago major.</p>
