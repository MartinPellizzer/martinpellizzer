                    <h1>Pseudotsuga salvadorii</h1>
<p>Pseudotsuga salvadorii, commonly known as the Salvador's hemlock, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Pseudotsuga, which includes other hemlock species, but it is distinct due to its unique geographic distribution. The tree typically grows in mountainous regions, preferring moist, well-drained soils and cooler climates. Its foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged spirally along the branches.</p>
<p>The cones are small and usually hang downward, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
