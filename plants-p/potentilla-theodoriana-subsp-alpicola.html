<p>Potentilla theodoriana subsp.</p>
<p>alpicola, commonly known as alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, wiry stems and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra.</p>
