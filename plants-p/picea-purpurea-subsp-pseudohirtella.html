<p>Picea purpurea subsp.</p>
<p>pseudohirtella, commonly known as the purple spruce, is a subspecies of the white spruce native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, conical shape and dark blue-green foliage that turns a striking purplish-red in the fall.</p>
<p>The needles are short, stiff, and often have a slightly waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cold, arid environment. It produces small, round cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to harsh mountain conditions, thriving in poor soils and high elevations.</p>
