                    <h1>Pachyphyllum serra</h1>
<p>Pachyphyllum serra, commonly known as the serrated stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Its rosette growth pattern and waxy leaf surface help reduce water loss through evaporation.</p>
<p>Pachyphyllum serra is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
