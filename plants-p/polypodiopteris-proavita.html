<p>Polypodiopteris proavita, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife.</p>
