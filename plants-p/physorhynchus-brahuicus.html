                    <h1>Physorhynchus brahuicus</h1>
<p>Physorhynchus brahuicus, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a unique aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that resemble a delicate lace, allowing it to thrive in slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, followed by the formation of buoyant, spore-bearing fruits. Its rhizomes are often found anchored to the substrate, enabling it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
