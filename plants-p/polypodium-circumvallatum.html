                    <h1>Polypodium circumvallatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium circumvallatum, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering.</p>
