                    <h1>Primula cushia</h1>
<p>Primula cushia, commonly known as the cushion primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, forming a cushion-like structure that helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad, hairy, and arranged in a rosette, which aids in moisture retention and protection from strong winds.</p>
<p>Primula cushia is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
