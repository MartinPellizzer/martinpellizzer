<p>Pinus fominii subsp.</p>
<p>cretacea, commonly known as the Cretaceous pine, is a rare and ancient subspecies of pine native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid than those of other pine species.</p>
<p>The cones of this subspecies are small and often persist on the tree for several years, contributing to its ecological role in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and protected plant in its native habitat.</p>
