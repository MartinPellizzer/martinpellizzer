                    <h1>Pleurothallis radula</h1>
<p>Pleurothallis radula, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has thin, wiry stems and narrow, strap-like leaves that help it cling to tree branches. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to survive.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
