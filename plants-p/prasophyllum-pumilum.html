<p>Prasophyllum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf leek orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny areas with well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and heathlands. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers in late winter to early spring. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
