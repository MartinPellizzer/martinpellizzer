<p>Paepalanthus arcuatus, commonly known as the curved-leaf cholla, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that branch out into clusters of small, spine-tipped pads. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, spiny structure. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>The species is often found in rocky soils and is a common sight in desert landscapes.</p>
