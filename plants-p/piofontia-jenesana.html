                    <h1>Piofontia jenesana</h1>
<p>Piofontia jenesana, commonly known as the Jenesan rock orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, spurred orchid flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are adapted to anchor in crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
