                    <h1>Physostegia serotina</h1>
<p>Physostegia serotina, commonly known as the late flowering bluebeard, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late summer to early fall. Its ornamental value is enhanced by the striking contrast between its dark purple flower buds and the bright blue petals.</p>
<p>Physostegia serotina is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
