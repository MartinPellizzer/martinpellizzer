<p>Poa pratensis var. alpigena, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a variant of the common bluegrass species.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in cooler, more elevated environments. This variety is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and tufted growth habit. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it forms dense, mat-like vegetation.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for erosion control and as a component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
