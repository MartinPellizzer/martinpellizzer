                    <h1>Polycarena cephalophora</h1>
<p>Polycarena cephalophora, commonly known as the helmet lichen, is a member of the family Pilocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen that typically grows on bark and soil in temperate forest environments. The thallus is characterized by its bright green to yellowish color, with a distinct, helmet-shaped apothecium. It forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides the photosynthetic capability necessary for the lichen's survival.</p>
<p>This species is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
