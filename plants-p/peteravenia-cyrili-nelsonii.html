                    <h1>Peteravenia cyrili-nelsonii</h1>
<p>Peteravenia cyrili-nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's pincushion, is a rare and striking member of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its dense, spiky inflorescence that resembles a pincushion, composed of tightly packed, woolly bracts. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it blooms during the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
