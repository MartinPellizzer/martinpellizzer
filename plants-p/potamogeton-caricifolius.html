                    <h1>Potamogeton caricifolius</h1>
<p>Potamogeton caricifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spikes, often emerging from the water's surface. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
