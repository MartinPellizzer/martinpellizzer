                    <h1>Psilotum triquetrum f. insulare</h1>
<p>Psilotum triquetrum f. insulare, commonly known as the insular psilotum, is a rare fern-like plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and small, scale-like leaves that lack true vascular tissue. This fern is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical or subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered at the base of the stems and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
