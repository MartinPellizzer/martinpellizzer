<p>Its leaves are arranged in an alternating pattern, giving it a visually striking appearance. The plant exhibits a complex vascular system typical of ferns, allowing for efficient water and nutrient transport. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest understories.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds, facilitating spore dispersal.</p>
