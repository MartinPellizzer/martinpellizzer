                    <h1>Prosthechea regnelliana</h1>
<p>Prosthechea regnelliana, commonly known as the yellow staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, tree-like rosette of broad, overlapping leaves that form a cradle for water and nutrients. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding a vibrant splash of color. Its leaves are tough and fibrous, providing structural support and aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Prosthechea regnelliana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
