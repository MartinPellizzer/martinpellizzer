                    <h1>Phoradendron inaequidentatum</h1>
<p>Phoradendron inaequidentatum, commonly known as the unequal-tooth mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the neotropical region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy, evergreen leaves and white, sticky berries. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the berries and excrete the seeds onto other host trees.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
