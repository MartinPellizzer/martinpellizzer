<p>Phymatopteris conmixta, commonly known as the mixed fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for the dispersal of spores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure that contributes to its ornamental appeal.</p>
