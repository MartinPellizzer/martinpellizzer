<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and pond margins. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, waterlogged environments.</p>
