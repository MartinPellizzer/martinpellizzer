                    <h1>Paronychia alpina</h1>
<p>Paronychia alpina, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its compact growth habit and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it a hardy species often found in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
<p>Paronychia alpina plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates.</p>
