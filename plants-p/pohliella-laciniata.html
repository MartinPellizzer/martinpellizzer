<p>Pohliella laciniata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental beauty.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
