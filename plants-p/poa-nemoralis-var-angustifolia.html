                    <h1>Poa nemoralis var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Poa nemoralis var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, often forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form cohesive vegetation mats.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Poa nemoralis.</p>
