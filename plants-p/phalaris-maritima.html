<p>Phalaris maritima, commonly known as sea panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in saline or brackish environments, such as salt marshes and coastal dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple. It is adapted to tolerate high salinity and fluctuating water levels, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize sandy soils along shorelines.</p>
