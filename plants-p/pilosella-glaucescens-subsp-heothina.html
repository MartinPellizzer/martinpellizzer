<p>Pilosella glaucescens subsp.</p>
<p>heothina, commonly known as the alpine blueweed, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, silver-green foliage.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
