                    <h1>Petastoma langlasseanum</h1>
<p>Petastoma langlasseanum, commonly known as the Langlasse's petasite, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with greenish-white flowers, which are typically pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
