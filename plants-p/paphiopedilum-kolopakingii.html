<p>Paphiopedilum kolopakingii, commonly known as the Kauai slipper orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination trap, a feature common among orchids in the Orchidaceae family. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid, with broad, leathery leaves and a compact growth habit. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
