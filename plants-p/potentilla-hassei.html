                    <h1>Potentilla hassei</h1>
<p>Potentilla hassei, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Potentilla hassei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions.</p>
