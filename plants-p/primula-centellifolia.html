<p>Primula centellifolia, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves that help it survive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with serrated edges, and it has a fibrous root system.</p>
<p>Primula centellifolia is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
