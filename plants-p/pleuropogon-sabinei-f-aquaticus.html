<p>Pleuropogon sabinei f. aquaticus, commonly known as the aquatic false panicgrass, is a grass species native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. Its growth habit is adapted to aquatic environments, with rhizomes that help anchor it in muddy substrates.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes.</p>
