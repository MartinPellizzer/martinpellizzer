                    <h1>Polystichum jiucaipingense</h1>
<p>Polystichum jiucaipingense, commonly known as the Jiucaiping fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in kidney-shaped groups. It thrives in shady, moist environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
