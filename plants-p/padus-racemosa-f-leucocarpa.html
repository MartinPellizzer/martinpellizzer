<p>Padus racemosa f. leucocarpa, commonly known as white-fruited elderberry, is a variant of the common elderberry.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America, particularly the eastern and central regions. The plant is characterized by its white, clustered flowers that appear in the spring, followed by small, white to yellowish fruits in the fall. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have serrated edges, while the bark is smooth and grayish.</p>
<p>This form is notable for its distinctive white fruits, which contrast with the typical black or dark purple berries of the standard species.</p>
