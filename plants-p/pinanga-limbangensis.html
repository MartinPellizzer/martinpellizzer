                    <h1>Pinanga limbangensis</h1>
<p>Pinanga limbangensis, commonly known as the Bornean bamboo palm, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, clustered stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, which are pollinated by insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, contributing to the structure of the forest understory.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
