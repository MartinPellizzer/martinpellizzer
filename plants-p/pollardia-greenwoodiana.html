                    <h1>Pollardia greenwoodiana</h1>
<p>Pollardia greenwoodiana, commonly known as the greenwood's pollardia, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
