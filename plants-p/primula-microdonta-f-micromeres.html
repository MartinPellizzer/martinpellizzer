                    <h1>Primula microdonta f. micromeres</h1>
<p>Primula microdonta f. micromeres, commonly known as the miniature primrose, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves that are densely packed at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, which helps to retain moisture in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is prized in horticulture for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in cool, shaded environments.</p>
