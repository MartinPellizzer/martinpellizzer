                    <h1>Phegopteris dianae</h1>
<p>Phegopteris dianae, commonly known as the Appalachian hart's-tongue fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, leathery fronds that resemble a hart's tongue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. It has a short rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
