                    <h1>Parodia mairanana</h1>
<p>Parodia mairanana, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a striking color contrast between its green stem and the brightly colored top, which is actually a grafted variety of another cactus species. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Parodia mairanana is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
