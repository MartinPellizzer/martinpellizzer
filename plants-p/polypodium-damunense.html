<p>Polypodium damunense, commonly known as the Damun fern, is a species of polypody fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sporangia.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually glossy and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
