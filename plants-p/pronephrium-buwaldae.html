                    <h1>Pronephrium buwaldae</h1>
<p>Pronephrium buwaldae, commonly known as the Bornean bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap aquatic prey. The plant is typically found in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies where it supplements its nutrient intake through predation. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing above the water surface.</p>
<p>Pronephrium buwaldae plays a role in its ecosystem by controlling small aquatic invertebrates and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
