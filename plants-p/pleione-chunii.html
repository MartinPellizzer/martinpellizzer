<p>Pleione chunii, commonly known as the Yunnan pleione, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically blooms in late winter or early spring, adding a touch of beauty to the forest understorey. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
