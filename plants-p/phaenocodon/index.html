                            <h1>Phaenocodon</h1>
<p>Phaenocodon, scientifically known as Phaenocodon, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Fabaceae. These plants are native to various regions across Asia, particularly in countries like China, Japan, and Korea. They are characterized by their delicate, pea-like flowers and compound leaves that often display a striking color contrast. Phaenocodon species are valued not only for their ornamental beauty but also for their ecological role in supporting local pollinators. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, several species within this genus are now considered vulnerable, making conservation efforts essential for their survival.</p>
