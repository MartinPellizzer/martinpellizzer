                    <h1>Peckoltia</h1>
<p>Peckoltia, commonly known as the dwarf pleco, is a small, freshwater catfish native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated body and distinctive, laterally compressed shape. The plant-like appearance of its body, with a series of bony plates, has led to its association with aquatic plants in its natural habitat. Peckoltia species typically thrive in slow-moving, densely vegetated waters.</p>
<p>They are popular in aquariums due to their peaceful nature and unique appearance.</p>
