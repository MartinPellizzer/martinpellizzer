<p>Pontia bauhini, commonly known as the alpine wallflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, come in shades of yellow and white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
