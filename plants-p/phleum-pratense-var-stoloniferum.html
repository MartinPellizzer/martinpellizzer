                    <h1>Phleum pratense var. stoloniferum</h1>
<p>Phleum pratense var. stoloniferum, commonly known as creeping timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of grassland ecosystems and a valuable forage plant.</p>
