The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
