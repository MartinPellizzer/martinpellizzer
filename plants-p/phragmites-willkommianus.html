<p>Phragmites willkommianus, commonly known as the narrowleaf common reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It forms dense stands and is often found in marshes, along lake shores, and in brackish tidal areas. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces feathery panicles of flowers in the summer. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive.</p>
