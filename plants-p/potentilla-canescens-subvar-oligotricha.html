                    <h1>Potentilla canescens subvar. oligotricha</h1>
<p>Potentilla canescens subvar. oligotricha, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, whitish hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and erosion control.</p>
