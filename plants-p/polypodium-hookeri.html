                    <h1>Polypodium hookeri</h1>
<p>Polypodium hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and robust, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The fronds are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat.</p>
