                    <h1>Phegopteris serrata</h1>
<p>Phegopteris serrata, commonly known as the serrated water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia, including India and China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the bottom of water bodies. Its leaves are pinnately divided with serrated edges, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Phegopteris serrata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
