<p>Pachyphyllum cyrtophyllum, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its dense, woolly foliage. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Pachyphyllum cyrtophyllum is also valued for its ability to thrive with minimal water and care.</p>
