                    <h1>Pyrus insculpta</h1>
<p>Pyrus insculpta, commonly known as the sculpted pear, is a rare species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply furrowed bark and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart pears that ripen in late summer. It is typically found in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus insculpta is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
