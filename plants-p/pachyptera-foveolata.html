                    <h1>Pachyptera foveolata</h1>
<p>Pachyptera foveolata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock cress, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, four-petaled white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It typically grows in crevices or on rocky outcrops, where it forms dense mats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
