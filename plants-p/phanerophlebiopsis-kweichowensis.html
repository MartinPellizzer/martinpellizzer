<p>Phanerophlebiopsis kweichowensis, commonly known as the Kweichow fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
