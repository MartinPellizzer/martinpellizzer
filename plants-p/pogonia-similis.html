                    <h1>Pogonia similis</h1>
<p>Pogonia similis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, leafless stems and showy, pinkish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. This epiphytic plant grows on the trunks of trees, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain rather than soil. Its flowers bloom in late summer and early fall, often in a single bloom per stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pogonia similis is considered endangered and is protected in many states.</p>
