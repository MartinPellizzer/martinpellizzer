<p>Potamogeton rufescens subsp.</p>
<p>helodes, commonly known as the redstem watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters such as lakes, ponds, and rivers.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often reddish at the base, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It is characterized by its ability to form dense stands, which can influence water clarity and habitat structure.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often managed carefully to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
