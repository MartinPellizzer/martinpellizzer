<p>Phegopteris levingei, commonly known as the Levinge's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters.</p>
<p>Phegopteris levingei plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
