                    <h1>Polystichum jizhushanense</h1>
<p>Polystichum jizhushanense, commonly known as the Jizhushan shield fern, is a species native to China, specifically the Jizhushan mountain range.</p>
<p>It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and deeply divided. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>This fern is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
