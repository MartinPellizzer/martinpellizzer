                    <h1>Poa urssulensis var. korshunensis</h1>
<p>Poa urssulensis var. korshunensis, commonly known as the Korshunov's meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are typically hairy and slightly compressed. The plant thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are generally narrow with a bluish-green hue, and it flowers in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to high-altitude environments.</p>
