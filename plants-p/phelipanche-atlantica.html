                    <h1>Phelipanche atlantica</h1>
<p>Phelipanche atlantica, commonly known as the Mediterranean broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various flowering plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a fibrous, root-like structure called a haustorium that penetrates the host's root system. It is native to southern Europe and North Africa, often found in dry, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings.</p>
