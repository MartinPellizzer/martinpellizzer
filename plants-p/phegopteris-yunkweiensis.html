                    <h1>Phegopteris yunkweiensis</h1>
<p>Phegopteris yunkweiensis, commonly known as the Yunkwei maidenhair fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a feature common to many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
