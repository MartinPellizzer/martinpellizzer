                    <h1>Potentilla bifurca var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Potentilla bifurca var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the variety 'glabrata' is distinguished by its smoother, hairless foliage. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes.</p>
