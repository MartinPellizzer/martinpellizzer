                    <h1>Polycnemum arvense var. filifolium</h1>
<p>Polycnemum arvense var. filifolium, commonly known as the filifolium variant of field sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides, fields, and stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often tufted at the base, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its finely divided, thread-like leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance compared to other Polycnemum species.</p>
