<p>Populus komarovii, commonly known as Komarov's poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forest-steppe and alpine environments.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth rate makes it an important species for reforestation and ecological restoration projects.</p>
