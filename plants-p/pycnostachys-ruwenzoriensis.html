                    <h1>Pycnostachys ruwenzoriensis</h1>
<p>Pycnostachys ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Ruwenzori Mountains in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and moths, which are adapted to its unique blooming cycle.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
