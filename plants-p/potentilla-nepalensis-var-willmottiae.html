                    <h1>Potentilla nepalensis var. willmottiae</h1>
<p>Potentilla nepalensis var. willmottiae, commonly known as the Nepal cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters, with multiple stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and serrated, with a slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
