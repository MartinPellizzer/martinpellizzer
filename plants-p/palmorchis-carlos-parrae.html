                    <h1>Palmorchis carlos-parrae</h1>
<p>Palmorchis carlos-parrae, commonly known as the Carlos-Parra's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that resemble those of the orchid genus Dendrophylax. The plant is epiphytic, growing on trees without deriving nutrients from them, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
