                    <h1>Paspalum saugetii</h1>
<p>Paspalum saugetii, commonly known as desert grass or Mexican grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it a common component of desert vegetation.</p>
<p>Paspalum saugetii is also used in some regions for forage and erosion control due to its hardy nature.</p>
