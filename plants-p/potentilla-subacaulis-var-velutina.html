                    <h1>Potentilla subacaulis var. velutina</h1>
<p>Potentilla subacaulis var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a soft, woolly texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy plant in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
