                    <h1>Phleum alpinum var. nigricans</h1>
<p>Phleum alpinum var. nigricans, commonly known as alpine barley, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, coarse leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It produces small, two-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop in alpine regions.</p>
