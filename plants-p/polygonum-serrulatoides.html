<p>Polygonum serrulatoides, commonly known as the serrulate knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Polygonum serrulatoides is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks.</p>
