                    <h1>Pseudophegopteris pyrrhorhachis var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Pseudophegopteris pyrrhorhachis var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed water fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically smooth and glabrous, lacking the hairy texture found in other varieties. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in swampy areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, which help stabilize the soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal.</p>
