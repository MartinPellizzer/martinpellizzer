<p>Polyspora borneensis, commonly known as the Borneo polypore, is a rare fungal species native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polyporaceae and is characterized by its tough, woody fruiting bodies that typically grow on dead wood. The fungus exhibits a distinctive white to pale yellow cap with a spongy texture, and its spores are released in a powdery form. It plays an important ecological role in decomposing organic matter in tropical forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest to mycologists and conservationists.</p>
