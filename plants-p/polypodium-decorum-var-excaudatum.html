                    <h1>Polypodium decorum var. excaudatum</h1>
<p>Polypodium decorum var. excaudatum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a rare and striking fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that are often covered in a fine, soft pubescence, giving it a unique tactile quality. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along streams. Its rhizomes are short and robust, allowing it to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
