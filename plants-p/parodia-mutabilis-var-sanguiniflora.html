<p>Parodia mutabilis var. sanguiniflora, commonly known as the Blood Flora or Crimson Ghost Cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height, covered in white, woolly hairs that provide insulation against extreme temperatures. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of pink to deep red, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system to access water in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly sought after by collectors and requires specific care to thrive.</p>
