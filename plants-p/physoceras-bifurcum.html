<p>Physoceras bifurcum, commonly known as the forked bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may be partially emergent.</p>
<p>Physoceras bifurcum is known for its unique adaptation to nutrient-poor waters by capturing prey to supplement its nutritional needs.</p>
