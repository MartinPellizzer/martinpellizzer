<p>Prunus macrophylla var. adenopoda, commonly known as the glossy buckthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
