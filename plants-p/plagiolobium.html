                    <h1>Plagiolobium</h1>
<p>Plagiolobium, commonly known as the "butterfly plant," is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive butterfly-shaped leaves, which are often lobed and have a striking appearance. Plagiolobium species typically produce small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>These plants are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
