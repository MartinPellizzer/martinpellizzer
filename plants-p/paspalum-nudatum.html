<p>Paspalum nudatum, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are clustered along the stem, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Paspalum nudatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
