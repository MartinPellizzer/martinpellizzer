<p>Pedicularis crassicaulis, commonly known as the thick-stemmed lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often resembling those of orchids. It thrives in high-altitude environments with poor soil conditions, often growing in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
