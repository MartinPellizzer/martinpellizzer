                    <h1>Pinus pseudostrobus var. coatepecensis</h1>
<p>Pinus pseudostrobus var. coatepecensis, commonly known as the Coatepec pine, is a rare variant of the Mexican pine native to the Sierra Madre de Oaxaca in southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically longer than those of the standard species. The cones of this variety are relatively small and often have a distinctive reddish-brown color when mature. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
