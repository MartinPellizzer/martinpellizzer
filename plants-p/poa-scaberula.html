                    <h1>Poa scaberula</h1>
<p>Poa scaberula, commonly known as rough bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
