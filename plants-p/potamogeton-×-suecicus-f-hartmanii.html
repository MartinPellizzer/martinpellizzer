<p>It is characterized by its submerged aquatic growth habit, with long, narrow leaves that are often ribbon-like in appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets, which are submerged or floating at the water surface. It is native to freshwater environments in Europe and is often found in slow-moving or still waters such as lakes and ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
