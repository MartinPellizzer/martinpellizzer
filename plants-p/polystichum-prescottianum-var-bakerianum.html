<p>Polystichum prescottianum var. bakerianum, commonly known as the Baker's barren sword fern, is a variant of the barren sword fern native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its lanceolate, leathery, and often serrated fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
