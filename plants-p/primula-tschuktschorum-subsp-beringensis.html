<p>Primula tschuktschorum subsp.</p>
<p>beringensis, commonly known as the Bering Primrose, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy, often succulent leaves that help it survive in cold, harsh environments.</p>

<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme climates.</p>
