<p>Pteris sloanei, commonly known as the Sloane's water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of spore-bearing sorus on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Pteris sloanei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
