<p>Polygala carnosicaulis, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters, often in shades of pink or white. Its leaves are usually narrow and opposite, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Polygala carnosicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
