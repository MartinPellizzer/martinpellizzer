<p>Pereskia glomerata, commonly known as the cactus apple, is a unique succulent native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered in short, stiff hairs, resembling a shrub more than a typical cactus. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often blooming in the evening. Its fruit, which is edible, is a berry-like structure that contains numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Despite its cactus-like appearance, Pereskia glomerata is botanically classified as a member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
