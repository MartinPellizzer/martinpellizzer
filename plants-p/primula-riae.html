<p>Primula riae, commonly known as the Alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, helping to retain moisture in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Primula riae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
