                    <h1>Pitcairnia loki-schmidtiae</h1>
<p>Pitcairnia loki-schmidtiae, commonly known as the Loki Schmidt's pitcairnia, is a rare bromeliad native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, colorful rosette of fleshy, strap-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom sequentially. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
