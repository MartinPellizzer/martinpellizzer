                    <h1>Poa rigens var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Poa rigens var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous meadowgrass, is a variant of the meadowgrass species characterized by its unique reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>This plant produces viviparous shoots, which are capable of rooting and growing into new plants while still attached to the parent plant. It typically thrives in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows and along stream banks. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and the plant forms dense, low-growing clumps.</p>
<p>Its ability to propagate vegetatively makes it a resilient and widespread species in its native habitat.</p>
