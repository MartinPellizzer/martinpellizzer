<p>Procris pedunculata var. eupedunculata, commonly known as the showy false Solomon's seal, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early to mid-summer. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that ripens in late summer, providing food for birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its longer pedicels compared to the typical form of Procris pedunculata.</p>
