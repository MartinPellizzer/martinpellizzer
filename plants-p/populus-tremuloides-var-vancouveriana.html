                    <h1>Populus tremuloides var. vancouveriana</h1>
<p>Populus tremuloides var. vancouveriana, commonly known as the Vancouver trembling aspen, is a variant of the trembling aspen native to western North America.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and heart-shaped leaves that tremble in the wind. The bark is smooth and grayish-white, becoming fissured with age, while the leaves are typically smaller and more finely toothed than those of the standard trembling aspen. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along mountain slopes.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing streambanks and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
