                    <h1>Platytaenia depauperata</h1>
<p>Platytaenia depauperata, commonly known as the sparse-leaved sunflower, is a herbaceous plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it access groundwater. Its small stature and drought tolerance make it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>However, it is relatively rare and faces threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
