                    <h1>Polygala rupestris subvar. canescens</h1>
<p>Polygala rupestris subvar. canescens, commonly known as the gray-haired polygala, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky habitats in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine, grayish pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This subspecies thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in open grasslands.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
