                    <h1>Panicum mauritianum</h1>
<p>Panicum mauritianum, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa, Australia, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous narrow, awn-tipped florets. It is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought and heat.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range.</p>
