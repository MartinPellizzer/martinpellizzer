<p>Paspalum tenax, commonly known as wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Paspalum tenax is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
