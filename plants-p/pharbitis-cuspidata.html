                    <h1>Pharbitis cuspidata</h1>
<p>Pharbitis cuspidata, commonly known as morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heliotropic leaves that follow the sun's movement throughout the day. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in a variety of colors, including blue, purple, and pink. Its vine-like growth habit allows it to climb and spread across supports, making it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>The seeds are encased in a hard, spiral-shaped pod that splits open when mature, releasing the seeds in a spiral motion.</p>
