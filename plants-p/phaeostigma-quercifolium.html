                    <h1>Phaeostigma quercifolium</h1>
<p>Phaeostigma quercifolium, commonly known as the oak-leaved phaeostigma, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which resemble those of an oak tree, with lobed margins and a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Phaeostigma quercifolium thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats.</p>
