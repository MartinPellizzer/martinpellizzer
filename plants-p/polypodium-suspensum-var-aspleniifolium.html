                    <h1>Polypodium suspensum var. aspleniifolium</h1>
<p>Polypodium suspensum var. aspleniifolium, commonly known as the hanging polypody, is a fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that often trail from branches or rocks. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside.</p>
