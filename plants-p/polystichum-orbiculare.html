                    <h1>Polystichum orbiculare</h1>
<p>Polystichum orbiculare, commonly known as the round-leaf wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its distinctive, orbicular (rounded) fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Polystichum orbiculare is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to add texture and interest to shaded garden spaces.</p>
