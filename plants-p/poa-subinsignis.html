<p>Poa subinsignis, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet meadows, stream banks, and other riparian habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Poa subinsignis is an important component of native plant communities in its range.</p>
