<p>Papaver somniferum subsp.</p>
<p>officinale, commonly known as the opium poppy, is a flowering plant native to the region spanning the eastern Mediterranean to central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, rose-like flowers and capsule-shaped seed pods that contain latex-rich cells.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features include smooth, dark green leaves with a slightly lobed appearance and a sturdy, upright stem. The latex extracted from its immature seed pods is the source of opium and its derivatives, such as morphine and codeine.</p>
