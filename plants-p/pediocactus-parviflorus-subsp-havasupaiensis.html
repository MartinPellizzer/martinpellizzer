<p>Pediocactus parviflorus subsp.</p>
<p>havasupaiensis, commonly known as the Havasupai prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its short, spiny stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>The plant has a compact growth form, typically reaching only a few inches in height. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, adapting to arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is particularly found in the Havasupai Indian Reservation in Arizona, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
