                    <h1>Polybotrya fractiserialis</h1>
<p>Polybotrya fractiserialis, commonly known as the clustered spike moss, is a rare and delicate fern-like plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Huperjiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, branching structure that resembles a cluster of tiny spikes. The plant has slender, wiry stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that give it a unique, almost architectural appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
