<p>Pavia coriacea, commonly known as the rough pavia, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by oval, fleshy fruits. Its bark is thick and corky, which gives it its scientific name "coriacea," meaning "leathery" in Latin.</p>
<p>Pavia coriacea is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal uses.</p>
