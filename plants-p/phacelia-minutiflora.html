<p>Phacelia minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Phacelia minutiflora is also valued for its use in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
