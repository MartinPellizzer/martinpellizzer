<p>Pentaschistis trisetoides var. expansa, commonly known as the broad-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It grows close to the ground, often forming dense mats, and is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscapes.</p>
