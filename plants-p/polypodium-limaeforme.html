                    <h1>Polypodium limaeforme</h1>
<p>Polypodium limaeforme, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky surfaces, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Polypodium limaeforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light.</p>
