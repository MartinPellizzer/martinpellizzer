<p>Paronychia pontica, commonly known as the Pontic sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the steppes of Eastern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters and has a mat-like growth habit, forming dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant features basal leaves that are linear to oblanceolate in shape, often with a hairy surface. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing numerous small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees.</p>
<p>Paronychia pontica is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats with full sun exposure.</p>
