                    <h1>Phyllactinia</h1>
<p>Phyllactinia, commonly known as the cup fungi, is a genus of ascomycete fungi that produce distinctive cup-shaped fruiting bodies.</p>
<p>These fungi are typically found on decaying wood, where they play a role in decomposing organic matter. The structure of Phyllactinia includes a cup-like receptacle with a central stem, often covered in a layer of spore-producing structures called pycnidia. They are commonly associated with coniferous trees and are often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The genus is important in ecological systems for nutrient cycling and soil health.</p>
