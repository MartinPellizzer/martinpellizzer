                    <h1>Pentaphragma</h1>
<p>Pentaphragma, commonly known as the five-ribbed liverwort, is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, thalloid structure and the presence of distinct, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. The plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or soil surfaces. They are often found in temperate regions and exhibit a variety of morphological adaptations for survival in these habitats.</p>
<p>Pentaphragma species are important in ecological studies due to their role in soil stabilization and as indicators of environmental conditions.</p>
