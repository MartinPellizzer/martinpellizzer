<p>Phalaris aquatica var. major, commonly known as the common marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes, riverbanks, and floodplains, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, greenish-white flowers that appear in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This versatile plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems.</p>
