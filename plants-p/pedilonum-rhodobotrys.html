<p>Pedilonum rhodobotrys, commonly known as the red-leaf orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid red foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has elongated, fleshy roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically borne on slender stems and feature intricate patterns of purple and white.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Pedilonum rhodobotrys is considered endangered and is protected in several countries.</p>
