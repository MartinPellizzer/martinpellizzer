<p>Pyrus sinai, commonly known as the Sinai pear, is a rare and ancient species native to the Sinai Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a small deciduous tree that typically grows in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are not commonly consumed by humans but are used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with a subtle fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus sinai is considered a botanically significant and endangered species.</p>
