                    <h1>Poa pumila</h1>
<p>Poa pumila, commonly known as the alpine moss grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to cold and alpine environments.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, cushion-like mats close to the ground, which help it survive in harsh, wind-swept conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention and protection from extreme temperatures. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Poa pumila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna.</p>
