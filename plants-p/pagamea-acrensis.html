<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pagamea acrensis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
