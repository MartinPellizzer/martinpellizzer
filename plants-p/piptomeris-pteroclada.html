<p>Piptomeris pteroclada, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock.</p>
