<p>Placea germainii subsp.</p>
<p>lutea, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its yellow flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>
