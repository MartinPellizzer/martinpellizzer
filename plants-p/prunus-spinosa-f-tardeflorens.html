<p>Prunus spinosa f. tardeflorens, commonly known as the late-flowering blackthorn, is a compact shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, oval leaves that are typically glossy green. The plant produces clusters of white or pale green flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, dark purple berries. Its foliage and flowers provide valuable nectar sources for pollinators, and it is often used in hedgerows for its ornamental and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>The variety is distinguished by its delayed flowering compared to the typical blackthorn.</p>
