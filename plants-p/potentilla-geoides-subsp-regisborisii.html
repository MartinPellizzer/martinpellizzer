<p>Potentilla geoides subsp.</p>
<p>regisborisii, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
