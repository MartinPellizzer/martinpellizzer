                    <h1>Persica vulgaris var. pendula</h1>
<p>Persica vulgaris var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping cherry or weeping peach, is a cultivar of the peach tree characterized by its cascading, drooping branches.</p>
<p>It produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, fuzzy fruits. The plant is native to Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its fruit. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
<p>The weeping habit of the branches makes it a popular choice for gardens and public landscapes.</p>
