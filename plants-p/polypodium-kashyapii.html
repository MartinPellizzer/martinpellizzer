<p>Polypodium kashyapii, commonly known as the Kashyap's water fern, is a species of polypody found in the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its fronds that are typically leathery and divided into narrow segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in the understory of dense forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Polypodium kashyapii plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
