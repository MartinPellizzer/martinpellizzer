                    <h1>Pedicularis pennellii</h1>
<p>Pedicularis pennellii, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on host plants for nutrients. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and ecological niche make it a subject of interest in both botanical and ecological studies.</p>
