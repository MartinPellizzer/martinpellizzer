                    <h1>Pollalesta discolor</h1>
<p>Pollalesta discolor, commonly known as the variable ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that bloom on slender, wiry stems. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air and rain for sustenance. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species.</p>
