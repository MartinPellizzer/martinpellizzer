<p>Polypodium subvestitum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with dense, overlapping fronds that give it a velvety appearance. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its habitat.</p>
