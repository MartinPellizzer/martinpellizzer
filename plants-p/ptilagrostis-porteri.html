                    <h1>Ptilagrostis porteri</h1>
<p>Ptilagrostis porteri, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in loose, sandy soils and access deep moisture sources.</p>
<p>Ptilagrostis porteri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
