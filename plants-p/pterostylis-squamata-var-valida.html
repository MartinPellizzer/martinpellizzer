The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>The species is relatively rare and is of conservation interest due to habitat loss and fragmentation.</p>
