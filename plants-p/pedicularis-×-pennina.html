                    <h1>Pedicularis × pennina</h1>
<p>Pedicularis × pennina, commonly known as the hybrid monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often resembling small orchids. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on the roots of other plants.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticulture.</p>
