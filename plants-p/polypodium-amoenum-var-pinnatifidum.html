<p>Polypodium amoenum var. pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce multiple shoots, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year.</p>
