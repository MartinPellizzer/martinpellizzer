                    <h1>Polygonum howellii</h1>
<p>Polygonum howellii, commonly known as Howell's knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, reddish stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as streambanks and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a common weed and a potential ecological indicator species.</p>
