                    <h1>Pinguicula lusitanica</h1>
<p>Pinguicula lusitanica, commonly known as the Iberian butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of succulent, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small insects. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring or summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or calcareous soils.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as both a predator and a plant.</p>
