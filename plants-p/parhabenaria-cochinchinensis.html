<p>Parhabenaria cochinchinensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese spider orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial herb with a single, slender stem and a few leaves. The plant produces delicate, spider-like flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with purple markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, its population has declined significantly in recent decades.</p>
