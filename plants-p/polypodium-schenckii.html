<p>Polypodium schenckii, commonly known as the Schenck's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and fronds that are typically leathery and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common reproductive feature in ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
