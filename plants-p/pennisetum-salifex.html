                    <h1>Pennisetum salifex</h1>
<p>Pennisetum salifex, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salty and drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Pennisetum salifex has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in saline soils makes it an important plant for ecological restoration and land rehabilitation projects.</p>
