<p>Pedicularis laxiflora, commonly known as the lax flowered lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic nature, relying on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often resembling the shape of a louse, hence its common name.
