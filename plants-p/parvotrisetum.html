<p>Parvotrisetum, commonly known as the small spikegrass, is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. Parvotrisetum species are often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands.</p>
<p>These grasses are generally short-lived perennials and play a role in stabilizing soil in their native environments.</p>
