                    <h1>Parkinsonia anacantha</h1>
<p>Parkinsonia anacantha, commonly known as the screwbean tree, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often mistaken for the leaves of the mimosa plant due to their sensitive, folding response to touch. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it is well adapted to drought conditions. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil and low-water environments.</p>
<p>Parkinsonia anacantha is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded landscapes.</p>
