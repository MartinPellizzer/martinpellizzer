                    <h1>Polypodium cheilanthoides</h1>
<p>Polypodium cheilanthoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is commonly found in dry, sunny habitats such as crevices and slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Polypodium cheilanthoides is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
