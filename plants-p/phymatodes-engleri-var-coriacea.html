<p>Phymatodes engleri var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough phymatode, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, leathery foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a rough, textured surface, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
