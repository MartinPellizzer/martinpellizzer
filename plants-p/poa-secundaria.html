                    <h1>Poa secundaria</h1>
<p>Poa secundaria, commonly known as the secondary bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to various parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along streambanks. Poa secundaria produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a forage plant for grazing animals and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
