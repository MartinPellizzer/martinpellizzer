The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, with a distinctive purplish hue at the base.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
