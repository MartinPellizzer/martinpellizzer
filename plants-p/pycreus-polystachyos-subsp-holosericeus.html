<p>Pycreus polystachyos subsp.</p>
<p>holosericeus, commonly known as the silver-leaved ironwood, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with silvery-gray undersides, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. Its leaves are leathery and have a rough texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained soils.</p>
