<p>Pedicularis sudetica subsp.</p>
<p>scopulorum, commonly known as the Alpine monkey orchid, is a rare and specialized member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe, particularly in the Sudetes and Carpathian ranges.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers with a distinctive yellow throat, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, alpine habitats and is often found in open meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
