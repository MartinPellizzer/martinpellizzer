<p>Platanthera bifolia proles robusta, commonly known as the robust common twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a spike, lacking petals but featuring prominent sepals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows, often growing in association with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects adaptations to low-light conditions and nutrient-poor soils.</p>
