                    <h1>Poa hosteana</h1>
<p>Poa hosteana, commonly known as the Hoste's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest margins. The plant has a dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it thrive in compacted soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Poa hosteana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem.</p>
