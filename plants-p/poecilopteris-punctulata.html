                    <h1>Poecilopteris punctulata</h1>
<p>Poecilopteris punctulata, commonly known as the dotted water fern, is a prehistoric fern species that thrived during the Carboniferous and Permian periods.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate fronds with a distinctive pattern of small, rounded sori that are often arranged in a dotted or scattered manner. This plant was part of the dense, swampy forests that dominated the Earth's landscape during the Paleozoic era. Its leaves were typically large and pinnately divided, contributing to the lush vegetation that supported early ecosystems.</p>
<p>Fossil records of Poecilopteris punctulata provide valuable insights into the evolution of ferns and ancient plant life.</p>
