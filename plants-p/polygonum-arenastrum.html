<p>Polygonum arenastrum, commonly known as sand polygon, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often covering rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Polygonum arenastrum is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
