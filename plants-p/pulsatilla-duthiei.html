<p>Pulsatilla duthiei, commonly known as the Duthie's pasqueflower, is a rare and delicate member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range from white to pale yellow, often with a distinctive purple or brown center. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. It has palmate leaves with three to five lobes, and its stems are usually hairy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pulsatilla duthiei is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
