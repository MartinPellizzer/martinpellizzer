                    <h1>Phyllodes</h1>
<p>Phyllodes, commonly known as the "needle grass" or "garden spurge," are specialized leaf structures found in certain species of acacia plants.</p>
<p>They are flattened, leaf-like appendages that serve as modified stems, often functioning as photosynthetic organs. Phyllodes are typically narrow and elongated, with a reduced vascular system compared to typical leaves. They are adapted to arid environments, helping the plant conserve water through reduced surface area.</p>
<p>These structures are often mistaken for true leaves but play a crucial role in the plant's survival and growth.</p>
