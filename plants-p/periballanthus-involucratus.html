<p>Periballanthus involucratus, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Periballanthus involucratus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
