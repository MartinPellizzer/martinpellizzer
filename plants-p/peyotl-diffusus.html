                    <h1>Peyotl diffusus</h1>
<p>Peyotl diffusus, commonly known as the Mexican peyote, is a small, spineless cactus native to the deserts of northern Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It contains the psychoactive compound mescaline, which is responsible for its hallucinogenic effects. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters and has a dense, rounded stem covered in areoles. Peyote is often cultivated in controlled environments due to its legal status and conservation concerns.</p>
<p>Its use has deep cultural significance among indigenous communities, particularly in religious ceremonies.</p>
