                    <h1>Potamogeton densus var. angustifolius</h1>
<p>Potamogeton densus var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which emerge from the water surface during the summer months. Its rhizomes form dense underwater mats, contributing to water clarity by stabilizing sediments.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
