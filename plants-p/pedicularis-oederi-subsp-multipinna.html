<p>Pedicularis oederi subsp.</p>
<p>multipinna, commonly known as the clustered monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive lip-shaped petal. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often found in alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
