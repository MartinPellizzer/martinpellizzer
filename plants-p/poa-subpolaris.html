                    <h1>Poa subpolaris</h1>
<p>Poa subpolaris, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the cold regions of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh environments such as Antarctica, southern South America, and New Zealand, where it forms dense mats on rocky or barren ground. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny flowers. It is adapted to survive in extreme cold and low nutrient conditions, with a deep root system to access moisture.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of polar and alpine ecosystems.</p>
