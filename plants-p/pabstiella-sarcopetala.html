<p>Pabstiella sarcopetala, commonly known as the stone petal orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring small, fleshy leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. Its reproductive strategy involves a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its survival.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pabstiella sarcopetala is considered an endangered species.</p>
