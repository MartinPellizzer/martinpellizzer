<p>Prunus × subhirtella var. pleniflora, commonly known as the double-flowered cherry, is a hybrid deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is prized for its abundant, showy double blooms that appear in early spring, often in shades of white, pink, or red. The flowers consist of multiple layers of petal-like structures, giving them a full, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, tart cherries that are edible but not typically cultivated for consumption.</p>
<p>It is widely grown in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established.</p>
