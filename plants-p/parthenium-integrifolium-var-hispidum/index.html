                            <h1>Parthenium Integrifolium Var. Hispidum</h1>
<p>Mexican fleabane, scientifically known as Parthenium integrifolium var. hispidum, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open habitats where it thrives in full sun. The plant is characterized by its daisy-like flowers and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Despite its common name, it is not a true fleabane and does not repel fleas, though it has been used traditionally in some herbal remedies. Its resilience and adaptability make it an important species in ecological studies and weed management.</p>
