                    <h1>Polydictyum juglandifolium</h1>
<p>Polydictyum juglandifolium, commonly known as the American holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that resemble holly leaves, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they are produced in the second year of the plant's life cycle.</p>
<p>The spores are released from sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, facilitating its reproduction in suitable habitats.</p>
