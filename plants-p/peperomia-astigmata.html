                    <h1>Peperomia astigmata</h1>
<p>Peperomia astigmata, commonly known as the silver peperomia, is a compact, low-maintenance plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features glossy, dark green leaves with a silvery-white underside, giving it a striking, almost metallic appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or red, which are not the main ornamental feature. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Peperomia astigmata is ideal for indoor cultivation due to its ability to tolerate low light and minimal watering.</p>
