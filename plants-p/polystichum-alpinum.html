                    <h1>Polystichum alpinum</h1>
<p>Polystichum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in rocky soils at high altitudes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Polystichum alpinum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, woodland settings.</p>
