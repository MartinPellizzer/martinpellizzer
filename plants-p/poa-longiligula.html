                    <h1>Poa longiligula</h1>
<p>Poa longiligula, commonly known as the long-leaved bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically longer and more delicate than those of other Poa species. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage, making it less conspicuous. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Poa longiligula is considered a rare and specialized plant.</p>
