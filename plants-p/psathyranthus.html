                    <h1>Psathyranthus</h1>
<p>Psathyranthus, commonly known as the "scented orchid," is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and are known for their fragrant, showy flowers. Psathyranthus species typically have slender stems and produce clusters of small, brightly colored blooms that range from white to pink and purple. The flowers are often described as having a delicate, sweet aroma, which contributes to their popularity in horticulture.</p>
<p>Due to their specific habitat requirements, they are relatively rare and often cultivated in greenhouses or specialized gardens.</p>
