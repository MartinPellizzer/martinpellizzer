                    <h1>Paspalum gnaphalioideum</h1>
<p>Paspalum gnaphalioideum, commonly known as the silvergrass or coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and dense, mat-like growth habit, which helps it thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in summer, which are arranged in narrow, spike-like inflorescences. It is highly drought-tolerant and salt-resistant, making it well-suited for coastal landscapes and erosion control.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and ecological benefits have made it a popular choice in native plant gardens and restoration projects.</p>
