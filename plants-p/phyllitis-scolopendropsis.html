                    <h1>Phyllitis scolopendropsis</h1>
<p>Phyllitis scolopendropsis, commonly known as the golden hairgrass, is a small perennial grass native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, golden hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
