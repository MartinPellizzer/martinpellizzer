<p>Peltochlaena nephrodioides, commonly known as the kidney-leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, kidney-shaped fronds that are often deeply lobed and have a glossy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or moist soil substrates.</p>
<p>The foliage is not only ornamental but also plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
