                    <h1>Platanthera bifolia lusus reichenbachiana</h1>
<p>Platanthera bifolia lusus reichenbachiana, commonly known as the Reichenbach's fairy orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks rather than in soil. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity and moderate temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
