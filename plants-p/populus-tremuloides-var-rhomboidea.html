                    <h1>Populus tremuloides var. rhomboidea</h1>
<p>Populus tremuloides var. rhomboidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aspen, is a variant of the trembling aspen found primarily in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are narrower and more elongated compared to the typical aspen leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, which are important for pollination. Its bark is generally smoother and lighter in color than that of the common aspen.</p>
<p>This variant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas across the northern United States and Canada.</p>
