<p>Pedicularis altifrontalis, commonly known as the alpine lousewort, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clusters of small, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
