                    <h1>Phaca prostrata</h1>
<p>Phaca prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate phaca, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming habit with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Phaca prostrata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
