                            <h1>Pandanus Oblongus</h1>
<p>Pandanus oblongus is a striking tropical plant known for its unique, sword-like leaves that sway gracefully in coastal breezes. Native to the Pacific islands, it thrives in sandy soils and salty air, making it a common sight along shores and mangrove forests. This plant plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various species. Its distinctive appearance has made it a popular ornamental plant in gardens worldwide. Despite its beauty, Pandanus oblongus remains a symbol of resilience in harsh, dynamic environments.</p>
