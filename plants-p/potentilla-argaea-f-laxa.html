                    <h1>Potentilla argaea f. laxa</h1>
<p>Potentilla argaea f. laxa, commonly known as the laxa form of the silverweed, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and oval, with a slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This form is notable for its compact growth habit and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
