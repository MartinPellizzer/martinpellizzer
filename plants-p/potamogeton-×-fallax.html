                    <h1>Potamogeton × fallax</h1>
<p>Potamogeton × fallax, commonly known as the hybrid water milfoil, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Potamogeton perfoliatus and Potamogeton obtusifolius, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often submerged or floating.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it can impact water flow and aquatic ecosystems.</p>
