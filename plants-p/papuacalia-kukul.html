                    <h1>Papuacalia kukul</h1>
<p>Papuacalia kukul, commonly known as the Kukul's ghost flower, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Papuacalia kukul is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
