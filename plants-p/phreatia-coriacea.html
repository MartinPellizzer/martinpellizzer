<p>Phreatia coriacea, commonly known as the hardy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, fibrous roots and thick, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with white petals and a yellow lip, often blooming in the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical gardens.</p>
