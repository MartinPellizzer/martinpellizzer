                    <h1>Pedicularis ochroleuca</h1>
<p>Pedicularis ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellow monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for nutrients while still performing some photosynthesis. It typically blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in moist, open meadows and rocky areas at higher elevations.</p>
