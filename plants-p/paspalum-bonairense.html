<p>Paspalum bonairense, commonly known as the Bahamian grass, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salty air.</p>
<p>Paspalum bonairense is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
