                    <h1>Pappophorum avenaceum var. nanum</h1>
<p>Pappophorum avenaceum var. nanum, commonly known as dwarf oatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in silky, hair-like structures called pappus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along streambanks, and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its fine texture and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
