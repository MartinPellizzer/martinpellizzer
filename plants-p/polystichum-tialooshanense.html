<p>Polystichum tialooshanense, commonly known as the Tialooshan holly fern, is a species of fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in shaded, moist forest environments, where it thrives in the understory vegetation.</p>
