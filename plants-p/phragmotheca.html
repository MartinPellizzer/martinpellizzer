<p>Phragmotheca, commonly known as the "flowering sea anemone," is a marine organism belonging to the order Sphenoporida.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, cup-shaped body with a central mouth surrounded by long, flexible tentacles. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its tentacles for capturing prey and absorbing nutrients. Phragmotheca thrives in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures are located within the central cavity, and it reproduces both sexually and asexually through budding.</p>
