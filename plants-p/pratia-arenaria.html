                    <h1>Pratia arenaria</h1>
<p>Pratia arenaria, commonly known as beach sandplant, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal areas of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, saline environments and is well-adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions such as strong winds and salt spray. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. Its flowers are typically pale blue or purple and are clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Pratia arenaria plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion along coastal regions.</p>
