                    <h1>Pistacia nemausensis</h1>
<p>Pistacia nemausensis, commonly known as the Nemausus pistachio, is a species of flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar to true pistachios but are not widely cultivated for commercial use. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure member of the Pistacia genus.</p>
