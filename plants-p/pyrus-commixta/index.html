                            <h1>Pyrus Commixta</h1>
<p>Pyrus commixta is a lesser-known species of apple tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, sour fruits and its ability to thrive in diverse environmental conditions. Despite its modest size, it holds cultural and ecological significance in its native regions. The plant is often overlooked in favor of more commercially valuable apple varieties. Its unique traits make it an interesting subject for botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
