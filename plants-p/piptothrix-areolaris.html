<p>Piptothrix areolaris, commonly known as the areolar pincushion cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny clusters of stems that form a spherical or cushion-like shape. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, adapting to arid environments.</p>
<p>Piptothrix areolaris is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
