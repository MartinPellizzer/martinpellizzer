<p>Plinthus arenarius, commonly known as the sandstone plant, is a rare flowering species native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapted to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered an important indicator species for arid ecosystems.</p>
