<p>Phyllanthus tuamotuensis, commonly known as the Tuamotu phyllanthus, is a flowering plant native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent-like leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, often on sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are usually simple and have a slightly waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its tropical habitat.</p>
