                    <h1>Palmorchis sobralioides</h1>
<p>Palmorchis sobralioides, commonly known as the Sobral's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and is adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its natural habitat. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a unique structure that resembles a palm, hence its common name. It has a delicate, ephemeral bloom period, typically occurring in the late summer months.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
