                    <h1>Polypodium lherminieri</h1>
<p>Polypodium lherminieri, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant has feather-like fronds that are divided into numerous pinnae, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Polypodium lherminieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant.</p>
