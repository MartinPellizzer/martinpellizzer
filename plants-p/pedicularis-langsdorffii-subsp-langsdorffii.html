<p>Pedicularis langsdorffii subsp.</p>
<p>langsdorffii, commonly known as the Langsdorff's lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine regions, thriving in rocky, well-drained soils. Its flowers, which range in color from pink to purple, are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to parts of Asia, including regions of Russia and the Himalayas.</p>
