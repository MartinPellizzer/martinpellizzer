<p>Pseudotsuga taitoensis, commonly known as the Taito fir, is a rare conifer native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It is a member of the pine family (Pinaceae) and is characterized by its slender, conical shape and needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
