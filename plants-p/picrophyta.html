                    <h1>Picrophyta</h1>
<p>Picrophyta, commonly known as the "ghost flower," is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, delicate, and often translucent petals. The plant produces a unique, aromatic nectar that attracts specific pollinators, such as certain species of moths. Picrophyta thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
