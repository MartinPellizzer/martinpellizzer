                    <h1>Physalis lutea</h1>
<p>Physalis lutea, commonly known as the yellow gooseberry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow, berry-like fruits enclosed in a papery, inflated calyx. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with five petals.</p>
<p>The fruit is edible when fully ripe, though it is often used in jams and preserves due to its tart flavor.</p>
