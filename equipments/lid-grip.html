<p>These grips typically consist of a rubber or silicone sleeve that fits snugly onto the lid of a glass jar or container, providing a secure and non-slip surface for handling. By using a lid grip, herbalists can confidently transport and store plant materials, such as dried herbs, flowers, and leaves, without risking contamination or loss.</p>
<p>This equipment is particularly useful for herbalists working with fragile or valuable plant specimens, as it helps to maintain their integrity and preserve their medicinal properties.</p>
