                    <h1>Zygocereus</h1>
<p>Zygocereus, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a genus of cacti native to the Americas.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and nocturnal flowering habit, with large, fragrant flowers that open at night. They typically grow in arid environments and are adapted to store water in their thick, fleshy stems. Zygocereus species often have a branching structure and can reach significant heights, making them popular in xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Their unique blooming pattern makes them a striking addition to any collection of desert plants.</p>
