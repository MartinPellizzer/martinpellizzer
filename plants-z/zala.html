                    <h1>Zala</h1>
<p>Zala, commonly known as the "ghost plant," is a rare and elusive species of flowering plant.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and its ability to thrive in sandy, nutrient-poor soils. Zala produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer, often going unnoticed due to their subtle coloration.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, the zala is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
