                    <h1>Zephyranthes pallida</h1>
<p>Zephyranthes pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. It has strap-like leaves that are often submerged in water, and its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Zephyranthes pallida is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
