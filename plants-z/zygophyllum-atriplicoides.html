                    <h1>Zygophyllum atriplicoides</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum atriplicoides, commonly known as the desert tea or sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum atriplicoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
