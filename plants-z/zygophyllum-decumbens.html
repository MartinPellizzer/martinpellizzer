                    <h1>Zygophyllum decumbens</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum decumbens, commonly known as the desert tea or sandmat, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum decumbens is well adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
