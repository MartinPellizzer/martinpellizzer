<p>Zygophyllum bruguieri, commonly known as the desert tea or sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, often blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through its succulent leaves and deep root system, which help it conserve water. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum bruguieri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
