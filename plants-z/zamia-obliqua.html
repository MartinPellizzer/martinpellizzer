                    <h1>Zamia obliqua</h1>
<p>Zamia obliqua, commonly known as the Mexican palm or zigzag cycad, is a unique member of the Zamiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Mexico and is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like appearance with long, narrow, leathery leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its cycad-like structure and slow growth rate make it a popular choice for collectors and botanical gardens.</p>
<p>Zamia obliqua is also notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to drought conditions.</p>
