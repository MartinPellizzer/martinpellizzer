                    <h1>Zygophyllum incanum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum incanum, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the morning, giving it its common name. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand prolonged drought.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum incanum is often found in coastal and inland sandy areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
