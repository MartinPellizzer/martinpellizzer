                    <h1>Zeocriton maritimum</h1>
<p>Zeocriton maritimum, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal areas, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its life cycle is annual, with seeds dispersed by the wind, allowing it to colonize new areas along the shore.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Zeocriton maritimum make it well-suited for survival in harsh, maritime conditions.</p>
