                    <h1>Zygophyllum glaucum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum glaucum, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in the early morning, followed by the development of distinctive, inflated seed pods. The plant has a low-growing habit with silver-gray foliage, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a waxy coating, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum glaucum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, low-nutrient conditions.</p>
