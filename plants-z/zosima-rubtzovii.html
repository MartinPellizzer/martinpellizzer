<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or violet. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, aiding in moisture retention in its harsh environment.

<p>Its blooming period occurs in late summer, adding a splash of color to the otherwise stark landscape.</p>
