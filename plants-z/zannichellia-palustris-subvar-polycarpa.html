<p>Zannichellia palustris subvar. polycarpa, commonly known as the marsh stellaria, is a aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow waters.</p>
<p>It has small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it produces numerous small, elliptical fruits. The plant has ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish.</p>
<p>This subspecies is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from the water.</p>
