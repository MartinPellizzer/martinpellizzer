<p>Zosterophyllanthos correllii, commonly known as the Texas zosterophyllum, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the arid regions of Texas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zosterophyllaceae and is characterized by its unique, strap-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it access groundwater. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in late spring, and it produces capsule fruits that contain its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zosterophyllanthos correllii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
