                    <h1>Zygostigma australe</h1>
<p>Zygostigma australe, commonly known as the Australian star tortoise, is a unique plant species native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a contrasting central spot. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to the harsh, sunny conditions of its coastal habitat. Its leaves are narrow and linear, contributing to its drought-resistant nature.</p>
<p>Zygostigma australe plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small invertebrates.</p>
