<p>Zostera chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean eelgrass, is a seagrass species native to coastal waters of South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, sandy or muddy substrates in marine environments, typically in temperate to subpolar regions. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that form dense underwater meadows, which provide critical habitat for various marine organisms. It plays a vital role in stabilizing sediments and improving water quality through its dense root system.</p>
<p>Zostera chilensis is also an important food source for marine fauna, including sea turtles and certain fish species.</p>
