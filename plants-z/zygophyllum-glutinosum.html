                    <h1>Zygophyllum glutinosum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum glutinosum, commonly known as sticky zygophyllum, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters, with dense, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom during the rainy season. Its sticky resinous secretions on the stems and leaves serve as a natural defense mechanism against herbivores and moisture loss.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum glutinosum is adapted to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats.</p>
