<p>Zygopetalum binotii, commonly known as the two-banded orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers with distinct color patterns. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients in its native arid environment. Its flowers typically bloom in spring and are known for their intricate, fragrant petals.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Zygopetalum binotii is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
