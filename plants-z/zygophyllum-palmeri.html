                    <h1>Zygophyllum palmeri</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's greasewood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in low-water environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum palmeri plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for various desert organisms.</p>
