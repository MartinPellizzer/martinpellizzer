                    <h1>Zoysia sinica</h1>
<p>Zoysia sinica, commonly known as Chinese zoysia, is a perennial grass native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. It produces small, pale green to brown flowers in late summer, and its rhizomes allow it to spread aggressively.</p>
<p>Zoysia sinica is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and hardiness.</p>
