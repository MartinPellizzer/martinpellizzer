<p>Zannichellia echinata, commonly known as the spiny waterplantain, is a aquatic plant belonging to the Alismataceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged in water, with small, white flowers that emerge above the water surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Its root system helps stabilize sediments, contributing to aquatic ecosystem health.</p>
<p>Zannichellia echinata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in diverse water conditions.</p>
