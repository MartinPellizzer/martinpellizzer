                    <h1>Zygopetalum rigbyanum</h1>
<p>Zygopetalum rigbyanum, commonly known as the Rigby's zygopetalum, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It features vibrant, showy flowers with a unique structure, characterized by a spurred lip and a contrasting coloration between the upper and lower petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for cloud forest ecosystems and its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
