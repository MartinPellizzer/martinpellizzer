<p>Zygophyllum pfeilii, commonly known as the desert raisin, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum pfeilii is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in extreme heat and drought conditions.</p>
