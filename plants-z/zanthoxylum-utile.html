<p>Zanthoxylum utile, commonly known as the prickly ash or yellow prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often mistaken for those of the related species Zanthoxylum clava-herculis. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to red, berry-like fruits, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its bark and twigs contain compounds used in traditional medicine for their stimulant and analgesic properties.</p>
