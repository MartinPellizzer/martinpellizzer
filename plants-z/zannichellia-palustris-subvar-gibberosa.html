                    <h1>Zannichellia palustris subvar. gibberosa</h1>
<p>Zannichellia palustris subvar. gibberosa, commonly known as the broad-leaved water plantain, is a aquatic plant characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, which emerge above the water surface. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the sediment in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>This subvariety is often found in nutrient-rich waters and can form dense mats that provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
