                            <h1>Zornia Diphylla Var. Glochidiata</h1>
<p>Glochidiate zornia, scientifically known as Zornia diphylla var. glochidiata, is a unique flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This species is distinguished by its distinctive glochidiate leaves, which are covered in tiny, barbed hairs that can cause skin irritation. Despite its defensive features, it plays an important ecological role in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in harsh conditions with minimal water. Its presence highlights the adaptability of native flora in challenging landscapes.</p>
