<p>Zosterostylis filiformis, commonly known as the slender spike moss, is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, thread-like leaves and erect, spore-bearing cones.</p>
<p>It is a primitive vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous stem that helps it anchor and spread across the substrate. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are clustered at the tips of the stems and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Zosterostylis filiformis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
