                    <h1>Zanthoxylum coreanum</h1>
<p>Zanthoxylum coreanum, commonly known as the Korean prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in an odd-pinnate pattern, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and some mammals but generally considered bitter by humans. Zanthoxylum coreanum is often found in forest margins and rocky areas, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its woody structure and thorny branches make it a distinctive feature in its natural habitat.</p>
