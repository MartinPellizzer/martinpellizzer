                    <h1>Ziziphus lenticellata</h1>
<p>Ziziphus lenticellata, commonly known as the smooth ziziphus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Australia, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 2â€“5 meters and has small, elliptical leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits. Its bark is characterized by shallow, elongated ridges called lenticels, which aid in gas exchange.</p>
<p>Ziziphus lenticellata is adapted to harsh environments and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
