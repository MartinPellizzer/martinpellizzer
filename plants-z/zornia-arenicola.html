<p>Zornia arenicola, commonly known as sand zornia, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. The plant has small, trifoliate leaves and produces clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions through its deep root system and reduced leaf surface.</p>
<p>Zornia arenicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native environment.</p>
