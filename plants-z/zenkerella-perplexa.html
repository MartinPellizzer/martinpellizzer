                    <h1>Zenkerella perplexa</h1>
<p>Zenkerella perplexa, commonly known as the African ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense rainforests of Central and West Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its striking, translucent, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant's unique morphology includes a short, woody stem and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers, which bloom at night, emit a faint, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Zenkerella perplexa remains a subject of scientific curiosity and conservation interest.</p>
