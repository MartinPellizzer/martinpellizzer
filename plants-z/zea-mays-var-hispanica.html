                    <h1>Zea mays var. hispanica</h1>
<p>Zea mays var. hispanica, commonly known as Spanish maize, is an ancient variety of corn native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, hard kernels and is typically used for animal feed rather than human consumption. This variety is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient crop in challenging environments. Its genetic diversity contributes to the broader maize species, offering valuable traits for modern breeding programs.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 2 meters, with tassels at the top and ears developing along the stalk.</p>
