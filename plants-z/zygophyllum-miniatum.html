                    <h1>Zygophyllum miniatum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum miniatum, commonly known as the dwarf sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum miniatum plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and small mammals.</p>
