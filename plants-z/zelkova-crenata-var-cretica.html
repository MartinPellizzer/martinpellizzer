<p>Zelkova crenata var. cretica, commonly known as the Cretan zelkova, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the island of Crete.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ulmaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that resemble those of maple trees. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. Its bark is thick, fissured, and often flaky, providing a unique texture and appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in Mediterranean ecosystems.</p>
