<p>Zosterophyllanthos crossotus, commonly known as the cross-leaf zosterophyllum, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the order Zosterophyllophyta.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, cross-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. This plant exhibits a unique combination of vascular and non-vascular tissues, reflecting its transitional position between early land plants and more advanced vascular plants. Its leaves are typically thin and ribbon-like, with a prominent midrib that provides structural support.</p>
<p>Zosterophyllanthos crossotus is primarily found in moist, shaded environments, such as along the edges of forested wetlands.</p>
