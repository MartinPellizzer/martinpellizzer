<p>Zygophyllum pinnatum subsp.</p>
<p>chakassicum, commonly known as the Chakassi zygophyllum, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central and East Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dry savanna and steppe habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native environment.</p>
