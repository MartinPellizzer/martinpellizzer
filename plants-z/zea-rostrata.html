<p>Zea rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated maize, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its distinctive rostrum, or beak-like structure, at the tip of its seed head. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in wetland or marshy habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are arranged in a panicle-like structure.</p>
<p>Zea rostrata is primarily of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential role in genetic research.</p>
