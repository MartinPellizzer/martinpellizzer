<p>Zosima bucharica, commonly known as the Buchar's zosima, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 30 centimeters in height, adorned with small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or violet flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Zosima bucharica is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, drought-prone habitats.</p>
