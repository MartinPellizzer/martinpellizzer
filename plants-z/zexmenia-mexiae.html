<p>Zexmenia mexiae, commonly known as the Mexican zexmenia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zingiberaceae, which includes ginger and turmeric, and is characterized by its ornate, fragrant inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and prefers well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a glossy surface, while its flowers display a striking combination of red, yellow, and white hues.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zexmenia mexiae is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
