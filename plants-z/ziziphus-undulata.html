                    <h1>Ziziphus undulata</h1>
<p>Ziziphus undulata, commonly known as the wavy leaf date palm, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often wavy or undulating in appearance, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible fruits resembling dates, though they are typically smaller and less sweet than true dates. It thrives in hot, dry climates and is adapted to poor soils, making it a hardy species for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Ziziphus undulata is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
