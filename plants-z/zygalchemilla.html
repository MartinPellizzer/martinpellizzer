                    <h1>Zygalchemilla</h1>
<p>Zygalchemilla, commonly known as the lesser burrweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces burrs with hooked spines, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing. Zygalchemilla thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
