                    <h1>Zygophyllum schaeferi</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum schaeferi, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a hardy shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deep root system, which allows it to thrive in poor, sandy soils and withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse seeds by wind. Its dense, woody structure provides habitat and shelter for various desert wildlife.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum schaeferi is an important component of desert ecosystems, contributing to soil stability and biodiversity in harsh environments.</p>
