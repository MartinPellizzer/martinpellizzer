                            <h1>Zornia Diphylla Subsp. Latifolia</h1>
<p>Broadleaf zornia, scientifically known as Zornia diphylla subsp. latifolia, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks. Its distinctive foliage and delicate blooms make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively obscure in horticultural circles compared to more commonly cultivated species.</p>
