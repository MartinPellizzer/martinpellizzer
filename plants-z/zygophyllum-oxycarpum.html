<p>Zygophyllum oxycarpum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East, North Africa, and parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum oxycarpum is well-suited to harsh environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
