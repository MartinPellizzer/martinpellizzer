<p>Zerna tectorum, commonly known as the roof grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered at the base of the stems. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it valuable in ecological restoration.</p>
<p>Zerna tectorum is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and minimal maintenance requirements.</p>
