                    <h1>Zygophyllum zanthoxylum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum zanthoxylum, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and grayish-green, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that contain seeds. Zygophyllum zanthoxylum is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in harsh desert conditions, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable species in xerophytic plant communities.</p>
