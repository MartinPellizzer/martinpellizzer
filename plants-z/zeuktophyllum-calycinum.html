                    <h1>Zeuktophyllum calycinum</h1>
<p>Zeuktophyllum calycinum, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Zeuktophyllum calycinum is prized in horticulture for its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
