<p>Zannichellia major, commonly known as the broad-leaved water starwort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and ditches. The plant has long, slender stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are broad, floating, or submerged depending on the water depth. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences.</p>
<p>Zannichellia major is often found in nutrient-rich waters and can serve as an indicator of eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
