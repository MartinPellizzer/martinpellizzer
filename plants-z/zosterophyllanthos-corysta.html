<p>Zosterophyllanthos corysta, commonly known as the coastal zosterophyllum, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the order Zosterophyllales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, ribbon-like leaves that are typically found in shallow marine environments. The plant exhibits a unique structure with a central axis and branching fronds, resembling early forms of vascular plants. Its reproductive structures are not well understood, but it is believed to reproduce through spores.</p>
<p>This plant provides valuable insights into the evolutionary transition from marine to terrestrial life in early plant evolution.</p>
