<p>It features fleshy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats.</p>
