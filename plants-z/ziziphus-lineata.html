                    <h1>Ziziphus lineata</h1>
<p>Ziziphus lineata, commonly known as the desert date or Indian date tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically red or orange when ripe, containing a single seed. Ziziphus lineata is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it an important species in ecological restoration and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen also contributes to soil enrichment in degraded environments.</p>
