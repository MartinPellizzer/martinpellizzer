                    <h1>Zygia inundata</h1>
<p>Zygia inundata, commonly known as the water zygia, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread through vegetative reproduction. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often submerged or floating, adapting to aquatic conditions.</p>
<p>Zygia inundata plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
