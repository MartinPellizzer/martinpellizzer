<p>Zerna irkutensis, commonly known as the Irkutsk millet, is a rare annual grass native to the Siberian region of Russia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils along riverbanks and wetlands. Its seeds are small and hardy, adapted to survive in harsh northern climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zerna irkutensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
