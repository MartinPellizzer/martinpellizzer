                    <h1>Zea mays var. polyxantha</h1>
<p>Zea mays var. polyxantha, commonly known as the Mexican maize or teosinte, is a wild relative of modern corn.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, branching stalks and small, clustered ears of grain. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are broad and pointed, often with a rough texture.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in the genetic diversity of maize, contributing to breeding programs aimed at improving crop resilience.</p>
