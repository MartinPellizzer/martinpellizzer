<p>Zerna fibrosa, commonly known as the fibrous zerna, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in the summer months. Zerna fibrosa is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access groundwater.</p>
