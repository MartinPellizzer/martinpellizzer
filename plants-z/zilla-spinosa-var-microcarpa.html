                    <h1>Zilla spinosa var. microcarpa</h1>
<p>Zilla spinosa var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf zilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, rounded fruits. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
