<p>Ziziphus napeca, commonly known as the Mexican date palm, is a flowering plant in the Rhamnaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible fruits that resemble dates. Its leaves are long, narrow, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Ziziphus napeca is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production.</p>
