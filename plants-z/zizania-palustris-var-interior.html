<p>Zizania palustris var. interior, commonly known as inland wild rice, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, freshwater wetlands and marshes, often forming dense stands that provide habitat for various wildlife. The plant produces long, narrow leaves and spikes of small, rice-like grains that mature in late summer. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to spread vegetatively and stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ecological role in water filtration and as a food source for waterfowl.</p>
