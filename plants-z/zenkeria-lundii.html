                    <h1>Zenkeria lundii</h1>
<p>Zenkeria lundii, commonly known as the African mountain cycad, is a unique cycad species native to eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of long, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones instead of flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth and longevity make it a valuable component of its native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered vulnerable to conservation threats.</p>
