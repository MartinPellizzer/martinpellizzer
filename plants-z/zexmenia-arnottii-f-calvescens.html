                    <h1>Zexmenia arnottii f. calvescens</h1>
<p>Zexmenia arnottii f. calvescens, commonly known as the silky zexmenia, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, silver-green foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs that give it a unique texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and requires well-drained conditions to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
