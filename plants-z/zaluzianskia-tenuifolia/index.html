                            <h1>Zaluzianskia Tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Prairie smoke, scientifically known as Zaluzianskia tenuifolia, is a strikingly unique plant native to the prairies of North America. Its most distinctive feature is the fluffy, smoke-like plumes that appear at the end of its stems, giving it its whimsical common name. This perennial herb thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. With its delicate appearance and ecological importance, it plays a vital role in supporting local wildlife. Despite its fragile look, Prairie smoke is a resilient plant that showcases the beauty of native flora.</p>
