<p>Zea mexicana subsp.</p>
<p>luxurians, commonly known as the Mexican corn or teosinte, is a wild grass species native to central Mexico. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is closely related to modern corn (Zea mays).</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its robust growth, tall stature, and numerous branches, which contribute to its luxuriant appearance. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of the genus Zea.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to domesticated corn, it is of significant interest in agricultural and evolutionary studies.</p>
