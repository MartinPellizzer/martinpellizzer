<p>Zanthoxylum triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically three-lobed, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. Its bark and leaves contain compounds such as lignans and alkaloids, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Zanthoxylum triflorum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets.</p>
