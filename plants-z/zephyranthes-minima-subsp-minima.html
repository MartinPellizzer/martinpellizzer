<p>Zephyranthes minima subsp.</p>
<p>minima, commonly known as the dwarf rain lily, is a small, bulbous plant native to the southeastern United States. It produces delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in response to rainfall, typically in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is well adapted to wet, boggy environments. It is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and ephemeral flowering, it is a challenging but rewarding species for botanical enthusiasts.</p>
