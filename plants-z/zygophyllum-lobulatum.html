                    <h1>Zygophyllum lobulatum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum lobulatum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, sandy environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually small, scale-like, and adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum lobulatum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland ecosystems.</p>
