                    <h1>Zerna canadensis</h1>
<p>Zerna canadensis, commonly known as Canadian wild rye, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Canadian wild rye is also valued for its role in wetland restoration and as a forage plant for wildlife.</p>
