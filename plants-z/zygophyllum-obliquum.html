                    <h1>Zygophyllum obliquum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum obliquum, commonly known as the narrowleaf jointvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb with small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum obliquum is adapted to survive in conditions of extreme heat and limited water availability.</p>
