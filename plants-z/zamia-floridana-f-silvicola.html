                    <h1>Zamia floridana f. silvicola</h1>
<p>Zamia floridana f. silvicola, commonly known as the Florida cycad, is a rare and relict species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones rather than flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
