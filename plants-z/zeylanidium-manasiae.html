<p>Zeylanidium manasiae, commonly known as the Ceylon sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth margin. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered and is protected in its native region.</p>
