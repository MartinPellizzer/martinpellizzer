<p>Zanthoxylum torreyi, commonly known as the Torrey prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3 to 5 inches long and consist of 5 to 9 pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife species. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Zanthoxylum torreyi is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes.</p>
