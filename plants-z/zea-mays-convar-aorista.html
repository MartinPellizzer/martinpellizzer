                    <h1>Zea mays convar. aorista</h1>
<p>Zea mays convar. aorista, commonly known as the wild maize or teosinte, is a wild relative of modern corn.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of multiple branches, which distinguish it from cultivated maize. The plant typically has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with spikelets. Its seeds are enclosed in hard, dry pericarps, and the plant is adapted to a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in the genetic diversity of maize and is studied for its potential in breeding programs.</p>
