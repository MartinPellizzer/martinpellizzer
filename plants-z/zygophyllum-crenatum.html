                    <h1>Zygophyllum crenatum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum crenatum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy, orbicular leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum crenatum is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
