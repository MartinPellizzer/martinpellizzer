<p>Zanthoxylum lucidum, commonly known as the glossy prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but generally considered unpalatable to humans. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
<p>Zanthoxylum lucidum is often found in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
