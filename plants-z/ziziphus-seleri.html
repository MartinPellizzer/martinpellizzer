                    <h1>Ziziphus seleri</h1>
<p>Ziziphus seleri, commonly known as the desert date or wild date, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems, small compound leaves, and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically eaten fresh or used in traditional medicine. Ziziphus seleri is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy fruits and having deep root systems to access groundwater.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife in desert ecosystems.</p>
