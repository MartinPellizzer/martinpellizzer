<p>Zosterophyllanthos nephroglossus, commonly known as the kidney-tongue plant, is a unique species of flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zosterophyllanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, which resembles a kidney shape with a tongue-like extension. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive in partial shade. Its flowers are small and clustered, often producing a delicate pink or white hue, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Zosterophyllanthos nephroglossus is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
