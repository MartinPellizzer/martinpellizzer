<p>Zamia sinuensis, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and palm-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Zamia sinuensis is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or secondary habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
