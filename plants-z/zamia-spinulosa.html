<p>Zamia spinulosa, commonly known as the spinulose cycad, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are often adorned with small, spiny structures called spinules, which give it its common name.</p>
<p>Zamia spinulosa is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and prefers warm, humid climates.</p>
