<p>Zootrophion ildephonsi, commonly known as the Ildephonsian sunspire, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, spiral-shaped inflorescence composed of numerous small, golden-yellow flowers. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its blooming period occurs during the summer months, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Zootrophion ildephonsi is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
