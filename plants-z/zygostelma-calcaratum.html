                    <h1>Zygostelma calcaratum</h1>
<p>Zygostelma calcaratum, commonly known as the sandstone cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its roots are shallow and adapted to quickly absorb moisture after rare rainfalls.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range.</p>
