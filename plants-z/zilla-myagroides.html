<p>Zilla myagroides, commonly known as the yellow marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the spring and summer seasons. The plant typically grows in swampy or seasonally flooded areas, often forming dense colonies in wet soils. Its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively, and it plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
