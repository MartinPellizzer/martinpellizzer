<p>Zoysia serrulata, commonly known as the narrowleaf zoysia, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, narrow leaves that are typically light to medium green in color. The plant forms dense, low-growing turf, making it suitable for lawns and ground cover in warm climates. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, though it can tolerate partial shade.</p>
<p>Zoysia serrulata is also valued for its ability to suppress weeds and its relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
