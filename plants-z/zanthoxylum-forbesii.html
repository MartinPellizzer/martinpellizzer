                    <h1>Zanthoxylum forbesii</h1>
<p>Zanthoxylum forbesii, commonly known as Forbes' prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but generally considered toxic to humans.</p>
<p>Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and adaptability to woodland habitats.</p>
