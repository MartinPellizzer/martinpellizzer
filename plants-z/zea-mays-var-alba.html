                    <h1>Zea mays var. alba</h1>
<p>Zea mays var. alba, commonly known as white maize, is a variant of maize characterized by its pale or white kernels instead of the typical yellow or blue.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family, Poaceae, and is native to the Americas, particularly Mexico. The plant typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 3 meters, with tall, slender stalks and large, narrow leaves. Its flowers are spike-like, with male and female inflorescences separated, and it is primarily cultivated for its starchy seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is less common in modern agriculture but holds cultural and historical significance in some indigenous communities.</p>
