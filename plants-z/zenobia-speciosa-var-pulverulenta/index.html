<p>Pulverulent zenobia, scientifically known as Zenobia speciosa var. pulverulenta, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family. This unique variant is distinguished by its finely powdered, dust-like petals that create a mesmerizing visual effect under light. Native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia, it thrives in cool, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its delicate beauty makes it a coveted specimen among plant enthusiasts and botanists alike. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, conservation efforts are crucial to ensuring its survival.</p>
