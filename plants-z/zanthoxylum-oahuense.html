<p>Zanthoxylum oahuense, commonly known as the Oahu prickly ash, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Hawaiian island of Oahu.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for native birds and insects. It thrives in coastal and lowland habitats, often growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
