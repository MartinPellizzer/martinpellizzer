<p>Zosima leiophylla, commonly known as the smooth-leaf zosima, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and glossy, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zosima leiophylla is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
