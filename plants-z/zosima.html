                    <h1>Zosima</h1>
<p>Zosima, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils. The plant produces small, white flowers that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. Zosima has a slow growth rate and is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a marker species for ecological health.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
