                    <h1>Zamia portoricensis</h1>
<p>Zamia portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican cycad, is a rare gymnosperm native to the island of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
