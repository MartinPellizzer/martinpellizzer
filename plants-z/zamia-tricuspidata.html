<p>Zamia tricuspidata, commonly known as the three-pointed cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is a dioecious plant, meaning that male and female reproductive structures are found on separate individuals. The plant produces large, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. Its cones, which contain the plant's reproductive organs, are either male or female and are borne on separate plants.</p>
<p>Zamia tricuspidata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
