                    <h1>Zyzyxia</h1>
<p>Zyzyxia, commonly known as the moonflower or nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their showy, white or pale flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Zyzyxia species typically have tubular or bell-shaped flowers and are often found in moist, shady environments. They produce small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds, and some species are cultivated for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Zyzyxia silvestris and Zyzyxia montana, which are native to North America.</p>
