                    <h1>Zexmenia arnottii f. rupestris</h1>
<p>Zexmenia arnottii f. rupestris, commonly known as the rock zexmenia, is a rare and unique plant species native to the rocky outcrops of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and small, dense leaves that are adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically from June to August. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
