<p>Zamia herrerae, commonly known as the Herrera's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Zamia herrerae is considered vulnerable to extinction.</p>
