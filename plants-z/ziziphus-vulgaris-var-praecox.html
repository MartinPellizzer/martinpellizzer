                    <h1>Ziziphus vulgaris var. praecox</h1>
<p>Ziziphus vulgaris var. praecox, commonly known as early date palm, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to edible fruits resembling dates, though they are typically smaller and less sweet than those of the common date palm. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this variety make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>
