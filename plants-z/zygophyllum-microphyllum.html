                    <h1>Zygophyllum microphyllum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is adapted to absorb moisture from deep within the soil, allowing it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum microphyllum plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
