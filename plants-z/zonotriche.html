<p>Zonotriche, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Zonotriche, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are hemiparasitic, meaning they derive some nutrients from their host plants while also performing photosynthesis. Zonotriche species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on trees. Their leaves are usually small and opposite, and they produce small, clustered flowers.</p>
<p>The fruits are generally berries, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
