                    <h1>Zosterophyllanthos oxapampae</h1>
<p>Zosterophyllanthos oxapampae, commonly known as the Oxapampa zosterophyll, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zosterophyllaceae, which is characterized by its specialized reproductive structures and adaptations to extreme environments. The plant exhibits a distinctive morphology with elongated, ribbon-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing protection against harsh weather conditions. Its growth habit is typically low and mat-forming, allowing it to thrive in rocky, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zosterophyllanthos oxapampae is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
