                    <h1>Zygophyllum zilloides</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum zilloides, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Its flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, adapting to the intense heat of the desert environment.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum zilloides plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
