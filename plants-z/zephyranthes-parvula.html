                    <h1>Zephyranthes parvula</h1>
<p>Zephyranthes parvula, commonly known as the rain lily, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in response to rainfall, often appearing after thunderstorms. The plant typically grows from a bulbous base, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are evergreen in warm climates. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its short blooming period and ephemeral nature, it is often referred to as a "transient beauty" in the botanical world.</p>
