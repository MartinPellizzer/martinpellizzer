                    <h1>Zanthoxylum arenosum</h1>
<p>Zanthoxylum arenosum, commonly known as the sand thorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually reduced to spines in mature plants, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife but contain toxic compounds for humans. It is adapted to survive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptations to its arid habitat.</p>
