                    <h1>Zizania effusa</h1>
<p>Zizania effusa, commonly known as giant calamus, is a tall, aquatic grass native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes, often forming dense stands. The plant has long, narrow leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length, and it produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, contributing to its ability to thrive in muddy, nutrient-rich environments.</p>
<p>Zizania effusa plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
