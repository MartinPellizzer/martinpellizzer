                    <h1>Zannichellia palustris var. major</h1>
<p>Zannichellia palustris var. major, commonly known as the greater marsh pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which emerge above the water surface during the summer months. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish.</p>
<p>Zannichellia palustris var. major is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments and improve water quality.</p>
