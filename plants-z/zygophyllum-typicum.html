<p>Zygophyllum typicum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can survive with minimal water.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum typicum plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
