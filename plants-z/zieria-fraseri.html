<p>Zieria fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's zieria, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 1 meter and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer months. These flowers are followed by small, red or purple berries that are edible but not particularly palatable.</p>
<p>Zieria fraseri is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes.</p>
