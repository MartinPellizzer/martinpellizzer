                    <h1>Zizania</h1>
<p>Zizania, commonly known as wild rice, is a genus of aquatic grasses native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It includes several species, such as Zizania aquatica and Zizania latifolia, which are characterized by their tall, slender stems and large, paddle-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments, often found in wetlands, rivers, and lakes. Its seeds, which are harvested for food, are encased in a hard outer shell and require specific conditions for germination.</p>
<p>Zizania plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
