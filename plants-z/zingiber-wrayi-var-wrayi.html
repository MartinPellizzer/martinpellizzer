                    <h1>Zingiber wrayi var. wrayi</h1>
<p>Zingiber wrayi var. wrayi, commonly known as the Wray's ginger, is a rare and distinctive member of the Zingiberaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the mountainous areas of Thailand and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, orchid-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. Its rhizome, like other gingers, is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
