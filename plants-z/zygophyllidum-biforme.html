<p>It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae, characterized by its small, often spiny leaves and showy, yellow or red flowers. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are typically trifoliate or pinnately compound, and the flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Zygophyllidum biforme plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife in its ecosystem.</p>
