<p>Zygophyllum aurantiacum subsp.</p>
<p>verticillatum, commonly known as the red sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its clusters of small, bright orange to red flowers.</p>
<p>The plant has trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is adapted to thrive in sandy soils with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
