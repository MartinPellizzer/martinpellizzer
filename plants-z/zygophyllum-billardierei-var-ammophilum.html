                    <h1>Zygophyllum billardierei var. ammophilum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum billardierei var. ammophilum, commonly known as the sandblush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, yellowish-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This variety is often found on sandy soils and is well-suited to harsh, coastal or inland desert conditions.</p>
