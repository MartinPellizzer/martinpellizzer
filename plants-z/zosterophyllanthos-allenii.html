                    <h1>Zosterophyllanthos allenii</h1>
<p>Zosterophyllanthos allenii, commonly known as the Allen's zosterophyllum, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the order Zosterophyllophytina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring small, ribbon-like leaves arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. This plant is often found in coastal or brackish environments, where it thrives in intertidal zones. Its structure suggests a close evolutionary relationship with early land plants, making it significant in the study of plant evolution.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
