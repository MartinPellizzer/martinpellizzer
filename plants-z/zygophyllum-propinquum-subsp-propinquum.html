<p>Zygophyllum propinquum subsp.</p>
<p>propinquum, commonly known as the coastal prickly-pear, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>The plant has adapted to arid and saline environments, making it resilient to drought and high salinity. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its stems store water for survival.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small animals.</p>
