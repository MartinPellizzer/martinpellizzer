                    <h1>Zygophlebia eminens</h1>
<p>Zygophlebia eminens, commonly known as the tall mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or pale flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria, while it also performs photosynthesis. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species.</p>
