                    <h1>Zamia angustifolia var. floridana</h1>
<p>Zamia angustifolia var. floridana, commonly known as the Florida stegostemon, is a cycad-like plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a rosette of dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a terminal, cone-like structure that contains both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
