<p>Zornia glabella, commonly known as the hairy zornia, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Zornia glabella is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules, which can improve soil fertility.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots and drought-tolerant nature make it an important pioneer species in arid environments.</p>
