<p>Zamia angustifolia var. yatesii, commonly known as the Yate's slender cycad, is a dioecious plant belonging to the Zamiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
