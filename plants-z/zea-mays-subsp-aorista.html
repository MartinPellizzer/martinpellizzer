<p>Zea mays subsp.</p>
<p>aorista, commonly known as the Mexican teosinte, is a wild relative of maize native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant typically has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces both male and female flowers on separate plants. Its genetic diversity plays a crucial role in the domestication history of maize.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is considered a key species in understanding the evolution of cereal crops.</p>
