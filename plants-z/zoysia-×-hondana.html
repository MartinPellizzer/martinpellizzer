                    <h1>Zoysia × hondana</h1>
<p>Zoysia × hondana, commonly known as the hybrid zoysia grass, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Zoysia japonica and Zoysia matrella.</p>
<p>It exhibits a dense, fine-textured turf that is highly valued for its durability and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color, and it forms a mat-like growth pattern that suppresses weed growth. It is commonly used in lawns and sports fields due to its tolerance to heat and moderate foot traffic.</p>
<p>However, it does not produce seeds and is typically propagated through sod or plugs.</p>
