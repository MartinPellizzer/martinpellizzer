                    <h1>Ziziphus horrida</h1>
<p>Ziziphus horrida, commonly known as the rough ziziphus, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny branches, small greenish-yellow flowers, and edible, tart berries that are often consumed by wildlife and humans. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various animals.</p>
<p>Ziziphus horrida is also valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
