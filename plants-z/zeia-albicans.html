                    <h1>Zeia albicans</h1>
<p>Zeia albicans, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Zeia albicans is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
