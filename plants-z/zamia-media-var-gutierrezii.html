                    <h1>Zamia media var. gutierrezii</h1>
<p>Zamia media var. gutierrezii, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Yucat√°n Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and exhibits a distinctive appearance with a stout, trunk-like stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
