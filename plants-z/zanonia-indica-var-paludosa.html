                    <h1>Zanonia indica var. paludosa</h1>
<p>Zanonia indica var. paludosa, commonly known as the swamp zanonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshy or swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its preferred environment.</p>
<p>Zanonia indica var. paludosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
