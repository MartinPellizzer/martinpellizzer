                    <h1>Zygopetalum placantherum</h1>
<p>Zygopetalum placantherum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, spurred flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Its botanical features include a pseudobulb structure and long, strap-like leaves that help it conserve water in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zygopetalum placantherum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
