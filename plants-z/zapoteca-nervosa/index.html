                            <h1>Zapoteca Nervosa</h1>
<p>Zapoteca nervosa is a lesser-known but fascinating species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. This plant thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests and tropical highlands. Its unique leaf structure and vibrant blooms make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike. Despite its beauty, Zapoteca nervosa remains relatively understudied, highlighting the need for further research and conservation efforts.</p>
