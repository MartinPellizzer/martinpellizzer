                    <h1>Zea mays var. syrtica</h1>
<p>Zea mays var. syrtica, commonly known as the Syrtic maize, is a variant of maize native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced leaf surface area, which helps it withstand harsh, drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, tightly packed ears of grain, often with a high proportion of starchy kernels. Its genetic makeup reflects adaptations to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable crop in marginal agricultural zones.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it has been studied for its potential in sustainable farming practices in challenging climates.</p>
