<p>Zygophyllum flavum, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb with small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are usually small and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum flavum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
