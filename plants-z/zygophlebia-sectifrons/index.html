                            <h1>Zygophlebia Sectifrons</h1>
<p>Common bottle palm, scientifically known as Zygophlebia sectifrons, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is named for its distinctive bottle-shaped trunk that grows slowly over time. This palm thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and landscape design. Despite its beauty, it requires careful cultivation to ensure its survival in non-native environments.</p>
