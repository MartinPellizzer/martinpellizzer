                    <h1>Zostera capensis f. elatior</h1>
<p>Zostera capensis f. elatior, commonly known as the greater sea grass, is a variant of the sea grass species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, adapted for life in shallow, brackish or marine environments. It forms dense underwater meadows that provide critical habitat and shelter for a variety of marine organisms. The plant is submerged for most of the year, with its rhizomes anchoring it to the seabed.</p>
<p>Zostera capensis f. elatior plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and supporting biodiversity.</p>
