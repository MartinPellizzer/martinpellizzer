<p>Ziziphus gardneri, commonly known as Gardner's ziziphus, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green berries that ripen in the fall. The plant has small, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of white flowers in the spring. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Ziziphus gardneri is often found in rocky soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness.</p>
