                    <h1>Zosterophyllanthos cardiothallis</h1>
<p>Zosterophyllanthos cardiothallis, commonly known as the heart-thallus zosterophyllum, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the order Zosterophylloideae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a central stem with branching structures that resemble a heart shape, giving it its common name. The plant exhibits a complex vascular system, suggesting an advanced level of evolution for its time. It is typically found in specific coastal environments, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable subject for studying early plant evolution.</p>
