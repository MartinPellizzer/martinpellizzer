                    <h1>Zea mays var. leucoceras</h1>
<p>Zea mays var. leucoceras, commonly known as white corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its white or pale yellow kernels.</p>
<p>This variety is native to the Americas and has been cultivated for thousands of years by indigenous peoples. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 meters, with tall, leafy stalks and tassels at the top. Its botanical features include hollow stems, parallel-veined leaves, and a panicle-type inflorescence.</p>
<p>The kernels are enclosed in a hard, fibrous layer called the pericarp, which protects the starchy endosperm.</p>
