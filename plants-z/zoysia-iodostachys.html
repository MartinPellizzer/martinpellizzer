                    <h1>Zoysia iodostachys</h1>
<p>Zoysia iodostachys, commonly known as the coastal zoysia, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fine-textured foliage and its ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or violet, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form thick mats, making it suitable for erosion control in coastal environments.</p>
<p>Zoysia iodostachys is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience to coastal conditions.</p>
