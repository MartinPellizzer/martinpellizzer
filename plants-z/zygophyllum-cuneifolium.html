                    <h1>Zygophyllum cuneifolium</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved zygophyllum, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, spiny stems and narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
