                    <h1>Zizaniopsis villanensis</h1>
<p>Zizaniopsis villanensis, commonly known as the Mexican flat sedge, is a perennial grass native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland and riparian habitats, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable wetland plant and a potential invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
<p>Zizaniopsis villanensis plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland biodiversity and water quality.</p>
