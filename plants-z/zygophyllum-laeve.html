                    <h1>Zygophyllum laeve</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum laeve, commonly known as the smooth zygophyllum, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum laeve plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
