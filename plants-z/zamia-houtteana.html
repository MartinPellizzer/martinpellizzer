<p>Zamia houtteana, commonly known as the Houtte's cycad, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber.</p>
<p>Zamia houtteana is also valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
