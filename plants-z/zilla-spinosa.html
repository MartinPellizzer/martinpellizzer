                    <h1>Zilla spinosa</h1>
<p>Zilla spinosa, commonly known as the spiny zilla, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by oval, woody fruits that contain seeds. Zilla spinosa thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in desert ecosystems.</p>
