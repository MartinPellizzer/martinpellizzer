<p>Zahleria zahlbruckneri, commonly known as the mountain mistflower, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. It is often found in rocky or wooded areas at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is highly susceptible to environmental changes and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
