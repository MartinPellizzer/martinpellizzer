                    <h1>Zapoteca alinae</h1>
<p>Zapoteca alinae, commonly known as the Alinae zapoteca, is a rare flowering plant native to the highlands of Oaxaca, Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and restricted range make it a valuable subject for ecological and genetic studies.</p>
