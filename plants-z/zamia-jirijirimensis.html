                    <h1>Zamia jirijirimensis</h1>
<p>Zamia jirijirimensis, commonly known as the Jirijirimensis cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zamia jirijirimensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
