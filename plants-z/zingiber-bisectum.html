<p>Zingiber bisectum, commonly known as the split ginger, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like ginger and turmeric. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in inflorescences. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated compared to other ginger species due to its specific growing requirements.</p>
