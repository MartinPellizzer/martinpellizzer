                    <h1>Zehneria microsperma</h1>
<p>Zehneria microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded zehneria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family, which includes many ornamental and horticulturally valuable species. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zehneria microsperma is considered a conservation concern.</p>
