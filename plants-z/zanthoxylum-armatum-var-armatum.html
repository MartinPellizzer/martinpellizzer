                    <h1>Zanthoxylum armatum var. armatum</h1>
<p>Zanthoxylum armatum var. armatum, commonly known as the prickly ash or simply prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. Its bark and twigs contain compounds with historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The plant is also notable for its defensive spines, which deter herbivores and contribute to its ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
