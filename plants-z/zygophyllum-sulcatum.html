<p>Zygophyllum sulcatum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum sulcatum is well adapted to desert life, showcasing remarkable resilience to extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
