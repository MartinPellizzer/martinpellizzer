                    <h1>Zostera marina var. major</h1>
<p>Zostera marina var. major, commonly known as the large eelgrass, is a seagrass species found in coastal marine environments.</p>
<p>It has long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically green and blade-like, adapted for underwater photosynthesis. This variety is characterized by its larger leaves compared to the typical Zostera marina, which contributes to its name. It plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The plant is also important for carbon sequestration and supporting biodiversity in shallow coastal waters.</p>
