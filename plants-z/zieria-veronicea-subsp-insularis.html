<p>Zieria veronicea subsp.</p>
<p>insularis, commonly known as the island zieria, is a small shrub native to the island of Tasmania. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in heathlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
