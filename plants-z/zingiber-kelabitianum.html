<p>Zingiber kelabitianum, commonly known as the Kelabit ginger, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Zingiberaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the remote highlands of Borneo, particularly in the Kelabit region of Sarawak, Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender rhizomes and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, with a subtle fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zingiber kelabitianum is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
