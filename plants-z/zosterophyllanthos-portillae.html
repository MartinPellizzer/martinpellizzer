                    <h1>Zosterophyllanthos portillae</h1>
<p>Zosterophyllanthos portillae, commonly known as the Portilla's zosterophyllum, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the order Zosterophyllales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring elongated, ribbon-like leaves that resemble those of early land plants. The plant exhibits a simple vascular system, suggesting evolutionary links to early terrestrial flora. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of great interest to botanists studying plant evolution.</p>
