<p>Zamia × katzeriana, commonly known as the hybrid cycad, is a fascinating plant that belongs to the family Zamiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Zamia pumila and Zamia montii, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often dark green and glossy. Its reproductive structures include a large, cone-like structure called a strobilus, which produces both pollen and seeds.</p>
<p>Zamia × katzeriana is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
