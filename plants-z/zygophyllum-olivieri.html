                    <h1>Zygophyllum olivieri</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum olivieri, commonly known as the desert fanflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and Southwestern Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub or subshrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, exhibiting a low, spreading growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish or reddish flowers clustered in fan-like inflorescences, which bloom during the warm season. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum olivieri is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems.</p>
