                    <h1>Zea mays var. rhodornis</h1>
<p>Zea mays var. rhodornis, commonly known as the purple corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its striking purple pigmentation.</p>
<p>This coloration is primarily due to the presence of anthocyanins, which are water-soluble pigments responsible for the vibrant hues in many fruits and vegetables. The plant typically grows as an annual grass with tall stalks and tassels, similar to other corn varieties. Its leaves are broad and green, while the ears of corn develop in shades of purple, red, and even black.</p>
<p>This variety is not only ornamental but also valued for its nutritional content and use in traditional foods.</p>
