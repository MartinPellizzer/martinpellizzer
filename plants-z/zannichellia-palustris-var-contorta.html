                    <h1>Zannichellia palustris var. contorta</h1>
<p>Zannichellia palustris var. contorta, commonly known as the bentweed, is a aquatic plant characterized by its ribbon-like leaves that are typically narrow and twisted.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands, where it can anchor itself to substrates with its rhizomes. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are often submerged or just at the water's surface. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Zannichellia palustris var. contorta is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments and improve water quality.</p>
