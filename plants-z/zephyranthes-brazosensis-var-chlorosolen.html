                    <h1>Zephyranthes brazosensis var. chlorosolen</h1>
<p>Zephyranthes brazosensis var. chlorosolen, commonly known as the green sun orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright green petals and a yellowish-white flower spike, which distinguish it from other Zephyranthes species. Native to the wetlands of Texas, this plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its unique coloration is due to the presence of chlorophyll in the petals, a trait uncommon in most orchids.</p>
<p>This variant is highly valued by botanists and horticulturists for its ecological significance and ornamental appeal.</p>
