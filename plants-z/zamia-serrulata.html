                    <h1>Zamia serrulata</h1>
<p>Zamia serrulata, commonly known as the serrulate cycad, is a species of cycad native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
