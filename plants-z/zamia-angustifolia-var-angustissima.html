                    <h1>Zamia angustifolia var. angustissima</h1>
<p>Zamia angustifolia var. angustissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, strap-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
