                    <h1>Zygophyllum howittii</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum howittii, commonly known as the Howitt's prickly scalebush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive drought conditions. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum howittii plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
