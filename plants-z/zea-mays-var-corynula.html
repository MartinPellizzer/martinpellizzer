                    <h1>Zea mays var. corynula</h1>
<p>Zea mays var. corynula, commonly known as the Mexican teosinte, is a wild relative of modern corn.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact stature, with multiple branches and small, hard, inedible seeds. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in warm, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tassels and ears similar to maize but with a more primitive structure.</p>
<p>This variety is significant in the study of maize domestication due to its genetic relationship to cultivated corn.</p>
