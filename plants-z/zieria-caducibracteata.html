                    <h1>Zieria caducibracteata</h1>
<p>Zieria caducibracteata, commonly known as the hairy zieria, is a small, shrub-like plant native to the south-western region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in heathlands and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the autumn season, which are borne on short, hairy pedicels. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>Zieria caducibracteata is well adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>
