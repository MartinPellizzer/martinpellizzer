<p>Zaluzianskia concinna, commonly known as the scarlet globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. The plant produces showy, bright red or orange-yellow flowers that are clustered in globular inflorescences, which are characteristic of the Malvaceae family. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to drought conditions.</p>
