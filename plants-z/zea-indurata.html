                    <h1>Zea indurata</h1>
<p>Zea indurata, commonly known as the hardstem maize, is a species of grass native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rigid, fibrous stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Zea indurata is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject in studies of grassland ecology and plant adaptation.</p>
