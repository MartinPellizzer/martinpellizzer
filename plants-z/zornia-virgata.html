<p>Zornia virgata, commonly known as the Virginia zornia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Zornia virgata is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria.</p>
