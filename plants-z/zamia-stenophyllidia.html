<p>Zamia stenophyllidia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
