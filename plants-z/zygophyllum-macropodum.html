                    <h1>Zygophyllum macropodum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum macropodum, commonly known as the large-footed zygophyllum, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, pale green to yellowish leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum macropodum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert fauna.</p>
