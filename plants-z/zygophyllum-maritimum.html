<p>Zygophyllum maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with silver-gray foliage and striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to salty and arid environments, featuring a deep root system and waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help protect against harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum maritimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil.</p>
