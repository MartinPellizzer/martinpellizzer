<p>Zea mays var. pyracra, commonly known as the purple corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its striking violet to purple-colored kernels.</p>
<p>This plant is native to the Andean regions of South America, where it has been cultivated for centuries by indigenous communities. The botanical features include tall stalks with broad, lance-shaped leaves and compact tassels at the top. Its unique pigmentation is due to high concentrations of anthocyanins, which also contribute to its nutritional value.</p>
