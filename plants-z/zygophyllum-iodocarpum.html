                    <h1>Zygophyllum iodocarpum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum iodocarpum, commonly known as saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent, often blue-green leaves. The plant is well adapted to saline and drought-prone environments, making it a common component of coastal and inland shrublands. Its ability to thrive in poor soils and high salinity makes it ecologically significant in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native fauna.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum iodocarpum is also used in some traditional practices and has potential applications in phytoremediation.</p>
