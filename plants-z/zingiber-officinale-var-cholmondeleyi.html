                    <h1>Zingiber officinale var. cholmondeleyi</h1>
<p>Zingiber officinale var. cholmondeleyi, commonly known as the red ginger, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange colored flower bracts, which are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that is similar to common ginger (Zingiber officinale), but it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its culinary use. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and have a glossy texture, contributing to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>While not typically used in cooking, it shares some chemical compounds with other ginger species, making it of interest in botanical and horticultural studies.</p>
