<p>Zanthoxylum sapindifolium, commonly known as the Mexican prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually pinnately arranged and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but generally considered toxic to humans. Zanthoxylum sapindifolium is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses have made it a subject of interest in botanical and ecological studies.</p>
