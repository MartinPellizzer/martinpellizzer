                    <h1>Zygophyllum decumbens var. megacarpum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum decumbens var. megacarpum, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, spreading growth habit and small, leathery leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hardy nature makes it well adapted to poor soils and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>The large, woody fruits of this variety are important food sources for various desert animals.</p>
