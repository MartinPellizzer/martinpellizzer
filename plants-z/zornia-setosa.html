                    <h1>Zornia setosa</h1>
<p>Zornia setosa, commonly known as the slender zornia, is a low-growing annual herb native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open fields and along roadsides. Its small, oval seeds are enclosed in a pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Zornia setosa is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment.</p>
