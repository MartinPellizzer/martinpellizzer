<p>Zannichellia palustris subsp.</p>
<p>tenuis, commonly known as the slender water-pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows.</p>
<p>The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that are often submerged. It is an important part of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for clean water, it is also used as an indicator species for water quality.</p>
