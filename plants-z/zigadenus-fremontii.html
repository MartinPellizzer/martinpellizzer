<p>Zigadenus fremontii, commonly known as the fremont's death camas, is a toxic perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces a bulbous rhizome and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its toxicity is due to the presence of various alkaloids, making it highly dangerous to both humans and animals.</p>
<p>Despite its harmful properties, it plays a role in local ecosystems and is sometimes used in botanical studies for its unique morphology and chemical composition.</p>
