                    <h1>Zostera caespitosa</h1>
<p>Zostera caespitosa, commonly known as eelgrass, is a marine flowering plant found in coastal waters of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It forms dense underwater meadows that provide essential habitat and nursery grounds for various marine species. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically bright green and can grow up to several meters in length. It reproduces through both sexual and asexual means, with flowering occurring in summer and seed dispersal facilitated by water currents.</p>
<p>Zostera caespitosa plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and improving water quality in coastal ecosystems.</p>
