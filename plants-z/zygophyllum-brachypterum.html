<p>Zygophyllum brachypterum, commonly known as the narrow-winged sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or subshrub with small, fleshy, often blue or purple leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum brachypterum is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in harsh climates.</p>
