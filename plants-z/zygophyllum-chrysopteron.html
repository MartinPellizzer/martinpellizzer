<p>Zygophyllum chrysopteron, commonly known as the golden sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, which are often mistaken for fruits. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
