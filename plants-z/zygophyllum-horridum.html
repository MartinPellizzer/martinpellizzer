                    <h1>Zygophyllum horridum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum horridum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually reduced to small scales, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum horridum is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
