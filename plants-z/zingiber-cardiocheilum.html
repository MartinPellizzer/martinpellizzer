                    <h1>Zingiber cardiocheilum</h1>
<p>Zingiber cardiocheilum, commonly known as the heart-lipped ginger, is a rare and striking member of the Zingiberaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Thailand and Myanmar. The plant is characterized by its ornamental, tubular flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, with a unique heart-shaped lip. Its rhizomes are similar to those of other gingers but are less commonly used in culinary applications.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zingiber cardiocheilum is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
