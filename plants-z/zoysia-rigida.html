                    <h1>Zoysia rigida</h1>
<p>Zoysia rigida, commonly known as rigid zoysia, is a perennial grass species native to China and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fine-textured foliage and forms a thick, carpet-like turf. The plant has rhizomes and stolons that enable it to spread and establish a vigorous root system. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Its ability to withstand foot traffic makes it a popular choice for lawns and erosion control in suitable climates.</p>
