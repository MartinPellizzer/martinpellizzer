<p>Zexmenia pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate forests of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often beneath the canopy of pine trees. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Zexmenia pinetorum is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
