                    <h1>Zea mays var. vulgaris-autumna</h1>
<p>Zea mays var. vulgaris-autumna, commonly known as the autumn corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its late-season maturation.</p>
<p>This plant typically exhibits shorter stalks and broader leaves compared to standard corn varieties, adapting to cooler temperatures. Its ears develop later in the growing season, often ripening in the fall rather than summer. The kernels are usually smaller and more densely packed, with a distinct coloration that can range from pale yellow to deep orange.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is valued for its resilience in temperate climates and its role in traditional agricultural practices.</p>
