<p>Zeylanidium barberi, commonly known as the Ceylon sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fragrant, yellowish wood that is highly valued in the perfume and incense industries. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered critically endangered in its native range.</p>
