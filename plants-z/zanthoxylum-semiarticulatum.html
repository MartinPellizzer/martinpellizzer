                    <h1>Zanthoxylum semiarticulatum</h1>
<p>Zanthoxylum semiarticulatum, commonly known as the Mexican prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a spicy, peppery flavor due to the presence of alkaloids. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and medicinal properties have made it a subject of interest in horticulture and traditional herbal practices.</p>
