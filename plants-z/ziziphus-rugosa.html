                    <h1>Ziziphus rugosa</h1>
<p>Ziziphus rugosa, commonly known as the Chinese date or rough date, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered in a rough, fissured bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to edible, fleshy berries resembling dates in appearance. These berries are typically red to orange when ripe and are consumed both fresh and dried.</p>
<p>Ziziphus rugosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
