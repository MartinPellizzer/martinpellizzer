<p>Zygophyllum fabago subsp.</p>
<p>orientale, commonly known as the oriental sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are often reduced to small scales, and the stems are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
