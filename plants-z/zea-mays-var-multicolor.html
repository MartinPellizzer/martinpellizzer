<p>Zea mays var. multicolor, commonly known as multicolored corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its vibrant, variegated leaf patterns.</p>
<p>This plant exhibits a wide range of coloration, including green, red, purple, and white, due to genetic mutations affecting chlorophyll production. It is typically cultivated as an ornamental plant rather than for grain production. The multicolored leaves make it a popular choice for gardens and botanical displays.</p>
<p>Its growth habit is similar to standard maize, with tall stalks and tassels at the top.</p>
