<p>Zygoruellia richardii, commonly known as the Richard's zygoruellia, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its botanical features include small, ovate leaves with a serrated margin and a unique floral structure that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zygoruellia richardii is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
