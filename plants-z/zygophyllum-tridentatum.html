                    <h1>Zygophyllum tridentatum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum tridentatum, commonly known as the three-toothed silverleaf, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are typically covered in a whitish, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum tridentatum is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that plays a role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems.</p>
