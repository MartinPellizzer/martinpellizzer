<p>Zygostigma, commonly known as the white mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in early spring. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain toxic seeds.</p>
<p>Zygostigma is native to regions in Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it plays a role in local ecosystems despite its parasitic nature.</p>
