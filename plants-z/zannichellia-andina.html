                    <h1>Zannichellia andina</h1>
<p>Zannichellia andina, commonly known as the Andean water starwort, is a aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the sediment. It produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, often in the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>Zannichellia andina plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
