                    <h1>Zamia vazquezii</h1>
<p>Zamia vazquezii, commonly known as the VÃ¡zquez cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the tropical regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, woody trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Zamia vazquezii is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
