<p>Zamia lawsoniana, commonly known as the Lawson's cycad, is a species of cycad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
