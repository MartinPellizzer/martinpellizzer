<p>Zealandia pustulata subsp.</p>
<p>howensis, commonly known as the Howen's bladder fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, bladder-like spore cases that are unique to this subspecies.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually lance-shaped with a waxy coating, and it produces sporangia that are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
