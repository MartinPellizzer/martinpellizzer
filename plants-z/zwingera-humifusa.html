<p>Zwingera humifusa, commonly known as the ground-leaf zwingera, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Zwingera humifusa thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
