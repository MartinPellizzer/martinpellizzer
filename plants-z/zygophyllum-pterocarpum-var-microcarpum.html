<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
