                    <h1>Zygophyllum densispinum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum densispinum, commonly known as the dense-spined zygophyllum, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its dense spines provide protection from herbivores, while its deep root system allows it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum densispinum is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
