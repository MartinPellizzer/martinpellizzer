<p>Zygopetalum forcipatum, commonly known as the clawed orchid, is a species native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact, low-growing growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in high-altitude, often cold environments. Its flowers are characterized by a distinctive, claw-like lip that aids in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Zygopetalum forcipatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in cooler climates.</p>
