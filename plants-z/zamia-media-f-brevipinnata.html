                    <h1>Zamia media f. brevipinnata</h1>
<p>Zamia media f. brevipinnata, commonly known as the short-pinnate cycad, is a distinctive member of the Zamiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its unique, compound leaves that are shorter and more densely arranged compared to the typical Zamia species. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with a male strobilus and a female ovulate cone, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
