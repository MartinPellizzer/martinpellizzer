                    <h1>Zygophyllum botulifolium</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum botulifolium, commonly known as the bladderleaf desertweed, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy, bladder-like leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater and survive prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum botulifolium plays a vital role in stabilizing desert soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
