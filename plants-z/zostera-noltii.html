<p>Zostera noltii, commonly known as shoal grass, is a seagrass species native to coastal regions of the northern Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It forms dense underwater meadows that provide essential habitat and food for various marine organisms. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically ribbon-like in appearance, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in shallow waters. Zostera noltii thrives in sandy or muddy substrates and is often found in estuaries and tidal zones.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of healthy coastal ecosystems and plays a vital role in stabilizing sediments and improving water quality.</p>
