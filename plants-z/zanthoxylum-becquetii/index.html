                            <h1>Zanthoxylum Becquetii</h1>
<p>Becquet's prickly ash, scientifically known as Zanthoxylum becquetii, is a rare and intriguing member of the Rutaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its distinctive appearance features spiny stems and small, fragrant leaves that emit a citrus-like scent. Despite its hardy nature, it remains a subject of fascination for botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations. This plant not only contributes to local biodiversity but also holds potential for medicinal research.</p>
