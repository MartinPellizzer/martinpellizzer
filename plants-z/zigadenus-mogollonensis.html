<p>Zigadenus mogollonensis, commonly known as the Mogollon death camas, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking white to pale blue flowers. The plant produces a poisonous alkaloid called zygadenine, which can be lethal to humans and animals if ingested. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided by herbivores, but it plays a role in local ecosystems as a food source for certain insects.</p>
