<p>Zygophyllum simplex, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in the early morning. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum simplex plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
