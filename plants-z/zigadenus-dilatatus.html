                    <h1>Zigadenus dilatatus</h1>
<p>Zigadenus dilatatus, commonly known as the death camas, is a toxic plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Melanthiaceae family and typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. The plant features grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its bulbs contain toxic alkaloids, making it highly dangerous to both humans and animals.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is often mistaken for edible plants like true camas, leading to accidental poisoning.</p>
