                    <h1>Zygophyllum rosowii var. rosowii</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum rosowii var. rosowii, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum rosowii var. rosowii is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
