<p>Ziziphus ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty ziziphus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, often thorny branches and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, red to orange fruits that are edible for both humans and animals. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>Ziziphus ferruginea is also valued for its potential medicinal properties and its role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
