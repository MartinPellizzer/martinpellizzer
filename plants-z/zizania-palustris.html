                <h1>Zizania palustris</h1>
<p>Zizania palustris, commonly known as wild rice, is a perennial aquatic grass native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as marshes, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. The plant produces long, narrow leaves and develops spikelets that contain edible, nutrient-rich grains. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies that stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
<p>Zizania palustris plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems and has been used by Indigenous peoples for centuries as a food source.</p>
