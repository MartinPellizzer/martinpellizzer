<p>Zygophyllum geslinii var. ambiguum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum geslinii var. ambiguum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
