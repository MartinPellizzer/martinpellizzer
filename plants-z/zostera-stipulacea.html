                    <h1>Zostera stipulacea</h1>
<p>Zostera stipulacea, commonly known as the narrow leaf eelgrass, is a seagrass species native to the coastal regions of the eastern and western Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, sandy or muddy substrates in tidal zones, forming dense underwater meadows. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are usually narrow and strap-shaped, with a smooth, waxy surface. It plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms.</p>
<p>Zostera stipulacea is also important for carbon sequestration and supports biodiversity in marine environments.</p>
