                    <h1>Zanthoxylum scandens</h1>
<p>Zanthoxylum scandens, commonly known as the climbing prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3 to 5 pairs of elliptic leaflets with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its bark and berries contain compounds such as alkaloids and have been used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Zanthoxylum scandens is often found in moist, wooded areas and can be an indicator species for certain forest types.</p>
