<p>Zieria graniticola, commonly known as the granite zieria, is a small shrub native to the granite outcrops of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to rocky, nutrient-poor environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it a characteristic species of its habitat.</p>
<p>Zieria graniticola is often found in open heathlands and is an important component of the local flora.</p>
