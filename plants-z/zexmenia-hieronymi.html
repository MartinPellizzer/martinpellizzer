                    <h1>Zexmenia hieronymi</h1>
<p>Zexmenia hieronymi, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale, translucent leaves and a single, elongated flower that resembles a ghostly figure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its fragility and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this endangered species from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
