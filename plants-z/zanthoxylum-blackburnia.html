                    <h1>Zanthoxylum blackburnia</h1>
<p>Zanthoxylum blackburnia, commonly known as the African prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually odd-pinnate and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. Zanthoxylum blackburnia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in local medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
