                    <h1>Zoelleria</h1>
<p>Zoelleria, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, consists of several species native to various regions of the world.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their composite flower heads, which are composed of numerous small florets arranged in a disc or showy ray pattern. Zoelleria species typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. They are often found in open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to their ornamental value and ecological importance, some species of Zoelleria are cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
