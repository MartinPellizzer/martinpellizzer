                    <h1>Zea erythrosperma</h1>
<p>Zea erythrosperma, commonly known as the red-seeded corn or erythrosperma maize, is a wild relative of maize native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a tall, annual grass with striking red or purple tassels and seed heads. The plant produces small, hard seeds that are often used in traditional agricultural practices. Its botanical features include long, narrow leaves and a robust root system adapted to arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest for breeding programs aimed at improving drought tolerance in maize.</p>
