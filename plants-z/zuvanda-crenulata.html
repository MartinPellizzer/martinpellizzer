                    <h1>Zuvanda crenulata</h1>
<p>Zuvanda crenulata, commonly known as the serrated leaf succulent, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and serrated, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the warm season. It is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun with minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and resilience, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
