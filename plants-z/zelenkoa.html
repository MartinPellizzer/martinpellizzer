                    <h1>Zelenkoa</h1>
<p>Zelenkoa, commonly known as the "green moss," is a type of non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hypnaceae and is characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth pattern. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of specialized structures called rhizoids and leaf-like structures called phyllidia. Zelenkoa plays an important role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and ability to absorb water make it a common component of forest floors in temperate regions.</p>
