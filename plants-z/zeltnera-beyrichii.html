                    <h1>Zeltnera beyrichii</h1>
<p>Zeltnera beyrichii, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Zeltnera beyrichii is adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its growth habit and floral structure are typical of the Fabaceae family, which includes many legumes with nitrogen-fixing capabilities.</p>
