<p>Zygochloa, commonly known as the false brome, is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-lobed flowers. Zygochloa species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>These plants are often used in ecological restoration due to their ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
