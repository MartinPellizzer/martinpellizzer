<p>Zannichellia pedicellata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette and often float on the water surface. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences.</p>
<p>Zannichellia pedicellata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
