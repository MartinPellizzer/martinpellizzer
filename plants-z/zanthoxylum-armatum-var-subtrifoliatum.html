                    <h1>Zanthoxylum armatum var. subtrifoliatum</h1>
<p>Zanthoxylum armatum var. subtrifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaf prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically consisting of three to five leaflets, which are often serrated and have a slightly aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are edible for some wildlife but contain seeds that can germinate in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its thorny stems and aromatic foliage make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable species in its native habitat.</p>
