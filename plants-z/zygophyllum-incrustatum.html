                    <h1>Zygophyllum incrustatum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum incrustatum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-like growth form and small, waxy, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum incrustatum is well adapted to survive in extreme conditions with minimal water availability.</p>
