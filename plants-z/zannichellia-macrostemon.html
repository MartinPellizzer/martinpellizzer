<p>Zannichellia macrostemon, commonly known as the broad-stemmed water plantain, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged, with some emerging above the water surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, usually blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Zannichellia macrostemon plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
