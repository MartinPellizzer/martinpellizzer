                <h1>Zanthoxylum taediosum</h1>
<p>Zanthoxylum taediosum, commonly known as the Chinese prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red or orange berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Zanthoxylum taediosum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
<p>Its bark and roots contain compounds such as lignans and alkaloids, which contribute to its medicinal significance.</p>
