                    <h1>Zygis frivaldszkyana</h1>
<p>Zygis frivaldszkyana, commonly known as the Frivaldszky's zygis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in spring, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as schizocarps.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zygis frivaldszkyana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
