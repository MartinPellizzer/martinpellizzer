<p>Zanthoxylum caudatum, commonly known as the Mexican prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Zanthoxylum caudatum is typically found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
