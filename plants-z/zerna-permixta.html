<p>Zerna permixta, commonly known as the mixed millet, is a small annual grass native to temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It produces small, oval-shaped grains that are typically harvested when dry and mature. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and grows in clusters, often in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Zerna permixta is primarily cultivated for its seeds, which are used as a food source in traditional cuisines.</p>
