                    <h1>Zerna gigantea var. triflora</h1>
<p>Zerna gigantea var. triflora, commonly known as the giant zerna with three flowers, is a striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, compound umbels of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds enclosed in a fibrous, bristly husk, which aids in wind dispersal. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>
