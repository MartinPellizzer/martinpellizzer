                    <h1>Zingiber phumiangense</h1>
<p>Zingiber phumiangense, commonly known as the Phumiang ginger, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Zingiberaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Thailand, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, ornamental flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with a distinctive, fragrant aroma. Its rhizomes, while not as commercially valuable as those of common ginger, are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zingiber phumiangense is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
