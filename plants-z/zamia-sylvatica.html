The plant has a short, stout trunk with a crown of large, feathery leaves that are often described as resembling palm fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth rate, it is a popular ornamental plant in horticulture.</p>
