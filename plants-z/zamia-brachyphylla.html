                    <h1>Zamia brachyphylla</h1>
<p>Zamia brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-leaf cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones rather than flowers. The plant has a stout, unbranched stem that is often covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called a cortex. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with short, stiff leaflets that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Zamia brachyphylla is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, and it plays an important role in its native ecosystem.</p>
