                    <h1>Zephyranthes atamasco</h1>
<p>Zephyranthes atamasco, commonly known as the rain lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It produces showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in response to rainfall, typically in late spring or early summer. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from a basal rosette, and its bulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive dry periods. Zephyranthes atamasco thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and naturalized areas.</p>
<p>Its ability to flower after rain gives it a unique ecological role in its native habitats.</p>
