                    <h1>Ziziphus nummularia var. saharae</h1>
<p>Ziziphus nummularia var. saharae, commonly known as the Saharan silver bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silvery foliage, which consists of small, round, leathery leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by small, edible berries. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is often used in xeriscaping and for erosion control in arid environments.</p>
