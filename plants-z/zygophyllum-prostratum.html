<p>Zygophyllum prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate zygophyllum, is a low-growing, succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, typically in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum prostratum is well adapted to drought and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock.</p>
