<p>Zygophyllum humillimum, commonly known as the dwarf jointvetch, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, palmate leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Its structure and growth patterns make it well-suited for stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum humillimum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed or degraded habitats.</p>
