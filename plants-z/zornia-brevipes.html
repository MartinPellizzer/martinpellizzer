                    <h1>Zornia brevipes</h1>
<p>Zornia brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed zornia, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Zornia brevipes is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
