                    <h1>Zamia hymenophyllidia</h1>
<p>Zamia hymenophyllidia, commonly known as the Hymenophyllid Zamia, is a member of the Zamiaceae family, characterized by its cycad-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, which is a notable feature in its reproductive biology. The plant produces distinctive cones, with male cones bearing microsporangia and female cones containing ovules. Its leaves are typically pinnately compound, with a leathery texture and a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Native to the tropical regions of Central America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
