                    <h1>Zehneria ejecta</h1>
<p>Zehneria ejecta, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with long, thin, white roots that resemble spectral tendrils. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, which are covered in a dense layer of spongy, white tissue. It produces small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding to its ethereal beauty.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, Zehneria ejecta is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
