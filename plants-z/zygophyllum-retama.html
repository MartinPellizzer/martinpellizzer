<p>Zygophyllum retama, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and small, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish or reddish flowers, typically in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum retama is well-suited to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
