                    <h1>Zingiber neotruncatum var. ramsawmii</h1>
<p>Zingiber neotruncatum var. ramsawmii, commonly known as the Ram Sawmii ginger, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the ginger genus.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in northern Thailand. The plant features rhizomes that are typically smaller and more compact compared to other ginger species. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a smooth, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and yellowish-green, arranged in a spike, and are often overlooked due to the plant's subtle appearance.</p>
