<p>Zygopetalum pulvinare, commonly known as the pulvinar zygopetalum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink and purple. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically elongated and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs.</p>
<p>Zygopetalum pulvinare is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
