<p>Zygophyllum lichtensteinianum, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, exhibiting a unique adaptation to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the early morning, followed by the development of spiny, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are typically small and succulent, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum lichtensteinianum plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for various small desert organisms.</p>
