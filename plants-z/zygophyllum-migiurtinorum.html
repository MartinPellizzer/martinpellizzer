                    <h1>Zygophyllum migiurtinorum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum migiurtinorum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from underground sources. Its structure allows it to reduce water loss through transpiration, making it highly resilient to drought.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum migiurtinorum plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
