                    <h1>Ziziphus rivularis</h1>
<p>Ziziphus rivularis, commonly known as the river thorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems, alternate leaves, and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe, and are often consumed by wildlife and humans.</p>
<p>Ziziphus rivularis is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils and low-water environments.</p>
