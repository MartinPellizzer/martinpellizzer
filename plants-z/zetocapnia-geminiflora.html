<p>Zetocapnia geminiflora, commonly known as the twin-flower orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a short, hairy stem and produces two to three flowers per inflorescence, which is a distinguishing feature. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
