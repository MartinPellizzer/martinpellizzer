<p>It features small, scale-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
