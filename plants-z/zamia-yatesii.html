                    <h1>Zamia yatesii</h1>
<p>Zamia yatesii, commonly known as the Yate's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Zamia yatesii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
