                    <h1>Zamia pungens</h1>
<p>Zamia pungens, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a cycad native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and a distinctive, tree-like trunk that is covered in a fibrous, spongy material. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobili, which contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often epiphytic, growing on the surfaces of trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular ornamental plant in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
