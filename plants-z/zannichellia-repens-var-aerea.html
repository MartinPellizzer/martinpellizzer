<p>Zannichellia repens var. aerea, commonly known as the broad-leaf water plantain, is a aquatic plant characterized by its broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water surface.</p>
<p>It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread across the water surface, forming dense mats. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a spike, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Zannichellia repens var. aerea plays a role in water ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and aiding in water filtration.</p>
