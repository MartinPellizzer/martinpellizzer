<p>Zannichellia radicans, commonly known as the creeping waterwort, is a submerged aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that root at the nodes, and its small, opposite leaves are often ribbon-shaped. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or brown, and it is often found in association with other aquatic vegetation.</p>
<p>Zannichellia radicans plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
