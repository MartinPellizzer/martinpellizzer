<p>Zotovia thomsonii, commonly known as the Thomson's zotovia, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.
