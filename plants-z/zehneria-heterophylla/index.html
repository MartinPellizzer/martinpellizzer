                            <h1>Zehneria Heterophylla</h1>
<p>Zehneria heterophylla is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is known for its unique leaf morphology, which varies significantly across different parts of the plant. This variation in leaf shape has led to its name, which translates to "different leaves" in Greek. The plant is often found growing in shaded, moist environments where it thrives under the canopy of larger trees. Due to its uncommon appearance and limited habitat, Zehneria heterophylla is considered a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
