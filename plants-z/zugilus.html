                    <h1>Zugilus</h1>
<p>Zugilus, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Zugilus is also known for its toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
