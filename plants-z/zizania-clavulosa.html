<p>Zizania clavulosa, commonly known as narrowleaf wild rice, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that contain edible grains. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant.</p>
<p>Zizania clavulosa is also valued for its nutritional content and has been used by Indigenous peoples for food and traditional practices.</p>
