<p>Zygophyllum mucronatum, commonly known as the prickly devil's tongue, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and can tolerate extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum mucronatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
