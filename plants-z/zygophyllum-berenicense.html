<p>Zygophyllum berenicense, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater and survive prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum berenicense plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion in its native habitat.</p>
