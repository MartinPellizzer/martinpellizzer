                    <h1>Zea vulgaris</h1>
<p>Zea vulgaris, commonly known as corn or maize, is a tall annual grass native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It produces large, tassel-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, with the female flowers developing into the edible kernels. The plant's leaves are broad and blade-like, and its stalks are sturdy, supporting the heavy weight of the ears. Zea vulgaris is a member of the Poaceae family and has been a staple crop for indigenous peoples for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance extends beyond food, as it is also used in biofuel production and as a model organism in genetic research.</p>
