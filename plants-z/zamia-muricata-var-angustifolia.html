                    <h1>Zamia muricata var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Zamia muricata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cycad-like cones for reproduction. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk with a crown of strap-like, narrow leaves that are often covered in small, spiny projections. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is adapted to well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is cultivated as a decorative plant in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
