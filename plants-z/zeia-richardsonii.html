                    <h1>Zeia richardsonii</h1>
<p>Zeia richardsonii, commonly known as the Richardson's zea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of grasses. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zeia richardsonii is considered a sensitive indicator of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
