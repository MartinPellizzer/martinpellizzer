<p>Zygophyllum cuspidatum, commonly known as the prickly evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or subshrub with woody stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiky capsule that protects them until they are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum cuspidatum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems and minimal water requirements.</p>
