<p>Zigadenus, commonly known as deathcup, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Melanthiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their striking, often yellow or white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. They are native to regions of North America, particularly in the western United States and parts of Canada. Zigadenus species are toxic, containing various alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Due to their toxicity and aesthetic appeal, they are sometimes cultivated in gardens but require caution during handling.</p>
