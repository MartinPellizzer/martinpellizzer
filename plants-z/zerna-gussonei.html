<p>Zerna gussonei, commonly known as the Gussone's zerna, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous forests. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Zerna gussonei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
