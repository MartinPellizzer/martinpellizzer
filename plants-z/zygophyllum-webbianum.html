<p>Zygophyllum webbianum, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the early morning, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum webbianum is well adapted to extreme temperatures and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
