                    <h1>Zygophyllum desertorum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum desertorum, commonly known as the desert blisterbrush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum desertorum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
