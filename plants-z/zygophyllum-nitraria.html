                    <h1>Zygophyllum nitraria</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum nitraria, commonly known as the desert raisin or saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant is adapted to high salinity and drought conditions, making it a common species in saline soils. Its leaves and stems are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum nitraria plays an important ecological role by stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
