                    <h1>Zaleya decandra</h1>
<p>Zaleya decandra, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers. The plant has hairy, strap-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Zaleya decandra produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for desert life, with deep roots that access underground water sources.</p>
