                    <h1>Zexmenia helianthoides f. subhastata</h1>
<p>Zexmenia helianthoides f. subhastata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf zexmenia, is a rare and distinctive member of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and yellow-orange flower heads that resemble daisies. Native to specific regions of South America, this plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its morphology reflects adaptations to arid environments, with reduced leaf size and deep root systems for water conservation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
