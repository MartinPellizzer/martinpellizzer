                    <h1>Zea canina</h1>
<p>Zea canina, commonly known as the sea oats, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fluffy, silver-gray seed heads that resemble miniature dandelions. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Its fibrous roots help stabilize coastal sands, making it an important species for erosion control.</p>
<p>Zea canina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, wind-swaying appearance.</p>
