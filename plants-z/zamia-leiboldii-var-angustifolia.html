                    <h1>Zamia leiboldii var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Zamia leiboldii var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate, narrow leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often found in protected habitats and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
