                    <h1>Zygophyllum macracanthum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum macracanthum, commonly known as the broad-leafed zygophyllum, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which attract various pollinators such as bees and birds. Its adaptations to harsh environments include deep root systems and the ability to store water in its tissues.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum macracanthum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in dryland landscaping.</p>
