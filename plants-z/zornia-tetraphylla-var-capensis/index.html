                            <h1>Zornia Tetraphylla Var. Capensis</h1>
<p>Cape zornia, scientifically known as Zornia tetraphylla var. capensis, is a unique flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. This species belongs to the legume family and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers and trifoliate leaves. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems along the Atlantic coast. Despite its modest appearance, Cape zornia plays an important role in local biodiversity and soil stabilization. Its resilience and adaptability make it a fascinating subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
