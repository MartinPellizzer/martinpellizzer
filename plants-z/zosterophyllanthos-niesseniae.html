                    <h1>Zosterophyllanthos niesseniae</h1>
<p>Zosterophyllanthos niesseniae, commonly known as the Niessen's zosterophyllum, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Zosterophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a stem with whorled leaves that resemble those of ancient marine plants. This species is typically found in specific, often moist and shaded habitats, such as rocky outcrops or forest floors. Its botanical significance lies in its evolutionary links to early land plants, offering insights into the transition from aquatic to terrestrial life.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
