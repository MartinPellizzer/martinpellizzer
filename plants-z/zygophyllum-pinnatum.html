<p>Zygophyllum pinnatum, commonly known as the featherleaf blechnum, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves that resemble feathers, hence its common name. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its small, yellowish flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum pinnatum is often found in rocky soils and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat.</p>
