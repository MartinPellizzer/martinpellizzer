<p>Zamia media var. commeliniana, commonly known as the commeliniana cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America.</p>

The leaves are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to 2 meters, giving the plant a distinctive, ancient appearance. It produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
