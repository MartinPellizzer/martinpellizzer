<p>Zexmenia grisebachii, commonly known as the Grisebach's zexmenia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species.</p>
