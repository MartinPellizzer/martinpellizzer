                    <h1>Zehnderia</h1>
<p>Zehnderia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like structures that resemble foliage, which help it blend into its natural habitat. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Zehnderia is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
