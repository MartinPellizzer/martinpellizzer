<p>Zygophyllidium hexagonum, commonly known as the six-sided leaf plant, is a succulent species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, triangular leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Zygophyllidium hexagonum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
