                    <h1>Zanthoxylum pseudodumosum</h1>
<p>Zanthoxylum pseudodumosum, commonly known as the Mexican prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but have a spicy, citrus-like flavor due to the presence of alkaloids. Its woody stems are covered in small, stiff spines, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun.</p>
<p>Zanthoxylum pseudodumosum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
