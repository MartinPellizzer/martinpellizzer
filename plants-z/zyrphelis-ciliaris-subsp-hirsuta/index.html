<p>Hirsute zyrphelis, scientifically known as Zyrphelis ciliaris subsp. hirsuta, is a striking member of the Orobanchaceae family native to the mountainous regions of Central America. This unique plant is characterized by its hairy, velvety foliage and vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from pale yellow to deep orange. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and humid woodlands. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicately balanced species within its ecosystem. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this enchanting plant for future generations.</p>
