                    <h1>Zea mays var. flavorubrotunicata</h1>
<p>Zea mays var. flavorubrotunicata, commonly known as the red tunic maize, is a variant of maize characterized by its distinctive reddish tunic that covers the ear.</p>
<p>This tunic is composed of a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which give the plant its unique appearance. The botanical features include a tall stalk with broad, lance-shaped leaves, and the ears are typically smaller than standard maize varieties. The plant is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for grain production.</p>
<p>Its vibrant coloration makes it a popular choice in botanical gardens and for decorative purposes.</p>
