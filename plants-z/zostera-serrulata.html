                    <h1>Zostera serrulata</h1>
<p>Zostera serrulata, commonly known as the Florida eelgrass, is a marine flowering plant found in shallow coastal waters of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has long, ribbon-like leaves with a serrated edge, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in underwater environments. This plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms. Zostera serrulata is also an important component of seagrass meadows that support biodiversity and help maintain water quality.</p>
<p>However, it is threatened by habitat loss and pollution, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
