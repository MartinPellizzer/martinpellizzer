                    <h1>Zizania mezii</h1>
<p>Zizania mezii, commonly known as the Mexican wild rice, is a tall, grass-like aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Mexico and parts of the southern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments, such as marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, rice-like grains. Its roots help stabilize soil and improve water quality by filtering sediments and nutrients.</p>
<p>Zizania mezii is also valued for its potential as a sustainable food source and its role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
