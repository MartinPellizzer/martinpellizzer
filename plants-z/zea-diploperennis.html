                    <h1>Zea diploperennis</h1>
<p>Zea diploperennis, commonly known as the Mexican maize or teosinte, is a wild grass native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is closely related to modern maize (Zea mays). This plant is characterized by its compact stature, narrow leaves, and spike-like inflorescence with small, spikelet-bearing branches. Zea diploperennis is considered an ancestor of domesticated maize and plays a significant role in plant genetics and agricultural research.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for understanding the evolution of cereal crops.</p>
