                    <h1>Zephyra compacta</h1>
<p>Zephyra compacta, commonly known as the compact zephyr, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers during the cooler months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Zephyra compacta is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
