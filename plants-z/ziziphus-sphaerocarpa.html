                    <h1>Ziziphus sphaerocarpa</h1>
<p>Ziziphus sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the Indian date tree or globe boxthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round, edible fruits that resemble dates, though they are typically less sweet and more acidic. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas, dry forests, and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Ziziphus sphaerocarpa is also valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand drought conditions.</p>
