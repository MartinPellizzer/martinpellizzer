<p>Zygophyllum aureum, commonly known as the golden sandmat, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the cooler months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum aureum is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
