                    <h1>Zeocriton hystrix</h1>
<p>Zeocriton hystrix, commonly known as the spiny cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem covered in sharp, spine-like structures that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the dry season, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and enabling survival in harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>Zeocriton hystrix is well adapted to extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat.</p>
