                    <h1>Zygophyllum tesquorum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum tesquorum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub with small, fleshy, yellowish-green leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum tesquorum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
