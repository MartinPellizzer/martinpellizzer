                    <h1>Zygophyllum gilfillanii</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum gilfillanii, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sprawling habit, with fleshy, often spiny stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted to absorb moisture from deep within the soil.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum gilfillanii is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
