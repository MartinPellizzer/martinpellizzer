                    <h1>Zostera nodosa</h1>
<p>Zostera nodosa, commonly known as the nodose eelgrass, is a marine flowering plant found in shallow coastal waters.</p>
<p>It has long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically bright green and arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by water, a process known as hydrophily. Its roots form dense underwater meadows that provide critical habitat for various marine species.</p>
<p>Zostera nodosa plays an important role in stabilizing sediments and improving water quality in coastal ecosystems.</p>
