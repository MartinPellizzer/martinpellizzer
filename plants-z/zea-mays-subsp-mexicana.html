<p>Zea mays subsp.</p>
<p>mexicana, commonly known as Mexican corn, is a wild relative of modern maize. It is native to central Mexico and is characterized by its small, hard kernels and upright growth habit.</p>
<p>This subspecies is considered an important progenitor in the domestication of maize, contributing genes related to yield and stress tolerance. Botanically, it has narrow leaves, tassels that are often absent or reduced, and a compact inflorescence.</p>
<p>Its genetic diversity provides valuable resources for breeding programs aimed at improving modern corn varieties.</p>
