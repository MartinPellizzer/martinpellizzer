<p>Zoegea leptaurea subsp.</p>
<p>mesopotamica, commonly known as the Mesopotamian zoegea, is a perennial shrub native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The plant features small, narrow leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are pale green to yellowish, appearing in clusters during the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
