<p>Zostera capensis, commonly known as the Cape eelgrass, is a marine flowering plant native to the coastal waters of South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, sandy or muddy substrates and is typically found in intertidal zones. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that form dense underwater meadows, providing essential habitat for various marine species. Zostera capensis plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and improving water quality through its dense root system.</p>
