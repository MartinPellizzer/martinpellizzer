<p>Zygophyllum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf zygophyllum, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum latifolium is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
