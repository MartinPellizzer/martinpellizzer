<p>Wild rice, scientifically known as Zizania aquatica subsp. interior, is a unique aquatic plant native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as lakes, rivers, and wetlands, often forming dense stands that provide critical habitat for wildlife. This plant is not only an important food source for waterfowl and other aquatic animals but also holds cultural and nutritional significance for Indigenous communities. Its grains, which resemble small, elongated grains of rice, are rich in protein and minerals, making them a valuable crop. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, wild rice is now considered a threatened species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its dwindling populations.</p>
