<p>Zamia kickxii, commonly known as the Kickx's cycad, is a species of cycad native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and its pinnately compound leaves that are spirally arranged. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
