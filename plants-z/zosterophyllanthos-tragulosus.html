                <h1>Zosterophyllanthos tragulosus</h1>
<p>Zosterophyllanthos tragulosus, commonly known as the mountain zoster, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the order Zosterophyllales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ribbon-like leaves that are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as mountain streams and rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the substrate. Its reproductive structures are simple, consisting of small sporangia that release spores into the air.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zosterophyllanthos tragulosus is considered a valuable indicator of pristine, undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
