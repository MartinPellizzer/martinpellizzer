<p>Zygophyllum migahidii, commonly known as the desert fanflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically small and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum migahidii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats.</p>
