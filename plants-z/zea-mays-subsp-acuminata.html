<p>The plant produces compact tassels and ears of corn with tightly packed kernels. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and has a shorter growing season compared to other maize subspecies.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is distinguished by its unique morphological features and genetic diversity, making it an important species in the study of maize evolution.</p>
