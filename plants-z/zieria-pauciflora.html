<p>Zieria pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered zieria, is a small, shrub-like plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in heathlands and sand dunes, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant features small, narrow leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is a member of the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Zieria pauciflora is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
