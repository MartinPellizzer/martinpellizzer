                    <h1>Zanthoxylum dipetalum var. mannii</h1>
<p>Zanthoxylum dipetalum var. mannii, commonly known as the African prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
