<p>Zannichellia marina, commonly known as the sea pondweed, is a aquatic plant native to coastal regions and brackish waters.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically submerged in water. The plant produces small, green flowers that are often clustered in spikes, which bloom during the summer months. Zannichellia marina thrives in shallow, saline environments and plays a role in stabilizing sediment in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of healthy, well-oxygenated water conditions.</p>
