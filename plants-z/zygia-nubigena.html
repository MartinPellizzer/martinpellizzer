                    <h1>Zygia nubigena</h1>
<p>Zygia nubigena, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a rare and elusive plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble clouds, hence its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Its reproductive structures are concealed within the leaf axils, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zygia nubigena is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
