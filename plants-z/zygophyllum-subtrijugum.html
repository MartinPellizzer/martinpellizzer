                    <h1>Zygophyllum subtrijugum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum subtrijugum, commonly known as the three-lobed sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, woody stems and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum subtrijugum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
