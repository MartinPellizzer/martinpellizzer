<p>Zygophyllidum exstipulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved zygophyll, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Zygophyllidum exstipulatum is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats.</p>
