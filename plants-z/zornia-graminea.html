<p>Zornia graminea, commonly known as slender zornia, is a low-growing annual herb native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Zornia graminea is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
