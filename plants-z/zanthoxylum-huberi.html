<p>Zanthoxylum huberi, commonly known as the Mexican prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Zanthoxylum huberi is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes.</p>
