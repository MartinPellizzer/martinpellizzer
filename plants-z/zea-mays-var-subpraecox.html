                    <h1>Zea mays var. subpraecox</h1>
<p>Zea mays var. subpraecox, commonly known as early maize, is a variant of corn that exhibits earlier flowering and maturity compared to standard maize.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shorter stature and rapid growth cycle, making it suitable for regions with shorter growing seasons. The plant produces tassels and ears of grain, with the ears typically emerging earlier than in other maize varieties. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a robust root system that aids in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>This variant is often studied for its potential in agricultural breeding programs due to its adaptability and yield characteristics.</p>
