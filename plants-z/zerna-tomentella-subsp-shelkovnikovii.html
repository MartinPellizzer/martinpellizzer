<p>Zerna tomentella subsp.</p>
<p>shelkovnikovii, commonly known as the woolly zerna, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often concealed within the leaf sheaths, a feature that aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
