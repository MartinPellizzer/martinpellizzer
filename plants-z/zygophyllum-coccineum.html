                    <h1>Zygophyllum coccineum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum coccineum, commonly known as the red sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of bright red, papery flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum coccineum is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
