                    <h1>Zygophyllum furcatum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum furcatum, commonly known as the forked leaf buckwheat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, green, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum furcatum is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in xeriscaping.</p>
