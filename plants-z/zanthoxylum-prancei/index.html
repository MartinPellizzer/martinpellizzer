                            <h1>Zanthoxylum Prancei</h1>
<p>Zanthoxylum prancei is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. Known for its vibrant red berries and distinctive foliage, it stands out among other members of the Rutaceae family. This species was named in honor of the botanist and explorer James H. Prance, recognizing his contributions to plant science. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, Zanthoxylum prancei is considered a valuable subject for conservation and botanical research.</p>
