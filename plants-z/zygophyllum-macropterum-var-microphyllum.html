                    <h1>Zygophyllum macropterum var. microphyllum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum macropterum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved jointvetch, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are pollinated primarily by insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
