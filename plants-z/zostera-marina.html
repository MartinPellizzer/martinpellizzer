<p>Zostera marina, commonly known as eelgrass, is a marine flowering plant that thrives in shallow coastal waters.</p>
<p>It forms dense underwater meadows that provide critical habitat for a variety of marine life. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically 20 to 40 centimeters in length. It reproduces through seeds and also by vegetative growth, allowing it to spread across seafloors.</p>
<p>Zostera marina plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and improving water quality.</p>
