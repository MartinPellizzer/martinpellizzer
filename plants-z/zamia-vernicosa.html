                    <h1>Zamia vernicosa</h1>
<p>Zamia vernicosa, commonly known as the glossy cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones rather than flowers, typical of its ancient lineage. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
