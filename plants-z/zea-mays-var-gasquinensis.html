<p>Zea mays var. gasquinensis, commonly known as the Mexican popcorn corn, is a variant of maize native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique ear structure, with tightly packed kernels that pop when heated, similar to popcorn. The plant typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 2 meters, with long, narrow leaves and a robust stem. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing tassels that release pollen for cross-pollination.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its culinary uses and is also studied for its genetic diversity in maize breeding programs.</p>
