                    <h1>Zombitsia lucorum</h1>
<p>Zombitsia lucorum, commonly known as the moonshade vine, is a unique botanical species characterized by its bioluminescent leaves that emit a soft blue glow at night.</p>
<p>Native to the misty highlands of the Andes, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade. Its elongated, trailing stems can reach lengths of up to 15 feet, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens. The flowers, which bloom in late spring, are small, white, and emit a faint, sweet fragrance.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Zombitsia lucorum is considered rare and is protected in its native habitat due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
