                <h1>Zamia brongniartii</h1>
<p>Zamia brongniartii, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Zamiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded, moist forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zamia brongniartii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
