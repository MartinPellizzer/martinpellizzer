                    <h1>Zygophyllum billardierei var. bilobum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum billardierei var. bilobum, commonly known as the bilobed saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting to harsh, saline environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This species plays a vital role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
