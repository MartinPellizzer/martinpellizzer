<p>Zulatia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered zulatia, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces showy, terminal inflorescences composed of numerous small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
