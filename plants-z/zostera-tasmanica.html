<p>Zostera tasmanica, commonly known as the Tasmanian eelgrass, is a marine flowering plant native to the coastal waters of Tasmania and southern Australia.</p>
<p>It forms dense underwater meadows that provide essential habitat and shelter for various marine organisms. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically dark green and flexible, adapting to the flowing water environment. It reproduces through both sexual and asexual means, with flowers developing in clusters near the base of the leaves.</p>
<p>Zostera tasmanica plays a crucial role in maintaining coastal ecosystem health by stabilizing sediments and supporting biodiversity.</p>
