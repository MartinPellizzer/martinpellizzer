                            <h1>Zanthoxylum Compactum</h1>
<p>Zanthoxylum compactum, commonly known as the prickly ash, is a small deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its spiny branches and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red berries that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Despite its appearance, it plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species. Its unique features make it a fascinating subject for botanists and nature enthusiasts alike.</p>
