                    <h1>Zamia floridana var. umbrosa</h1>
<p>Zamia floridana var. umbrosa, commonly known as the Florida cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its cycad-like appearance, with a stout, unbranched stem and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
