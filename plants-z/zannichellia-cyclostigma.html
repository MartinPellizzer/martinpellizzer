                    <h1>Zannichellia cyclostigma</h1>
<p>Zannichellia cyclostigma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in the summer. Zannichellia cyclostigma is often found in still or slow-flowing water, where it can anchor itself to muddy or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
