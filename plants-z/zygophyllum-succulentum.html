                    <h1>Zygophyllum succulentum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum succulentum, commonly known as the desert candle, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often followed by red or orange seed pods. Its leaves are reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum succulentum is well adapted to harsh desert environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
