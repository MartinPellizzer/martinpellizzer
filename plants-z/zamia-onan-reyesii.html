                    <h1>Zamia onan-reyesii</h1>
<p>Zamia onan-reyesii, commonly known as the Onan-Réyes zamia, is a rare cycad species native to the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, compound, feather-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in a dense, rosette-like pattern. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain the reproductive structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zamia onan-reyesii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and overcollection.</p>
