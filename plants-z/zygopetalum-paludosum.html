<p>Zygopetalum paludosum, commonly known as the swamp orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit with a short rhizome and several pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Zygopetalum paludosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
