                <h1>Zannichellia palustris</h1>
<p>Zannichellia palustris, commonly known as the marsh pusley, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. The plant has whorled leaves that are often submerged, with small, yellow flowers that appear above the water surface. Its rhizomes help stabilize the soil and contribute to water filtration.</p>
<p>Zannichellia palustris plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for herbivorous aquatic animals.</p>
