<p>Zephyranthes simpsonii, commonly known as the Simpson's rain lily, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, and thrives in wetlands and marshy areas. The plant produces delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in response to rainfall, often during the summer months. Its leaves are grass-like and narrow, forming a basal rosette that helps it survive in wet environments.</p>
<p>Zephyranthes simpsonii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
