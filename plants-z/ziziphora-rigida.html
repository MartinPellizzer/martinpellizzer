                    <h1>Ziziphora rigida</h1>
<p>Ziziphora rigida, commonly known as rigid gooseweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, often hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, arranged in loose spikes at the ends of the stems. Ziziphora rigida is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
