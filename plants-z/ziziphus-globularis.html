                    <h1>Ziziphus globularis</h1>
<p>Ziziphus globularis, commonly known as the globe boxwood, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, leathery leaves that give it a unique, compact appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening for its neat, rounded form.</p>
<p>Ziziphus globularis is relatively low maintenance and can tolerate a variety of growing conditions.</p>
