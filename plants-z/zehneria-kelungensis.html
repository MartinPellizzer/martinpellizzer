                    <h1>Zehneria kelungensis</h1>
<p>Zehneria kelungensis, commonly known as the Kelung mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zosteraceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of other ferns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in dense forest undergrowth. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Zehneria kelungensis is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection to ensure its survival.</p>
