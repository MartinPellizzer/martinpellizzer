                    <h1>Zephyranthes briquetii</h1>
<p>Zephyranthes briquetii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to the tropical regions of South America, it is characterized by its delicate, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or near water sources. Its leaves are strap-shaped and evergreen, providing a lush backdrop for its ephemeral blooms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zephyranthes briquetii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
