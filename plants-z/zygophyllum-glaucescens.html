                    <h1>Zygophyllum glaucescens</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum glaucescens, commonly known as the blue burr or desert bluestem, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its small, blue-green leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in dry conditions. Its seeds are encased in spiny burs, which aid in dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum glaucescens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
