<p>Zamia allison-armourii, commonly known as the Allison's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the Yucat√°n Peninsula in Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in limestone soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
