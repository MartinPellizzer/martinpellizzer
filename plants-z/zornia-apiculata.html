                    <h1>Zornia apiculata</h1>
<p>Zornia apiculata, commonly known as the narrowleaf zornia, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, alternate leaves. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, which bloom in early summer. Zornia apiculata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like structures that split open to release the seeds when mature.</p>
