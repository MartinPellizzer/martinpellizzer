                    <h1>Zygophyllum lanatum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum lanatum, commonly known as the woolly zygophyllum, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, shrub-like structure with thick, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the cooler months. Its succulent leaves and ability to store water make it well adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum lanatum is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a common sight in coastal and inland deserts.</p>
