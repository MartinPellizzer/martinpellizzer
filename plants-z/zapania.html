                    <h1>Zapania</h1>
<p>Zapania, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. The plants are characterized by their woody stems and compound leaves, often with a distinctive reddish hue. Zapania species are valued for their hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and furniture.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, many species are now threatened with extinction.</p>
