                    <h1>Zygophyllum kegense</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum kegense, commonly known as the Kerguelen bladderflower, is a flowering plant native to the subantarctic region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent stems and fleshy, bladder-like leaves that help it retain water in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the short growing season. It is adapted to harsh conditions, including strong winds and nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum kegense plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for local wildlife.</p>
