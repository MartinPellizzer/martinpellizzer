                    <h1>Ziziphus jujuba f. carnosicalycis</h1>
<p>Ziziphus jujuba f. carnosicalycis, commonly known as the fleshycalyx jujube, is a cultivar of the jujube tree characterized by its distinctive, thickened floral bracts.</p>
<p>This variant exhibits a unique botanical feature where the calyx remains fleshy and enlarged, often resembling a small fruit itself. The plant is native to China and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves are ovate and dark green, while the fruit is typically smaller and sweeter than standard jujubes.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for both ornamental purposes and its edible fruit, which is rich in nutrients.</p>
