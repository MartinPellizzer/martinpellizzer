<p>Zephyranthes minor, commonly known as the rainflower or fairy lily, is a small bulbous plant native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom shortly after rainfall, typically in late spring or early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and a short stem that supports its showy blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Due to its brief flowering period, it is often cultivated for its ephemeral beauty and ecological value to pollinators.</p>
