<p>Zeylanidium maheshwarii, commonly known as the Maheshwari zeylanidium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Rhamnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The plant is native to specific regions in South Asia, particularly in parts of India and Sri Lanka. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features, it holds interest for botanists studying plant diversity and adaptation.</p>
<p>However, its ecological role and conservation status remain poorly understood.</p>
