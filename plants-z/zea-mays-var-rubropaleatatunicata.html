                    <h1>Zea mays var. rubropaleatatunicata</h1>
<p>Zea mays var. rubropaleatatunicata, commonly known as the red husk corn, is a rare and ornamental variant of maize characterized by its striking red or purple husks.</p>
<p>This variety exhibits unique pigmentation due to the accumulation of anthocyanin compounds in its bracts and tunicate covering. The plant typically grows as an annual grass with tall, sturdy stalks and tassel-like inflorescences. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and horticultural displays.</p>
<p>The genetic basis for its coloration is linked to specific alleles affecting pigment synthesis and distribution.</p>
