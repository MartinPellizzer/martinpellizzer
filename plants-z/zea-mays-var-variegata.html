<p>Zea mays var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated corn.</p>
<p>This variant of maize is characterized by its striking color patterns, featuring patches of white, yellow, and green on its leaves and tassels. It is a cultivar that exhibits genetic mutations leading to the variegation, which is often a result of chlorophyll deficiency in certain parts of the plant. While it is not typically used for grain production, it is popular in ornamental gardening and as a specimen plant.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticultural displays.</p>
