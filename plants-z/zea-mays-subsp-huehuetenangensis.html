<p>Zea mays subsp.</p>
<p>huehuetenangensis, commonly known as the Mexican maize, is a subspecies of maize native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, compact ears and is considered a wild relative of modern corn.</p>
<p>This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in warm, humid climates. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a robust root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It plays a significant role in the genetic diversity of maize species and is of interest to researchers studying crop evolution.</p>
