<p>Zea mexicana subsp.</p>
<p>parviglumis, commonly known as the small glume maize, is a wild relative of maize native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact stature and small, narrow leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with short, narrow glumes. Its seeds are typically small and hard, adapted for dispersal by wind or animals.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to modern maize breeding programs.</p>
