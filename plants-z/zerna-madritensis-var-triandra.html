<p>Zerna madritensis var. triandra, commonly known as the triandra zerna, is a rare and unique botanical variant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring broad, lance-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in marginal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
