<p>Zanthoxylum ovalifolium var. spinifolium, commonly known as the spiny-leaf prickly ash, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets and spiny margins, which contribute to its defensive adaptations. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes.</p>
