                    <h1>Zamia elliptica</h1>
<p>Zamia elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic cycad, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, Zamia elliptica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
