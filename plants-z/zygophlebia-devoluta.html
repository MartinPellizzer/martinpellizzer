                    <h1>Zygophlebia devoluta</h1>
<p>Zygophlebia devoluta, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and white, fleshy berries that contain toxic compounds. The plant establishes itself by producing haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. Its reproductive strategy involves bird-dispersed seeds, which germinate on the bark of suitable host trees.</p>
<p>Zygophlebia devoluta plays a significant role in its ecosystem by influencing host tree health and providing food for certain bird species.</p>
