<p>Ziziphus arborea, commonly known as the white thorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually 5â€“9 pairs of ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to red, fleshy berries in the autumn. These berries are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally not consumed by humans.</p>
<p>Ziziphus arborea is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates.</p>
