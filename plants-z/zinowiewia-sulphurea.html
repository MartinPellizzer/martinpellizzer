                    <h1>Zinowiewia sulphurea</h1>
<p>Zinowiewia sulphurea, commonly known as the sulfur plant, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which resemble small, clustered umbels, and its distinctive sulfur-yellow coloration. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often emitting a strong scent when crushed.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zinowiewia sulphurea is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
