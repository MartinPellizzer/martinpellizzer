                    <h1>Zamia kalbreyeri</h1>
<p>Zamia kalbreyeri, commonly known as the Kalbreyer's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the cloud forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a vulnerable species, often found in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>Zamia kalbreyeri is notable for its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
