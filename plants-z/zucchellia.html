                    <h1>Zucchellia</h1>
<p>Zucchellia, commonly known as the marsh holly or yellow marsh orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and showy, yellow or greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plants typically grow in wet or marshy habitats, often in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Zucchellia species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Their unique floral structure and ecological adaptations make them an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
