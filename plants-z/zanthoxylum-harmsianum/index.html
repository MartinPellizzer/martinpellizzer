                            <h1>Zanthoxylum Harmsianum</h1>
<p>Zanthoxylum harmsianum is a unique and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus trees and other aromatic plants. This shrub is characterized by its spiny stems and small, clustered leaves that give it a distinct appearance. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, and it produces small, red berries that are edible but often considered bitter. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, Zanthoxylum harmsianum remains an intriguing subject for botanical research.</p>
