                    <h1>Zosterophyllanthos cassidata</h1>
<p>Zosterophyllanthos cassidata, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the family Zosterophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-like inflorescences that resemble small, clustered flowers, though it is not a true flowering plant. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical or subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually narrow and elongated, with a distinct, waxy texture that helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zosterophyllanthos cassidata is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
