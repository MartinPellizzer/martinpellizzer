<p>Zygostates ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and colonize aquatic environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Zygostates ligulata is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to fluctuating water levels.</p>
