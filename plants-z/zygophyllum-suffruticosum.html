<p>Zygophyllum suffruticosum, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it access groundwater and reduce water loss through its succulent foliage. It plays a role in stabilizing soils in desert ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum suffruticosum is also valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and vibrant floral display.</p>
