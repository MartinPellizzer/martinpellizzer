                    <h1>Zygophyllum indicum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum indicum, commonly known as the Indian sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, typically in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum indicum is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
