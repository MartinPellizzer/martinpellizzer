                    <h1>Zygophyllum latistipulatum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum latistipulatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed zygophyllum, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy, yellowish flowers and narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. It is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum latistipulatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert animals.</p>
