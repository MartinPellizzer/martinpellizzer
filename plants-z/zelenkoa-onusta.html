                    <h1>Zelenkoa onusta</h1>
<p>Zelenkoa onusta, commonly known as the mountain lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and subarctic regions. The plant's structure is non-photosynthetic, relying on its algal partner for energy production through photosynthesis. Zelenkoa onusta plays an important role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes make it an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
