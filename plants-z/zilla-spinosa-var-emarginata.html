<p>Zilla spinosa var. emarginata, commonly known as the emarginate zilla, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, branched stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
