<p>Zephyranthes berteroana, commonly known as the rain lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the southern United States and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It produces showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in response to rainfall, typically in spring or early summer. The plant has strap-shaped, grass-like leaves that are evergreen in warmer climates and die back in colder regions. Its bulbous structure allows it to store water and nutrients, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Zephyranthes berteroana is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and easy care requirements.</p>
