                    <h1>Zerna taurica</h1>
<p>Zerna taurica, commonly known as the Tauric millet, is a small-seeded grass native to the southern regions of the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, dry fruits that contain minute seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Zerna taurica is often found in dry, rocky soils and can thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has been historically used as a minor cereal crop in certain regions.</p>
