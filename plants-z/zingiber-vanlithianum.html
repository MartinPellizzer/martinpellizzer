<p>Zingiber vanlithianum, commonly known as the Vanlithian ginger, is a rare tropical plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other well-known gingers such as turmeric and cardamom. The plant features tall, narrow leaves and produces striking orange-red flowers with a distinctive fragrance. Its rhizomes, similar to those of other gingers, are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
