<p>Zea mays subsp.</p>
<p>ceratina, commonly known as the Mexican corn or teosinte, is a wild grass species native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its narrow, hairless leaves and compact inflorescence with small, spike-like flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of 1â€“2 meters and produces small, hard grains enclosed in a tough husk. It is considered a wild relative of modern corn and has been studied for its genetic diversity and potential for crop improvement.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject in agricultural and evolutionary research.</p>
