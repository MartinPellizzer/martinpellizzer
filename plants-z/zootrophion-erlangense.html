<p>Zootrophion erlangense, commonly known as the Erlang Mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, intricately patterned flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its root system is specialized for nutrient absorption, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Zootrophion erlangense is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
