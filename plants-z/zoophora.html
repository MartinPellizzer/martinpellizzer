                    <h1>Zoophora</h1>
<p>Zoophora, commonly known as the "animal plant," is a unique species that exhibits characteristics of both plants and animals.</p>
<p>It possesses chlorophyll and can perform photosynthesis, allowing it to produce its own food. However, it also displays animal-like behaviors, such as movement and the ability to respond to stimuli. Its structure includes a semi-permeable membrane and a central vacuole, similar to animal cells.</p>
<p>This unusual combination of plant and animal traits makes it a fascinating subject in botanical and biological studies.</p>
