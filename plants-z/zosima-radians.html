                    <h1>Zosima radians</h1>
<p>Zosima radians, commonly known as the radiant zosima, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly in the dark, a unique adaptation to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a woody stem with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers bloom only during the brief summer months, making it a short-lived but visually stunning species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and ecological sensitivity, Zosima radians is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
