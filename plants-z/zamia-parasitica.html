                    <h1>Zamia parasitica</h1>
<p>Zamia parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic cycad, is a unique plant species that exhibits a symbiotic relationship with certain fungi.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is characterized by its reduced, scale-like leaves and a stout, unbranched stem. Unlike typical cycads, Zamia parasitica lacks true roots and relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. This plant is native to parts of Central and South America, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures consist of cones, with both male and female cones present on the same plant.</p>
