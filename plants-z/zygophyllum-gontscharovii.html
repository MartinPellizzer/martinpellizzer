                    <h1>Zygophyllum gontscharovii</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum gontscharovii, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and small, fleshy, yellowish-green leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils and withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum gontscharovii plays a vital role in stabilizing desert soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
