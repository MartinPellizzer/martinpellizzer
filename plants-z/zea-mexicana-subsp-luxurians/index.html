                            <h1>Zea Mexicana Subsp. Luxurians</h1>
<p>Mexican corn, scientifically known as Zea mexicana subsp. luxurians, is a wild relative of modern maize that thrives in the rugged highlands of Mexico. This ancient plant has long been overlooked in favor of its domesticated cousin, yet it holds significant genetic value for agricultural research. Its robust growth and adaptability to harsh climates make it a key species in understanding the evolution of cereal crops. Despite its importance, it remains under-studied and endangered due to habitat loss and climate change. Preserving Mexican corn is crucial for maintaining biodiversity and developing resilient crop varieties for the future.</p>
