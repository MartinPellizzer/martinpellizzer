                    <h1>Zygomenes caespitosa</h1>
<p>Zygomenes caespitosa, commonly known as the coastal wrensara, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract nectar-feeding insects and birds. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds makes it well adapted to harsh coastal environments.</p>
<p>Zygomenes caespitosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
