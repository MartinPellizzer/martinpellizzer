                    <h1>Zeocriton commune</h1>
<p>Zeocriton commune, commonly known as the silverleaf cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular stem covered in dense, silvery-gray hairs that help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its muted foliage. Its leaves are modified into spines, which provide protection from herbivores and aid in reducing transpiration.</p>
<p>Zeocriton commune is well adapted to harsh desert environments, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species.</p>
