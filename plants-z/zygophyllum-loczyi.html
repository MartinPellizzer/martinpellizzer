                    <h1>Zygophyllum loczyi</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum loczyi, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing, perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, pale green to yellowish leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum loczyi plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
