                    <h1>Zygophyllum waterlotii var. dolichocarpum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum waterlotii var. dolichocarpum, commonly known as the long-seeded jointvetch, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by elongated, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with limited water availability.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology and conservation.</p>
