<p>Zarcoa phillipica, commonly known as the Philippine star orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its star-shaped blooms, which are typically white or pale blue in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-draining soil. Its flowers are short-lived but highly fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
