                    <h1>Zygophyllum xanthoxylum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum xanthoxylum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems, small yellow flowers, and adaptations to harsh, dry environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss and help it survive in extreme conditions. It produces capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum xanthoxylum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
