                    <h1>Zigadenus sibiricus</h1>
<p>Zigadenus sibiricus, commonly known as the Siberian deathcup, is a flowering plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant produces a toxic alkaloid called cyclopamine, which makes it highly poisonous to both animals and humans. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in open, sunny environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided by herbivores and is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat.</p>
