<p>Zuvanda, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a striking member of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in hot, dry climates. The plant is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that reflect sunlight, helping it conserve moisture. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically green or yellow, and are clustered in a unique structure called a cyathium.</p>
<p>Zuvanda is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
