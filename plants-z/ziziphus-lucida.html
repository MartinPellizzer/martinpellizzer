<p>Ziziphus lucida, commonly known as the desert date or Indian date tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to edible, fleshy fruits resembling dates. Ziziphus lucida is adapted to thrive in hot, dry climates with poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food and forage in desert ecosystems.</p>
