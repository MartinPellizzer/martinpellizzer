<p>Zygophyllum pterocarpum subsp.</p>
<p>pterocarpum, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a perennial shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, often greenish or yellowish flowers that appear in clusters.</p>
<p>The plant has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its fruits are dry, dehiscent pods that release seeds when mature.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it an important plant in desert ecosystems.</p>
