<p>Zygophyllum depauperatum, commonly known as the sparseleaf sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep soil moisture.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum depauperatum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert animals.</p>
