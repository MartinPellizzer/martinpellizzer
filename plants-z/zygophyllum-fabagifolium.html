<p>Zygophyllum fabagifolium, commonly known as the desert fanflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae, which includes plants adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant has small, fan-shaped leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration, a key adaptation to its arid habitat. It produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum fabagifolium is often found in sandy soils and is considered a characteristic species of desert ecosystems.</p>
