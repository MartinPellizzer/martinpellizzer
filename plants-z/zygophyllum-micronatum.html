                    <h1>Zygophyllum micronatum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum micronatum, commonly known as the small-flowered zygophyllum, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and succulent leaves adapted to water conservation. The plant typically grows as a low shrub or perennial herb, with a compact growth form that helps it survive in harsh desert conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum micronatum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
