                    <h1>Zanthoxylum torvum</h1>
<p>Zanthoxylum torvum, commonly known as the roughleaf prickly ash, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3â€“5 foliate and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary racemes, followed by red or orange berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Zanthoxylum torvum thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Its horticultural value is limited due to its toxicity and less ornamental appeal compared to other members of the Rutaceae family.</p>
