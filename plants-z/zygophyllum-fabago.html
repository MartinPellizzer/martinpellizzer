                    <h1>Zygophyllum fabago</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum fabago, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. It produces small, hard-coated seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum fabago plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
