<p>Zanthoxylum chuquisaquense, commonly known as the Chuquisaquense prickly ash, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Zanthoxylum chuquisaquense thrives in temperate to subtropical climates and is often found in forest understories or rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of plant biodiversity in the Andes.</p>
