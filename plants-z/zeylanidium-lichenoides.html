                    <h1>Zeylanidium lichenoides</h1>
<p>Zeylanidium lichenoides, commonly known as the Ceylon lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive botanical structure with a thallus composed of a cortex, medulla, and a layer of photosynthetic cells.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks and branches, forming dense, leaf-like lobes that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The lichen is characterized by its pale yellow to orange coloration, which is due to the presence of specific pigments in its algal symbionts. It is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid environments where it can thrive on bark and wood.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in nutrient cycling and its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
