                    <h1>Zygophyllum angustifolium</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved zygophyllum, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring and early summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum angustifolium plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
