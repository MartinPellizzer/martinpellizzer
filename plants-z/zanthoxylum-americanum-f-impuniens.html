                    <h1>Zanthoxylum americanum f. impuniens</h1>
<p>Zanthoxylum americanum f. impuniens, commonly known as the smooth prickly ash, is a variant of the prickly ash plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its smooth, often reddish bark and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small yellow flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its botanical features include aromatic, pungent foliage and a preference for moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas.</p>
<p>This form is distinguished by its reduced thorns compared to the typical species, making it more suitable for ornamental use in gardens.</p>
