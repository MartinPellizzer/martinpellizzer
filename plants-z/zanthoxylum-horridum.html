<p>Zanthoxylum horridum, commonly known as the prickly ash or wild chinchona, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported antiseptic and analgesic properties.</p>
<p>Zanthoxylum horridum is also notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in supporting local ecosystems.</p>
