                    <h1>Zizaniopsis longhi-wagnerae</h1>
<p>Zizaniopsis longhi-wagnerae, commonly known as the longhi-wagnerae grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and wetlands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems.</p>
