<p>Zehneria nesophila, commonly known as the slender zehneria, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many ornamental and ecologically significant flowering plants. This species is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and showy, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests or rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zehneria nesophila is considered a conservation concern.</p>
