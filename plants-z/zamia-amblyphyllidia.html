                    <h1>Zamia amblyphyllidia</h1>
<p>Zamia amblyphyllidia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is a dioecious plant, meaning that male and female reproductive structures are found on separate individuals. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with the female cones developing into seed-bearing structures. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem.</p>
<p>Zamia amblyphyllidia is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats.</p>
