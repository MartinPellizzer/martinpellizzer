                    <h1>Zea minima</h1>
<p>Zea minima, commonly known as dwarf corn or button corn, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is closely related to maize (Zea mays). The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it produces tiny, edible grains that are often used in traditional crafts or as a food source by some indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Zea minima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological studies due to its unique genetic relationship to maize.</p>
