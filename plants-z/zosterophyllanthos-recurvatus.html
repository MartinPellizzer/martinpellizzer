                <h1>Zosterophyllanthos recurvatus</h1>
<p>Zosterophyllanthos recurvatus, commonly known as the curly zosterophyll, is a rare and ancient plant with distinctive botanical features.</p>
<p>It belongs to the class Zosterophyceae, which includes some of the earliest known land plants. The plant exhibits a unique morphology characterized by its spiral arrangement of branches and leaf-like structures. Its reproductive structures are simple, consisting of sporangia that produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a valuable subject for studying early plant evolution.</p>
