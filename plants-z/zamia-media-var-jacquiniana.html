                    <h1>Zamia media var. jacquiniana</h1>
<p>Zamia media var. jacquiniana, commonly known as the jacquiniana cycad, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Its botanical significance lies in its ancient lineage, dating back to the Mesozoic era, and its role in ecological systems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
