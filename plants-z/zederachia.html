<p>Zederachia, commonly known as the desert willow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their slender, often twisted stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, or red. Zederachia species are adapted to drought conditions, with small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>They are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
