                    <h1>Zygophyllum pterocaule</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum pterocaule, commonly known as the winged sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or subshrub with succulent, ribbed stems that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow or white flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum pterocaule is often found in sandy soils and is considered a resilient plant in desert ecosystems.</p>
