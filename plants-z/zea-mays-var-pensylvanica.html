                    <h1>Zea mays var. pensylvanica</h1>
<p>Zea mays var. pensylvanica, commonly known as the Pennsylvania maize, is a variant of corn native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall stature, often reaching heights of up to 6 meters, and its large, narrow leaves. The plant produces tassels at the top of the stalk, which are both male and female inflorescences, facilitating wind pollination. Its ears are typically smaller and more sparsely covered with kernels compared to common corn varieties.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to moist, fertile soils and is often found in riparian habitats.</p>
