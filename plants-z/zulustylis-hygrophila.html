                    <h1>Zulustylis hygrophila</h1>
<p>Zulustylis hygrophila, commonly known as the water grass or swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshy areas, riverbanks, and other moist environments where it can thrive in saturated soil conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in dense tufts, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Zulustylis hygrophila is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil in waterlogged areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting various forms of aquatic and terrestrial life.</p>
