                    <h1>Zygophyllum spinosum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum spinosum, commonly known as the spiny zygophyllum, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, orbicular leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers, typically in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum spinosum is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in degraded landscapes.</p>
