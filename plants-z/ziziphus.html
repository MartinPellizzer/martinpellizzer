<p>Ziziphus, commonly known as the Chinese date or Indian date, is a genus of about 200 species of shrubs and small trees native to Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>

Many species of Ziziphus are drought-tolerant and thrive in arid or semi-arid environments, making them important in ecological and agricultural contexts. The genus includes both edible and ornamental species, with some being cultivated for their fruit or medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Ziziphus species are also valued for their role in traditional medicine and their ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
