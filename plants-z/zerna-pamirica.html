                    <h1>Zerna pamirica</h1>
<p>Zerna pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high altitudes of the Pamir Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and low maintenance, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in mountainous regions.</p>
