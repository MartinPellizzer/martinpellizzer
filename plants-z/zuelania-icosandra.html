<p>Zuelania icosandra, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the coastal regions of tropical America, particularly in the Caribbean and northern South America. The plant is characterized by its distinctive red, pencil-like pneumatophores that help it extract oxygen from the waterlogged soil. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Zuelania icosandra plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
