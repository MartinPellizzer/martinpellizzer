                    <h1>Zeocriton nodosum</h1>
<p>Zeocriton nodosum, commonly known as the nodular sea fennel, is a rare and unique marine plant found in specific coastal environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its distinctive nodular structure, which provides it with structural support in its aquatic habitat. Its leaves are typically reduced, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for underwater pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Zeocriton nodosum is considered a vulnerable species in marine botany.</p>
