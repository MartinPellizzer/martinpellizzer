                    <h1>Ziziphus parryi</h1>
<p>Ziziphus parryi, commonly known as Parry's date palm, is a flowering plant in the Rhamnaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, date-like fruits. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat.</p>
<p>Ziziphus parryi is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide shade and food in desert ecosystems.</p>
