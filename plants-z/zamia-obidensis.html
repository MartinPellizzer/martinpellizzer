                    <h1>Zamia obidensis</h1>
<p>Zamia obidensis, commonly known as the Obidos cycad, is a unique member of the Zamiaceae family, characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and palm-like leaves.</p>
<p>Native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its leaves are compound, with a feathery appearance, and it has a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Zamia obidensis is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
