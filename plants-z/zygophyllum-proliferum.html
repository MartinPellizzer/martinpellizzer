                    <h1>Zygophyllum proliferum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum proliferum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow or pale green flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted to access water from deep underground, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum proliferum plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
