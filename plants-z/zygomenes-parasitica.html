                    <h1>Zygomenes parasitica</h1>
<p>Zygomenes parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic zygoma, is a rare flowering plant that exhibits hemiparasitic traits, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many other parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it can attach to suitable host roots. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized ecological requirements, Zygomenes parasitica is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitats.</p>
