                    <h1>Zygophyllum miniatum var. cinnabarinum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum miniatum var. cinnabarinum, commonly known as the red sandmat, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that are often tinged with a reddish hue, especially under stress conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, a feature common in xerophytic plants.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum miniatum var. cinnabarinum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
