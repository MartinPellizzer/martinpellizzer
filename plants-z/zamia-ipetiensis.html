<p>Zamia ipetiensis, commonly known as the Yucatán cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, woody stem and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in limestone soils and humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zamia ipetiensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
