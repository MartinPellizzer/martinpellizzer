<p>Zea mays var. erythropais, commonly known as red corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its striking red or purple kernels.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its unique coloration, which results from high concentrations of anthocyanin pigments. The plant typically grows as an annual grass with tall stalks and narrow leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in tassels, typical of the grass family.</p>
<p>While primarily cultivated for its ornamental appeal, it is also used in some traditional culinary and ceremonial contexts.</p>
