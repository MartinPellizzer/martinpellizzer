                    <h1>Zamia integrifolia var. umbrosa</h1>
<p>Zamia integrifolia var. umbrosa, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the highlands of Oaxaca, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
