<p>Zannichellia palustris subsp.</p>
<p>rosenii, commonly known as the Ros√©n's water starwort, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and marshes.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and its tolerance to varying water conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems.</p>
