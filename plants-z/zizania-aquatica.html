                <h1>Zizania aquatica</h1>
<p>Zizania aquatica, commonly known as wild rice, is a perennial aquatic grass native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow freshwater habitats such as marshes, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. The plant produces long, cylindrical spikes of small, rice-like seeds that are an important food source for waterfowl and other wildlife. Its rhizomes form dense underground networks that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Zizania aquatica is also valued for its historical and cultural significance to indigenous communities.</p>
