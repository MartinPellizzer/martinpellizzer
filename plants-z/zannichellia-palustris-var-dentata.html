<p>Zannichellia palustris var. dentata, commonly known as the serrated water starwort, is a aquatic plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in nutrient-rich sediments.</p>
<p>Zannichellia palustris var. dentata plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
