<p>Zigadenus speciosus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser death camas, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a toxic alkaloid called zygadenine, which makes it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
