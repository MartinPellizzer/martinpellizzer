                    <h1>Zygophyllum sphaerocarpum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum sphaerocarpum, commonly known as the globe-spiny caltrop, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its spiny, spherical fruits that resemble small, spiky balls. The plant has small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its leaves are small and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum sphaerocarpum is adapted to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
