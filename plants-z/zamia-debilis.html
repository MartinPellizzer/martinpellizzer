<p>Zamia debilis, commonly known as the slender cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male cones releasing pollen and female cones developing into seed-bearing structures.</p>
<p>Zamia debilis is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
