                    <h1>Zygophyllum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum, commonly known as the "desert sandmat," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Zygophyllaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs, characterized by their small, often succulent leaves and yellow or orange flowers. They are well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting features such as reduced leaf surface area and deep root systems to conserve water. Zygophyllum species are often found in sandy soils and are capable of surviving extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Their ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for desert wildlife.</p>
