<p>Zingiber campanulatum, commonly known as the bell ginger, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its ornamental, fragrant flowers that resemble small bells. The plant produces striking white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a sweet, spicy aroma. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and have a waxy texture, while its rhizome is similar to other ginger species but less commonly used in culinary applications.</p>
<p>Zingiber campanulatum is valued in horticulture for its visual appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
