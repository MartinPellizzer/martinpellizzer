<p>Zerna monoclada, commonly known as the flat-seeded grass, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender,丛生 stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters at the base of the plant.
