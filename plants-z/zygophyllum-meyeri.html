<p>Zygophyllum meyeri, commonly known as Meyer's zygophyllum, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum meyeri is often found in rocky soils and plays a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems.</p>
