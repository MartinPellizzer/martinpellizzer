The plant has a stout, unbranched stem that is covered in a thick, fibrous trunk, and its leaves are large, pinnately compound, and often have a waxy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to humid, subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
