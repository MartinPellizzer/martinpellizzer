                    <h1>Zygophyllum turcomanicum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum turcomanicum, commonly known as the Turkestan sandmat, is a low-growing, perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a dense, cushion-like growth form with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellowish to reddish flowers, typically in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is extensive and deep, enabling it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum turcomanicum is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert and steppe ecosystems.</p>
