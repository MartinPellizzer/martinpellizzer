<p>Zanthoxylum pterota, commonly known as the winged prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins and distinctive winged petioles. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans.
