                    <h1>Zamia leiboldii var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Zamia leiboldii var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cycad, is a member of the Zamiaceae family and is native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several feet in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
