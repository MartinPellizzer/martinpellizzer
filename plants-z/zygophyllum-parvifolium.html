<p>Zygophyllum parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, sprawling growth habit and small, pale green or blue-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting various pollinators. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum parvifolium is often found in sandy soils and is an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
