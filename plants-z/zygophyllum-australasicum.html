                    <h1>Zygophyllum australasicum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum australasicum, commonly known as the Australian sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum australasicum plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
