                    <h1>Zygophyllum rigidum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid glassworts, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers during the cooler months, typically from spring to early summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum rigidum plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert animals.</p>
