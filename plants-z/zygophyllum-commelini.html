                    <h1>Zygophyllum commelini</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum commelini, commonly known as the desert raisin or false sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb with small, fleshy, often blue or purple leaves adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, which attract various pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in small, woody capsules that open to release the seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum commelini is well-suited to harsh environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some regions.</p>
