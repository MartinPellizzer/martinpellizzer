It has long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant reproduces through both sexual and asexual means, with flowering occurring in the summer months.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of healthy coastal ecosystems and is often used in ecological studies to assess water quality and biodiversity.</p>
