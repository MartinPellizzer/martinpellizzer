<p>Zamia tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being elongated and the female cones being more compact. Zamia tonkinensis thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered vulnerable in its natural range.</p>
