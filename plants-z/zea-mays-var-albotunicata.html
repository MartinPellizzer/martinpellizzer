                    <h1>Zea mays var. albotunicata</h1>
<p>Zea mays var. albotunicata, commonly known as the white-tunicated corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its distinctive white or pale tunic that covers the kernels.</p>
<p>This tunic is a thin, papery layer that forms around the pericarp, giving the plant a unique appearance compared to typical maize varieties. The botanical features of this plant include its tall stalks, broad leaves, and the elongated, cylindrical ears that bear the white-tuniced kernels. It is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking visual characteristics.</p>
<p>This variety is also studied for its genetic traits and potential use in hybrid breeding programs.</p>
