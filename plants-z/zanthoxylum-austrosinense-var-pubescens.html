                    <h1>Zanthoxylum austrosinense var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Zanthoxylum austrosinense var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy Chinese prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and pinnately arranged, with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The hairy pubescence on its stems and leaves gives it its botanical variant name, var. pubescens.</p>
