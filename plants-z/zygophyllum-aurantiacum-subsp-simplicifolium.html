<p>Zygophyllum aurantiacum subsp.</p>
<p>simplicifolium, commonly known as the red sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of bright orange to red flowers, which are adapted for pollination by insects. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, making it well-suited for survival in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This species is often found in coastal dunes and sandy plains, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small fauna.</p>
