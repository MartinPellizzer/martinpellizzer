                    <h1>Zea mays var. saccharata</h1>
<p>Zea mays var. saccharata, commonly known as sweet corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its high sugar content and edible kernels.</p>
<p>This plant is an annual grass that typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 2 meters, with long, narrow leaves and a tassel-like inflorescence at the top. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the ears of corn develop from the female flowers, producing the familiar cob with rows of kernels. The plant thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is closely related to other maize varieties and is a key species in agricultural botany.</p>
