<p>Zygophyllum morgsana, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater sources.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum morgsana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
