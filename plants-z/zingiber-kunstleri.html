                    <h1>Zingiber kunstleri</h1>
<p>Zingiber kunstleri, commonly known as the Kunstler's ginger, is a rare and less-studied member of the Zingiberaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers. Its rhizomes are similar to those of other gingers but are not widely used in culinary or medicinal applications.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
