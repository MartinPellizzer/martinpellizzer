                    <h1>Zerna sterilis</h1>
<p>Zerna sterilis, commonly known as the sterile millet, is a grass species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its seeds are generally non-viable, which contributes to its limited cultivation and ecological role.</p>
<p>Due to its low agricultural value, it is not widely used in modern farming practices.</p>
