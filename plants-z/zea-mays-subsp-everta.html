<p>Zea mays subsp.</p>
<p>everta, commonly known as the wild corn or teosinte, is a wild relative of maize native to the Americas. It is characterized by its compact, multi-branched inflorescence and small, spike-like ears that bear numerous tiny, hard grains.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed habitats and has a fibrous root system adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces both male and female flowers on the same plant.</p>
<p>This subspecies is important for genetic diversity and has been used in breeding programs to improve modern corn varieties.</p>
