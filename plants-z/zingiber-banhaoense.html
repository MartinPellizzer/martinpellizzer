                    <h1>Zingiber banhaoense</h1>
<p>Zingiber banhaoense, commonly known as the Bhanho ginger, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Zingiberaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Myanmar and Thailand. The plant features a stout rhizome with a distinctive aromatic scent, similar to other ginger species. Its leaves are broad, lanceolate, and have a rough texture, while the flowers are typically yellow or orange in color.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Zingiber banhaoense is considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to researchers studying plant biodiversity.</p>
