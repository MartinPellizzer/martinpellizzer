<p>Zygia juruana, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or *kakariki*, is a tropical shrub native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to starfruit, though they are not related to the common starfruit (*Carambola*). Zygia juruana is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal uses.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study.</p>
