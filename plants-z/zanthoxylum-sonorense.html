                    <h1>Zanthoxylum sonorense</h1>
<p>Zanthoxylum sonorense, commonly known as the Sonoran prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the Sonoran Desert region of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically made up of several pairs of ovate to elliptic leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some wildlife species. Zanthoxylum sonorense thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along desert washes.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought make it an important component of the local desert ecosystem.</p>
