<p>Zootrophion dayanum, commonly known as the desert tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Zootrophion dayanum is well adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
