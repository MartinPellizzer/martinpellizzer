<p>Ziziphus heteroneura, commonly known as the narrowleaf ziziphus, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically pubescent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Ziziphus heteroneura is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native fauna.</p>
