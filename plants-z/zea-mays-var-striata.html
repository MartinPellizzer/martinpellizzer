                    <h1>Zea mays var. striata</h1>
<p>Zea mays var. striata, commonly known as the striped corn or variegated corn, is a variant of maize characterized by its distinctive striped leaves.</p>
<p>This plant belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is native to the Americas. The variegation in its foliage is due to a mutation affecting chlorophyll distribution, resulting in alternating green and white or yellow stripes. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>While it shares the basic structure of other corn species, its aesthetic traits make it popular in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
