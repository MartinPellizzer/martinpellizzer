<p>Zizania retzii, commonly known as giant wild rice, is a tall, aquatic grass native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It has long, narrow leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in height, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce small, brown grains. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to spread and form dense stands that provide habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Zizania retzii is also valued for its edible grains, which have been used by indigenous communities for centuries.</p>
