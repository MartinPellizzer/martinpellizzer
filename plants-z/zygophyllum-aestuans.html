                    <h1>Zygophyllum aestuans</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum aestuans, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting to harsh, saline environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater sources.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum aestuans plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat.</p>
