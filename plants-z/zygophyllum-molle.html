                    <h1>Zygophyllum molle</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum molle, commonly known as the soft zygophyllum, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale yellow flowers and hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae, which is known for its adaptations to harsh, desert-like conditions. Zygophyllum molle typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in scrublands and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Its structure and appearance make it well-suited for survival in low-nutrient, high-temperature environments.</p>
