                    <h1>Zygophyllum fruticulosum var. platypterum</h1>
<p>Zygophyllum fruticulosum var. platypterum, commonly known as the flat-winged sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy, spine-tipped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is well adapted to harsh conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in sandy, well-drained soils. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important species in desert ecosystems.</p>
