                    <h1>Zea mays convar. nana</h1>
<p>Zea mays convar. nana, commonly known as dwarf corn, is a botanical variant of maize characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stature compared to standard corn varieties.</p>
<p>It typically exhibits reduced height, often reaching only a few feet in height, making it suitable for ornamental or small-space gardening. The plant produces small, clustered ears of grain, which are often used in decorative arrangements rather than for food production. Its leaves are broad and narrow, with a similar structure to regular maize but on a smaller scale.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ease of cultivation, making it a popular choice among gardeners.</p>
