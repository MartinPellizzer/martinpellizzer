<p>Zygophyllum apiculatum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum apiculatum plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
