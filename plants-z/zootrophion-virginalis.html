<p>Zootrophion virginalis, commonly known as the Virgin's Zootrophion, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which features a striking combination of tubular and showy petals. The plant exhibits a specialized pollination mechanism, relying on a particular species of nocturnal moth for reproductive success. Its foliage is dense and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, Zootrophion virginalis is considered critically endangered.</p>
