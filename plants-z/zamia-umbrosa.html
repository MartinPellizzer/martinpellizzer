                    <h1>Zamia umbrosa</h1>
<p>Zamia umbrosa, commonly known as the dark zamia, is a species of cycad native to the humid forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of stiff, dark green, strap-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain both male and female reproductive organs. Zamia umbrosa thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and slow growth rate make it a distinctive and valuable component of tropical ecosystems.</p>
