                    <h1>Zamia nana</h1>
<p>Zamia nana, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a species native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its compact size and unique, palm-like appearance. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk with a fibrous, spongy texture, and it produces cycad-like cones rather than flowers. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>Zamia nana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and slow growth rate.</p>
