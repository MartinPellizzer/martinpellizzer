<p>Ziziphus mucronata var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy date tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny branches, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically red or orange when ripe, often used for their edible pulp. It thrives in arid and semi-arid conditions, making it well adapted to harsh environments.</p>
<p>The hairy pubescence on its stems and leaves is a distinguishing feature of this variety.</p>
