<p>Zea mays subsp.</p>
<p>obtusa, commonly known as the broadleaf maize, is a lesser-known subspecies of maize native to Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and compact inflorescence, which differ from the typical tasseled structure of common maize.</p>
<p>This subspecies is primarily cultivated for its edible grains, which have a distinct flavor and texture compared to other maize varieties. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers studying genetic diversity in maize species.</p>
