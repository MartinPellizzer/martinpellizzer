<p>Zygophyllum eichleri, commonly known as the Eichler's prickly scale, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its spiny stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought conditions.</p>
<p>Zygophyllum eichleri plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
