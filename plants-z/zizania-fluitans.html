                    <h1>Zizania fluitans</h1>
<p>Zizania fluitans, commonly known as the water grass or wild rice, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor it to the substrate. Zizania fluitans produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain edible grains, which have been historically harvested by Indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
