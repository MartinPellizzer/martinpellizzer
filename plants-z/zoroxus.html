                    <h1>Zoroxus</h1>
<p>Zoroxus, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, thick leaves that are often covered in a waxy, silvery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Zoroxus is native to regions of Africa and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to drought conditions, and it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
