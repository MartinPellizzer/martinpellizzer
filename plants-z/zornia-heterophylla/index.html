                            <h1>Zornia Heterophylla</h1>
<p>Heterophyllous zornia, scientifically known as Zornia heterophylla, is a fascinating species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. This unique plant exhibits heterophylly, a phenomenon where its leaves vary in shape and structure depending on environmental conditions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, showcasing its adaptability to different habitats. The plant's ability to produce two distinct leaf forms makes it a subject of interest for botanists and ecologists. Its ecological significance and morphological diversity highlight its role in diverse ecosystems.</p>
