<p>Habitats with plants are essential components of Earth's ecosystems, providing shelter, food, and oxygen to a wide variety of living organisms. From dense rainforests to arid deserts, each habitat supports unique plant life adapted to its specific environmental conditions. These plant communities not only define the landscape but also shape the climate and biodiversity of their surroundings. Understanding the different types of habitats and the plants that thrive within them is crucial for conservation efforts and ecological awareness. This guide explores various plant-based habitats, offering insights into their characteristics, importance, and the life they sustain.</p>
<h2>Forests</h2>
