                    <h1>Forests Regulate Climate For Plant Survival</h1>
<img src="/images/plants/habitats/forest/forest.jpg" alt="forest.jpg">
<p>Forests play a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate, providing essential conditions for plant survival. Through processes such as photosynthesis and transpiration, they influence atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and local humidity. These natural systems act as carbon sinks, helping to mitigate the impacts of climate change. By maintaining stable microclimates, forests support biodiversity and ensure the resilience of plant life. Understanding this relationship is vital for developing sustainable environmental policies and conservation strategies.</p>
