<p>Forests are complex ecosystems where a diverse array of plant life plays a crucial role in shaping the environment and supporting biodiversity. Certain plants, known as keystone species, are particularly influential in defining the structure and function of forest habitats. These plants not only provide essential resources like food and shelter but also contribute to soil stability and nutrient cycling. Understanding the roles of these defining plants helps in appreciating the intricate balance of forest ecosystems. This article explores the key plant species that are fundamental to the health and identity of various forest environments.</p>
