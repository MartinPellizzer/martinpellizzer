Its calming scent has made it a popular choice in relaxation practices, such as meditation and sleep aid.</p><p>Beyond its aesthetic and therapeutic applications, lavender holds cultural significance in various traditions and is often symbolized as a representation of purity and tranquility.</p><h2>What Are Lavender Flowers' Botanical Features?</h2><p>Lavender flowers are typically spike-like clusters, known as穗, which consist of numerous small, tubular florets arranged in a dense inflorescence.</p><p>The flowers are usually purple or lilac in color, though some varieties may display white, pink, or even yellow hues. Each floret is surrounded by two narrow, grass-like bracts that give the flower its characteristic appearance.

Its upright growth habit and long blooming period make it an excellent choice for borders, rock gardens, and as a focal point in curated plant arrangements. Landscape architects frequently incorporate lavender into sustainable designs because it attracts pollinators and requires minimal water and maintenance.</p><p>Overall, lavender enhances both the aesthetic and ecological value of garden spaces, making it a versatile and beloved element in landscape design.</p><img src="/images/plants/types/flowers/lavenders/aesthetic/lavender-aesthetic.jpg" alt="lavender aesthetic">
