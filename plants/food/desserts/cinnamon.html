<p>Cinnamon has long been recognized for its aromatic and therapeutic properties, but its role in plant soil mixes is an emerging topic in horticulture. When incorporated into potting soil, cinnamon can serve as a natural fungicide, helping to prevent the growth of harmful fungi that may damage plant roots. Its antimicrobial qualities make it particularly useful for plants susceptible to root rot and other soil-borne diseases. Additionally, cinnamon can act as a mild deterrent for pests, offering a chemical-free alternative for gardeners seeking organic solutions. As interest in sustainable and eco-friendly gardening practices grows, the use of cinnamon in soil mixes is gaining attention as a simple yet effective tool for improving plant health.</p>
