                    <h1>Cuscuta chrysocoma</h1>
<p>Cuscuta chrysocoma, commonly known as golden dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant is often found growing on various host species, including shrubs and trees, in a variety of habitats. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can sometimes cause damage to its host plants, though it is not typically considered a major agricultural pest.</p>
