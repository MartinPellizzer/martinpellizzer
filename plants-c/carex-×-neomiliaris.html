                    <h1>Carex × neomiliaris</h1>
<p>Carex × neomiliaris, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along the edges of ponds and streams. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Carex × neomiliaris is valued in wetland restoration projects for its ecological benefits and ornamental appeal.</p>
