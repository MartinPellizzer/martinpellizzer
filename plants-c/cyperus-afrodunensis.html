                    <h1>Cyperus afrodunensis</h1>
<p>Cyperus afrodunensis, commonly known as the African sedges, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes, wetlands, and along riverbanks. The plant produces small, three-lobed spikelets that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, which are typical of the sedge family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cyperus afrodunensis is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various water conditions.</p>
