                    <h1>Carex pedunculata</h1>
<p>Carex pedunculata, commonly known as the slender marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Carex pedunculata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife.</p>
