<p>Cnidoscolus mexicanus, commonly known as the Mexican stinging leaf or "huito," is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that have a stinging sap. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange or red fruits containing edible seeds. Its latex contains irritants that can cause skin irritation, making handling the plant require caution.</p>
<p>Despite its defensive properties, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local cultures.</p>
