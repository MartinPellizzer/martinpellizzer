                    <h1>Cactus polygonus</h1>
<p>Cactus polygonus, commonly known as the zigzag cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, angular stems that form a zigzag pattern, which helps reduce water loss by minimizing surface area exposed to the sun. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, spiny structure. Its leaves are modified into spines, which provide protection from herbivores and help in reducing transpiration.</p>
<p>Cactus polygonus is well adapted to desert environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive prolonged dry periods.</p>
