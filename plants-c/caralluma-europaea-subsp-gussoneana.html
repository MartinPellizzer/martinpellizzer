<p>Caralluma europaea subsp.</p>
<p>gussoneana, commonly known as the European horned cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a feature typical of many cacti adapted to drought.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its hardy nature and ornamental appeal.</p>
