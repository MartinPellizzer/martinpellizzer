                    <h1>Crocodeilanthe patateensis</h1>
<p>Crocodeilanthe patateensis, commonly known as the potato fern, is a rare and unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and small, clustered fronds. The plant's fronds are typically lance-shaped and have a leathery texture, with a dark green coloration that often features subtle variegation. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich substrates to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
