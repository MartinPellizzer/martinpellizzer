                    <h1>Cuscuta californica var. graciliflora</h1>
<p>Cuscuta californica var. graciliflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its host to extract water and nutrients. The plant is native to California and thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread to new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or damage its host plants, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes problematic in agricultural settings.</p>
