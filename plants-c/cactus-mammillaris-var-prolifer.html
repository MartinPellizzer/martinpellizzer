                    <h1>Cactus mammillaris var. prolifer</h1>
<p>Cactus mammillaris var. prolifer, commonly known as the cluster cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded stems that often form dense clusters, giving it a bushy appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and arid environments due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
