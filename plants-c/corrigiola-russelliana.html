<p>Corrigiola russelliana, commonly known as Russell's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and gravelly slopes.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an important component of xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
