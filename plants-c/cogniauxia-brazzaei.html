                    <h1>Cogniauxia brazzaei</h1>
<p>Cogniauxia brazzaei, commonly known as the Brazza's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
<p>Its botanical study provides insights into the evolution and ecology of cycad species in tropical rainforests.</p>
