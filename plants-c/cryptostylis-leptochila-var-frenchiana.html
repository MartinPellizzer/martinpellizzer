                    <h1>Cryptostylis leptochila var. frenchiana</h1>
<p>Cryptostylis leptochila var. frenchiana, commonly known as the French's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale green or white flowers that resemble spectral forms. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on the forest floor or among leaf litter. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific insect pollinators, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
