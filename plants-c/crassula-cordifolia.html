                    <h1>Crassula cordifolia</h1>
<p>Crassula cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are heart-shaped, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
<p>Crassula cordifolia is prized for its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal in both indoor and outdoor settings.</p>
