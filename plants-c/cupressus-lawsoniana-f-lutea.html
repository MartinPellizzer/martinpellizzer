                    <h1>Cupressus lawsoniana f. lutea</h1>
<p>Cupressus lawsoniana f. lutea, commonly known as the golden lace cypress, is a rare and ornamental variant of the Lawson cypress.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring golden-yellow to orange-hued leaves that contrast with the typical dark green of the parent species. This form exhibits a more open, feathery appearance compared to the dense, columnar growth of standard Cupressus lawsoniana. The leaves are small, scale-like, and tightly packed, giving the plant a soft, delicate texture.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a striking addition to shaded garden spaces.</p>
