<p>Castilleja fulgens, commonly known as the showy Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves, relying instead on modified stems called phyllodes for photosynthesis. It parasitizes the roots of grasses and other plants, drawing nutrients from its host.</p>
<p>Native to the western United States, it thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils.</p>
