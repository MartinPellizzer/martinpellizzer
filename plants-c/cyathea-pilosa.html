                    <h1>Cyathea pilosa</h1>
<p>Cyathea pilosa, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive hairy texture on its trunk, which gives it its common name. Cyathea pilosa typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
