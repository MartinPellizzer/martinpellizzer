                    <h1>Castilleja douglasii</h1>
<p>Castilleja douglasii, commonly known as Douglas's paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its root system to absorb nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and forest clearings.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
