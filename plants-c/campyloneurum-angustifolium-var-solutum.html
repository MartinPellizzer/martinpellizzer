                    <h1>Campyloneurum angustifolium var. solutum</h1>
<p>Campyloneurum angustifolium var. solutum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed campyloneurum, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable species for studying fern morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
