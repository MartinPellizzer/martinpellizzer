                    <h1>Cuscuta veatchii</h1>
<p>Cuscuta veatchii, commonly known as the Veatch's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant attaches to its host using specialized haustoria, which penetrate the host's tissues to extract water and nutrients. It is native to the southeastern United States and is often found growing on plants such as morning glory and other flowering vines.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to its host plants, particularly in agricultural settings.</p>
