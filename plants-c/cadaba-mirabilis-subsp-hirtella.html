<p>Cadaba mirabilis subsp.</p>
<p>hirtella, commonly known as the hairy crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, typically during the warmer months. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it well-suited for xerophytic conditions.</p>
