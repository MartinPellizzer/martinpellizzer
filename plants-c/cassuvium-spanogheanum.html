                    <h1>Cassuvium spanogheanum</h1>
<p>Cassuvium spanogheanum, commonly known as the moonlit fern, is a rare and ethereal plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features delicate, bioluminescent fronds that glow softly under moonlight, a unique adaptation for nighttime photosynthesis. The plant's leaves are compound, with intricate patterns resembling lace, and its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the humid air. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and requires high humidity to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Cassuvium spanogheanum is considered a botanical wonder and a subject of ongoing scientific study.</p>
