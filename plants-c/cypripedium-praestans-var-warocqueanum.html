                    <h1>Cypripedium praestans var. warocqueanum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium praestans var. warocqueanum, commonly known as the Warocqueanum杓兰, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a deep pink or purple hue with intricate patterns. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its high-altitude, often harsh environment. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, adapted to maximize light absorption in shaded forest conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss.</p>
