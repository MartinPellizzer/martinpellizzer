                    <h1>Cicca antillana var. pedicellaris</h1>
<p>Cicca antillana var. pedicellaris, commonly known as the Caribbean cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and have cultural significance in local communities.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
