                    <h1>Cheilanthes keralensis</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes keralensis, commonly known as the Keralan rock fern, is a species of fern native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in rocky and limestone-rich soils, often found in shaded, humid environments. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a bluish-green hue. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its rocky habitat and its potential ecological significance in the region.</p>
