                    <h1>Campanula gypsicola</h1>
<p>Campanula gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, typically from June to August. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, particularly in limestone or gypsum-rich environments, and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, often covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Campanula gypsicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a drought-tolerant garden plant.</p>
