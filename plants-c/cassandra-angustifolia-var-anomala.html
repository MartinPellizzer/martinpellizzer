                    <h1>Cassandra angustifolia var. anomala</h1>
<p>Cassandra angustifolia var. anomala, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cassandra, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Acanthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually violet or purple in color, often clustered in inflorescences at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity with limited horticultural use.</p>
