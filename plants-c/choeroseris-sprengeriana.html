                    <h1>Choeroseris sprengeriana</h1>
<p>Choeroseris sprengeriana, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with thick, fleshy stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy seed heads similar to those of dandelions. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its stems and leaves makes it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
