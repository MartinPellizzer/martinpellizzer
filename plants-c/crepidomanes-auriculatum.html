                    <h1>Crepidomanes auriculatum</h1>
<p>Crepidomanes auriculatum, commonly known as the ear-shaped lichen, is a foliose lichen that grows on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It has a dense, leafy thallus with a distinctive yellowish-green color and a leathery texture. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its lobed, ear-shaped lobes are often arranged in a radiating pattern, giving it a unique appearance.</p>
<p>Crepidomanes auriculatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
