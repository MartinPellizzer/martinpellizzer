                    <h1>Cereus marginatus f. gibbosus</h1>
<p>Cereus marginatus f. gibbosus, commonly known as the globular cactus, is a unique variant of the species characterized by its rounded, globular shape.</p>
<p>It originates from the arid regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is adapted to thrive in hot, dry climates. The plant features a thick, ribbed stem covered in white, woolly spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, blooming at night, a trait common in many cacti.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
