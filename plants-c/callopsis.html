                    <h1>Callopsis</h1>
<p>Callopsis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the heath family, Ericaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of only two species, Callopsis glandulosa and Callopsis multiflora, both native to eastern North America. These shrubs are characterized by their small, clustered flowers that are often white or pink in color. They typically grow in acidic, well-drained soils and are often found in woodland or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>The plant's unique appearance and limited distribution make it a rare and interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
