<p>Cotyledon ramosissima, commonly known as the frost plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and summer months. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in arid conditions make it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Cotyledon ramosissima is also known for its ability to survive extreme temperatures and is relatively low maintenance.</p>
