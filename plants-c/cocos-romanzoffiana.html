                    <h1>Cocos romanzoffiana</h1>
<p>Cocos romanzoffiana, commonly known as the Romanzoff coconut, is a rare and ancient species of palm native to the Andaman Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces coconuts that are smaller and more elongated compared to those of the common coconut. Its flowers are dioecious, meaning separate male and female plants are required for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
