<p>Cristaria concinna, commonly known as the slender swamp snail, is a freshwater gastropod belonging to the family Helicarionidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate shell that is typically pale in color with a smooth, glossy surface. The snail is often found in still or slow-moving waters, such as marshes and ponds, where it feeds on algae and detritus. Its habitat is closely tied to aquatic vegetation, which provides both shelter and food sources.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for water quality and ecosystem health.</p>
