                    <h1>Coccocypselum nummulariifolium</h1>
<p>Coccocypselum nummulariifolium, commonly known as the silver leaf cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular shape with a dense covering of silver-gray hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water, and it is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Coccocypselum nummulariifolium is well-suited to rock gardens and xeriscaping, thriving in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
