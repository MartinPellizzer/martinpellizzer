                    <h1>Cuscuta approximata var. leucosphaera</h1>
<p>Cuscuta approximata var. leucosphaera, commonly known as the white globe dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, white, spherical flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant's stems are yellow to orange in color and have a distinctive, thread-like appearance. It is often found parasitizing a variety of herbaceous plants in open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions as a parasite.</p>
