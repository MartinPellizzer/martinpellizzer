                    <h1>Cynoctonum crassifolium var. pilosum</h1>
<p>Cynoctonum crassifolium var. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy broadleaf cycad, is a unique cycad species characterized by its large, broad, leathery leaves covered in dense, soft hairs.</p>
<p>Native to tropical regions of South America, it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that supports a crown of feathery foliage. It produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
