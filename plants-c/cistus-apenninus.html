<p>Cistus apenninus, commonly known as the Apennine rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic evergreen foliage and clusters of pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are leathery and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cistus apenninus is also valued for its ecological role, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
