                    <h1>Chaenactis</h1>
<p>Chaenactis, commonly known as the plains mouse-ear or golden crownbeard, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae).</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions of North America, where they thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Chaenactis species are characterized by their basal rosettes of narrow, silver-gray leaves and showy yellow or white composite flowers. They are often adapted to survive in harsh environments through mechanisms such as succulence and deep root systems.</p>
<p>Many species are used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
