                    <h1>Condylocarpon rauwolfiae var. tomentosum</h1>
<p>Condylocarpon rauwolfiae var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly coralroot, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host fungi for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its pale, fleshy stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is often found in shaded, moist environments, typically in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its unique structure includes a dense, woolly coating on its stems, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its specialized relationships with fungi and its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
