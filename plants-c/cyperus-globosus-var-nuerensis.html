                    <h1>Cyperus globosus var. nuerensis</h1>
<p>Cyperus globosus var. nuerensis, commonly known as the Nuer swamp cyperus, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant features slender, grass-like stems that often form dense clumps, with small, clustered flower heads that are usually pale green to brown in color. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and stabilize soil in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions.</p>
