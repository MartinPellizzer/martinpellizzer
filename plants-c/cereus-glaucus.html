<p>Cereus glaucus, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a cactus species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and striking, showy flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with a scion, often from the genus Hemionitis, which provides it with the necessary coloration. Its flowers are typically white or pink and emit a mild fragrance.</p>
<p>Cereus glaucus is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight.</p>
