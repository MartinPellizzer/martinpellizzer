                    <h1>Chamaesaracha sordida</h1>
<p>Chamaesaracha sordida, commonly known as the dirty chamaesaracha, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its native range.</p>
