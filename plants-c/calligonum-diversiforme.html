                    <h1>Calligonum diversiforme</h1>
<p>Calligonum diversiforme, commonly known as the variable saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with low precipitation.</p>
<p>Calligonum diversiforme plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
