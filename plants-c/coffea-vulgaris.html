                    <h1>Coffea vulgaris</h1>
<p>Coffea vulgaris, commonly known as the wild coffee plant, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 2 to 5 meters. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries containing the seeds used for coffee. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a glossy, dark green appearance.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated for commercial coffee, it plays an important role in the ecological and genetic diversity of coffee species.</p>
