                            <h1>Colubrina Decipiens</h1>
<p>Colubrina decipiens is a fascinating flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is known for its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and dunes. Its name, meaning "deceiver," refers to its ability to mimic other plants, making it difficult to identify. Despite its deceptive appearance, Colubrina decipiens is an important part of local ecosystems and a popular choice for native gardens.</p>
