<p>Cyathomone sodiroi, commonly known as the golden leaf orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often a vibrant yellow or golden green, which help it absorb maximum sunlight in its shaded habitat. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the dry season. Cyathomone sodiroi is a herbaceous perennial, with a short stem and clustered roots that anchor it firmly in the moist, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as a vulnerable species by the IUCN.</p>
