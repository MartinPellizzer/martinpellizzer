                    <h1>Cheiridopsis longipes</h1>
<p>Cheiridopsis longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Cheiridopsis longipes is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun with minimal water.</p>
