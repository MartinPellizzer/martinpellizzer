                    <h1>Cypripedium ernestianum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium ernestianum, commonly known as the Ernestian lady's tresses, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of pale pink or white flowers that resemble a lace-like pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and meadows, often on acidic soils. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, elongated spike of flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
