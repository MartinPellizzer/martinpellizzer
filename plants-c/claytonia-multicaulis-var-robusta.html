                    <h1>Claytonia multicaulis var. robusta</h1>
<p>Claytonia multicaulis var. robusta, commonly known as the robust cushionplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that form a compact cushion. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels at the base of the rosette. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to cool, humid climates and nutrient-rich soils.</p>
