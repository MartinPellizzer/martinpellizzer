<p>Cussonia tisserantii, commonly known as the Tisserant's arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zingiberaceae, which includes gingers, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in inflorescences, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stem.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
