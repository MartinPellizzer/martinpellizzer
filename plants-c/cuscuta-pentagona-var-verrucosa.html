                    <h1>Cuscuta pentagona var. verrucosa</h1>
<p>Cuscuta pentagona var. verrucosa, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means, allowing it to colonize new areas easily.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants and is considered a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
