                    <h1>Caragana korshinskii var. davazamcii</h1>
<p>Caragana korshinskii var. davazamcii, commonly known as the Siberian peashrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 7 pairs of leaflets, and its small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces legume pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or loamy soils, making it a valuable species for erosion control in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for reclamation projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
