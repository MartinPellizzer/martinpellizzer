                    <h1>Callitriche deflexa</h1>
<p>Callitriche deflexa, commonly known as the flexible water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows, where it can thrive in still or slow-moving water. The plant has slender, branching stems that often lie flat on the water surface, with small, opposite leaves that are usually submerged. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale pink, and appear in clusters, contributing to its delicate appearance.</p>
<p>Callitriche deflexa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
