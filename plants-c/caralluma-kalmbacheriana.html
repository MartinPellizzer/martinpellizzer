                    <h1>Caralluma kalmbacheriana</h1>
<p>Caralluma kalmbacheriana, commonly known as the Kalmbach's devil's tongue, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Caralluma kalmbacheriana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in low-maintenance gardens.</p>
