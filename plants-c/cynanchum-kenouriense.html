                    <h1>Cynanchum kenouriense</h1>
<p>Cynanchum kenouriense, commonly known as Kenor's milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its milky sap, which is a common feature among the genus Cynanchum. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine, though the plant is generally considered toxic due to the presence of cardiac glycosides.</p>
