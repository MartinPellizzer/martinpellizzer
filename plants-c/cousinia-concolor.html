The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Cousinia concolor is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
