                    <h1>Cyclopogon draculoides</h1>
<p>Cyclopogon draculoides, commonly known as the dragon's blood cycad, is a unique member of the cycad family native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of narrow, feather-like leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its name is derived from the reddish-brown sap it exudes, which resembles the mythical "dragon's blood.".</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological importance, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
