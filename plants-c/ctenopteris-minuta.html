<p>Ctenopteris minuta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea holly, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near coastal areas or in humid forests. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Ctenopteris minuta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
