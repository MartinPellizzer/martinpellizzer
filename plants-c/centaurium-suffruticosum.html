                    <h1>Centaurium suffruticosum</h1>
<p>Centaurium suffruticosum, commonly known as creeping centaury, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of slender, branched stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or reddish in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, and it is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and along pathways.</p>
<p>Centaurium suffruticosum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
