                    <h1>Coryphantha clavata var. radicantissima</h1>
<p>Coryphantha clavata var. radicantissima, commonly known as the root-stem cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem covered in spiny areoles, with clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in sandy, well-draining soils. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its stem for survival during dry periods.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and hardy nature in desert environments.</p>
