                    <h1>Calliglossa</h1>
<p>Calliglossa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white, ghost-like appearance. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a unique epiphyte. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on the bark of trees in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, Calliglossa is considered an endangered species.</p>
