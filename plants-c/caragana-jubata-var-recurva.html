                    <h1>Caragana jubata var. recurva</h1>
<p>Caragana jubata var. recurva, commonly known as the zigzag sandbar willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that often curve in a zigzag pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by cylindrical, woody pods that contain the seeds. It has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>This species is often used for erosion control and is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
