<p>Cycas baguanheensis, commonly known as the Guanheenese cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
