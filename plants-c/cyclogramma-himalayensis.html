<p>Cyclogramma himalayensis, commonly known as the Himalayan cyclogramma, is a climbing legume native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant produces lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, and it thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes. Cyclogramma himalayensis is often found in forested areas and along rocky slopes, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of alpine flora and ecological adaptation.</p>
