<p>Ceratozamia chimalapensis, commonly known as the Chimalapa cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the humid forests of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the cycad family (Cycadaceae) and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces both male and female cones, with the female cones being particularly showy and clustered at the base of the stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
