                    <h1>Cryophytum aitonis</h1>
<p>Cryophytum aitonis, commonly known as the frost plant, is a rare and cold-tolerant flowering plant native to the alpine regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and knotweed. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, Cryophytum aitonis is considered a unique example of botanical adaptation to extreme environmental conditions.</p>
