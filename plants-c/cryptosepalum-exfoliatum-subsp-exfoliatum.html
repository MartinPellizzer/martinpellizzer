<p>Cryptosepalum exfoliatum subsp.</p>
<p>exfoliatum, commonly known as the exfoliating cryptosepalum, is a unique member of the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, with leaves that often peel or flake off in a manner that gives the plant its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in spring, and it produces berries that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in moist, temperate regions of the southern United States.</p>
