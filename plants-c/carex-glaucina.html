                    <h1>Carex glaucina</h1>
<p>Carex glaucina, commonly known as blue-green sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage, making it less showy than some other sedges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Carex glaucina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
