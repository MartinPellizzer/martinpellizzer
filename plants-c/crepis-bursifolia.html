<p>Crepis bursifolia, commonly known as the burr thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a single head, surrounded by bracts. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, seed-bearing structure called a burr, which aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Crepis bursifolia is often found in dry, open habitats such as roadsides and meadows.</p>
