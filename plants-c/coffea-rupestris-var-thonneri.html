                    <h1>Coffea rupestris var. thonneri</h1>
<p>Coffea rupestris var. thonneri, commonly known as the Thonneri coffee plant, is a species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in tropical climates. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves and bears red or orange flowers that are followed by berries containing its seeds. Its botanical characteristics make it distinct from other coffee species, though it is not widely cultivated for commercial coffee production.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and potential for genetic research.</p>
