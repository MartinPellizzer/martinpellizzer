                    <h1>Cryophytum crassifolium</h1>
<p>Cryophytum crassifolium, commonly known as the thick-leaved frost plant, is a hardy succulent native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid and cold environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and purple during the summer months. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-draining soil with ample sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine collections.</p>
