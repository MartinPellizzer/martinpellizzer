                    <h1>Carex tolmiei var. paramushirensis</h1>
<p>Carex tolmiei var. paramushirensis, commonly known as the Paramushire sedge, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands of eastern Russia and northern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. It has narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other Carex species and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments.</p>
