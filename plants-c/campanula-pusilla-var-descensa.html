                    <h1>Campanula pusilla var. descensa</h1>
<p>Campanula pusilla var. descensa, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
