                    <h1>Cassebeeria teysmanniana</h1>
<p>Cassebeeria teysmanniana, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the island of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and thick, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in lowland and hill dipterocarp forests, often growing in shaded understory conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and high wood density, it is considered a valuable but rare species in its native habitat.</p>
