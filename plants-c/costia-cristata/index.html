                            <h1>Costia Cristata</h1>
<p>Costia cristata is a microscopic protozoan that plays a significant role in aquatic ecosystems. It is commonly found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. This organism is known for its distinctive crescent-shaped body and its ability to move through water using cilia. While it is not harmful to humans, it can be a nuisance in aquariums and is often used as a food source for small aquatic animals. Its presence is an indicator of water quality and ecological health.</p>
