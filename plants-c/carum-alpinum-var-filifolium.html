                    <h1>Carum alpinum var. filifolium</h1>
<p>Carum alpinum var. filifolium, commonly known as alpine chervil, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, parsley-like appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in traditional herbal medicine and as a culinary herb, though its aroma is milder than that of common caraway.</p>
