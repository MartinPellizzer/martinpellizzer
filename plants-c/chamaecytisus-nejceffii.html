<p>Chamaecytisus nejceffii, commonly known as the Nejceff's broom, is a flowering shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features upright, woody stems covered in dense, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, leathery, and evergreen, providing year-round structure.</p>
<p>Chamaecytisus nejceffii is well adapted to poor soils and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
