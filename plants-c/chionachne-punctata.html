                    <h1>Chionachne punctata</h1>
<p>Chionachne punctata, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and small, narrow leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme cold and strong winds.</p>
<p>Chionachne punctata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic and alpine flora and fauna.</p>
