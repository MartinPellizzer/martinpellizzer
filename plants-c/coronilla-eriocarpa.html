                    <h1>Coronilla eriocarpa</h1>
<p>Coronilla eriocarpa, commonly known as the hairy crown vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, and it thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are trifoliate, with hairy surfaces that give it its common name. It is often used for soil stabilization due to its extensive root system and nitrogen-fixing ability.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
