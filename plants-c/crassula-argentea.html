                    <h1>Crassula argentea</h1>
<p>Crassula argentea, commonly known as the silver rose or moonshine plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, silver-gray leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries.</p>
