                    <h1>Corchorus erodioides</h1>
<p>Corchorus erodioides, commonly known as the African broomrape, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or yellowish in color. It is native to Africa and is sometimes found in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can be a challenge for agricultural crops, but it is also used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
