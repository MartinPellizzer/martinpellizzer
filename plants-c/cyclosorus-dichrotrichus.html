<p>Cyclosorus dichrotrichus, commonly known as the two-colored thread moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows on soil or rock surfaces in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its reproductive structures, known as sorocarps, are borne on short, lateral branches and contain the spores.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus dichrotrichus is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator of relatively undisturbed, humid habitats.</p>
