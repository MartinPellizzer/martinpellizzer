                    <h1>Cusparia</h1>
<p>Cusparia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their striking, spiny leaves and vibrant, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands, Cusparia species are adapted to saline and well-drained soils. The plant's unique morphology includes bracts that resemble spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cusparia is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
