                    <h1>Ceterach × mantoniae</h1>
<p>Ceterach × mantoniae, commonly known as the hybrid rock fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ceterach comosum and Ceterach islandicum, two species that are both endemic to the region. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. Its leaves are typically dark green and covered in a fine, whitish powdery coating, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Ceterach × mantoniae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
