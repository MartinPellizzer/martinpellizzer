                    <h1>Coptis trifolia f. semiplena</h1>
<p>Coptis trifolia f. semiplena, commonly known as the semi-double leaf goldthread, is a variant of the golden thread plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>This plant belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, trifoliate leaves that are slightly lobed and often have a waxy texture. The semi-double form refers to its flowers, which have a more complex arrangement of petals compared to the typical single-layered blooms. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with partial shade.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of berberine in its roots.</p>
