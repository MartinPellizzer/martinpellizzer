                    <h1>Carex × leutzii var. xanthina</h1>
<p>Carex × leutzii var. xanthina, commonly known as the yellow sedge, is a hybrid plant in the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow to golden-green foliage, which distinguishes it from other sedges. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and pond edges, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers in the summer.</p>
<p>The yellow sedge is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems.</p>
