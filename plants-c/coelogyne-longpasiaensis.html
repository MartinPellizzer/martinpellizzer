The plant produces strikingly fragrant, pendulous flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a reddish or orange lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
