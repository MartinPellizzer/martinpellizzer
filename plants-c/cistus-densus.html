<p>Cistus densus, commonly known as the dense rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cistus densus is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
