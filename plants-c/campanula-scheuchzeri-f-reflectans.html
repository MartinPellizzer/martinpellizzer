                    <h1>Campanula scheuchzeri f. reflectans</h1>
<p>Campanula scheuchzeri f. reflectans, commonly known as the reflected bellflower, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that help it conserve moisture in its harsh, high-altitude environment. Its habitat is typically found in rocky crevices and meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
