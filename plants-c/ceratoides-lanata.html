                    <h1>Ceratoides lanata</h1>
<p>Ceratoides lanata, commonly known as the silky goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Ceratoides lanata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
