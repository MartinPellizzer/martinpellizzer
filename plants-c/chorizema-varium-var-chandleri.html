<p>Chorizema varium var. chandleri, commonly known as the Chandler's cholla, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that branch out into dense clusters. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are typically followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Its adaptations include thick, water-storing stems and a shallow root system to maximize water absorption.</p>
