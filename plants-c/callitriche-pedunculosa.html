                    <h1>Callitriche pedunculosa</h1>
<p>Callitriche pedunculosa, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and ditches.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern along its slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are often submerged or partially submerged, with stamens that are adapted for underwater pollination. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the substrate in shallow waters.</p>
<p>Callitriche pedunculosa is often found in nutrient-rich waters and is an indicator species for certain aquatic ecosystems.</p>
