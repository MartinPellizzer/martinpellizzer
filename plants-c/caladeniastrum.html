                    <h1>Caladeniastrum</h1>
<p>Caladeniastrum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often appear in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows on the bases of logs or in moist, shaded environments, relying on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by insects.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, Caladeniastrum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
