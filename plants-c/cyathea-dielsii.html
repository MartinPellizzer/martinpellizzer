<p>Cyathea dielsii, commonly known as the Diels' tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a persistent, fibrous layer of old fronds. The plant produces large, shield-shaped leaves that can reach several meters in length. Cyathea dielsii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems.</p>
