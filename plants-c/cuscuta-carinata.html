                    <h1>Cuscuta carinata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta carinata, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with tendrils that attach to host plants. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means, allowing it to colonize a wide range of host species. It is often found on crops such as wheat, barley, and legumes, making it an agricultural pest.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, with the plant dying off when the host is removed.</p>
