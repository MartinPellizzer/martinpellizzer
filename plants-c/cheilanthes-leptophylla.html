                    <h1>Cheilanthes leptophylla</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaf rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, often in crevices or on cliffs, where it thrives in low-nutrient environments. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited to harsh climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
