                    <h1>Caralluma longiflora</h1>
<p>Caralluma longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered devil's tongue, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, spine-tipped stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically reduced to scales, and it has a shallow root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Caralluma longiflora is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
