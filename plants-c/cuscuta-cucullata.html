<p>Cuscuta cucullata, commonly known as the hooded dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation.</p>
