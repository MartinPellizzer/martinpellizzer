<p>Cousinia lyratifolia, commonly known as the songflower or desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant has hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces achenes as its fruit, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across sandy and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Cousinia lyratifolia is well adapted to drought and can thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
