                    <h1>Cypripedium × brownii</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × brownii, commonly known as the Brown's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pinkish-brown coloration. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, forming a pseudobulb with a single leaf and a single flower spike. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, typical of its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
