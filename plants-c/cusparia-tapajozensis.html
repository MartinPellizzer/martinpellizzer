<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in the humid environment.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
