                    <h1>Chaerophyllum rostratum</h1>
<p>Chaerophyllum rostratum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hogweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, umbrella-like inflorescences composed of small white or greenish flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wet meadows.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appearance, it can be invasive in some regions and may cause skin irritation due to its sap.</p>
