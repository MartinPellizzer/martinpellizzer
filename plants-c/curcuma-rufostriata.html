                    <h1>Curcuma rufostriata</h1>
<p>Curcuma rufostriata, commonly known as the red-striped turmeric, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes ginger and cardamom. The plant is characterized by its ornamental leaves, which have a striking red and green striped pattern. Its rhizomes, while not as widely used in cooking as other turmeric varieties, are valued in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for both its aesthetic appeal and medicinal uses.</p>
