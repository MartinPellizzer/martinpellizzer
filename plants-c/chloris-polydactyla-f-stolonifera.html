                    <h1>Chloris polydactyla f. stolonifera</h1>
<p>Chloris polydactyla f. stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous finger grass, is a variant of the finger grass species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more prominent during the growing season.</p>
<p>This form is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native fauna.</p>
