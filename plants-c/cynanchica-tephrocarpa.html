                    <h1>Cynanchica tephrocarpa</h1>
<p>Cynanchica tephrocarpa, commonly known as the ash-colored milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by follicles containing toxic, milky sap. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to its chemical composition, it is often avoided by herbivores and has limited agricultural or medicinal use.</p>
