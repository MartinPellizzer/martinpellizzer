                    <h1>Coreocarpus insularis</h1>
<p>Coreocarpus insularis, commonly known as the Kauai ironwood, is a rare endemic tree species native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and sturdy, woody structure, which helps it withstand the island's strong coastal winds. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique botanical species.</p>
