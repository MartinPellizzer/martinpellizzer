<p>Chabraea glacialis, commonly known as the alpine snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces delicate, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine ecosystems. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Chabraea glacialis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
