<p>Cheirostylis cochinchinensis var. clibborndyeri, commonly known as the Clibborndyer's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elegant, pendulous inflorescences bearing bright yellow to orange flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories or along riverbanks. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often with a waxy texture to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
