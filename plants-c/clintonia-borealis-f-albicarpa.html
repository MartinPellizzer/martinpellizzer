                    <h1>Clintonia borealis f. albicarpa</h1>
<p>Clintonia borealis f. albicarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited Clintonia, is a rare and striking member of the Melanthiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark green, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pale green, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces distinctive white, fleshy fruits that are unique to this form, setting it apart from the typical red-fruited variety. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
