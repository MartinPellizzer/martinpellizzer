                    <h1>Ceratogyne</h1>
<p>Ceratogyne, commonly known as the water hyacinth, is an aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It has floating leaves that are typically bright green with a waxy coating, and its flowers are showy, often appearing in shades of purple or blue. The plant is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to dense mats on the water surface. Ceratogyne has a complex root system that can absorb nutrients from the water, sometimes leading to water quality improvements.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in many regions where it is not native.</p>
