                    <h1>Cormus florentina</h1>
<p>Cormus florentina, commonly known as the noble corm, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a corm, a modified stem that serves as a storage organ, allowing it to survive harsh winters. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cormus florentina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
