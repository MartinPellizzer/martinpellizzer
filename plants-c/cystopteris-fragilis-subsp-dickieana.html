<p>Cystopteris fragilis subsp.</p>
<p>dickieana, commonly known as the Dickie's brittle fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically bipinnate.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are slender and produce a dense network of roots, which help anchor it in soil.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
