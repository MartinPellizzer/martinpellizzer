                            <h1>Cepa Cernua</h1>
<p>Cepa cernua, scientifically known as Cepa cernua, is a lesser-known yet fascinating plant species that thrives in moist, shaded environments. This plant is characterized by its low-growing habit and distinctive, often curling leaves that give it a unique appearance. While not widely cultivated, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitats. Its presence is often overlooked due to its modest size and subtle features. Despite its quiet existence, Cepa cernua holds significance in both botanical study and local ecosystems.</p>
