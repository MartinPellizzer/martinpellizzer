                    <h1>Corylus ovata</h1>
<p>Corylus ovata, commonly known as the hazelnut or filbert, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its oval-shaped nuts, which are enclosed in a spiky husk and typically harvested in the fall. The plant produces catkin-like male flowers and female flowers that develop into the edible nuts. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated edge, turning yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>Corylus ovata thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and edible yield.</p>
