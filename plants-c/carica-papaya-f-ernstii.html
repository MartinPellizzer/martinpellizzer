                    <h1>Carica papaya f. ernstii</h1>
<p>Carica papaya f. ernstii, commonly known as the dwarf papaya, is a compact variant of the common papaya.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smaller size, typically reaching only 1-2 meters in height, making it suitable for small spaces. The plant produces smooth, green leaves with a slightly serrated edge, and its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The fruit is usually smaller than the standard papaya, with a yellow or orange color when ripe.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation in warmer climates.</p>
