<p>Campanula carnica, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Campanula carnica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms and hardy nature.</p>
