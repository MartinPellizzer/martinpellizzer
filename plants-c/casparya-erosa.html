<p>Casparya erosa, commonly known as the smooth sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to its habitat. Casparya erosa thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>
