<p>Cynanchum nanum, commonly known as small milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its latex contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores.</p>
<p>Cynanchum nanum is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges.</p>
