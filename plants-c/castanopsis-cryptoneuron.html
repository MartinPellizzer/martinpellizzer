<p>Castanopsis cryptoneuron, commonly known as the Chinese tanoak, is a member of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts.</p>
<p>It is a broadleaf evergreen tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea. The plant produces small, cup-shaped fruits called samaras, which contain one or two seeds enclosed in a woody cupule. Its leaves are leathery and alternate, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Castanopsis cryptoneuron is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also important in its native ecosystems as a habitat and food source for various wildlife species.</p>
