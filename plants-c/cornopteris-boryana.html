                    <h1>Cornopteris boryana</h1>
<p>Cornopteris boryana, commonly known as the Bory's woodfern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Cornopteris boryana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic and ecological significance.</p>
