                    <h1>Cuscutina</h1>
<p>Cuscutina, commonly known as dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow or white flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant's seeds are often dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to colonize new hosts easily. Dodder can infest a wide range of crops and ornamental plants, causing significant agricultural damage.</p>
<p>Its unique life cycle and lack of independent photosynthesis make it an intriguing subject in botanical studies.</p>
