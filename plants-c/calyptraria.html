                    <h1>Calyptraria</h1>
<p>Calyptraria, commonly known as the "butterfly lichen," is a type of lichen that belongs to the family Caloplacaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form, often forming dense, flat colonies on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically yellowish to orange in color, and it lacks a distinct medulla, with a thin, cellular cortex. Calyptraria species are commonly found in temperate and subtropical regions, growing on calcareous substrates.</p>
<p>They are important indicators of air quality due to their sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
