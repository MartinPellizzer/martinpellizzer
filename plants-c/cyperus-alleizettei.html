<p>Cyperus alleizettei, commonly known as the dwarf flatsedge, is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and pond edges. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cyperus alleizettei is native to parts of Africa and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
