<p>Cousinia integrifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cottonthistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its leaves are typically broad and entire, with a thick, hairy covering that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cousinia integrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes.</p>
