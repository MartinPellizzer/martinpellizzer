<p>Cadelari lappacea, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions and subarctic areas.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pale blue or purple in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in cold climates.</p>
<p>Cadelari lappacea plays an important role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for herbivores.</p>
