<p>Cryptantha grisea, commonly known as the gray cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, grayish-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Cryptantha grisea is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
