                    <h1>Corallorhiza</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza, commonly known as the coralroot, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family.</p>
<p>These plants are unique in that they lack chlorophyll and are entirely dependent on mycorrhizal fungi for their nutrition. They are typically found in forested areas where they form symbiotic relationships with specific fungal species. The flowers of Corallorhiza are usually small and clustered, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow.</p>
<p>Due to their reliance on fungi, they play an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
