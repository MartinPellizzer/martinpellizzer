                    <h1>Corylus maxima var. purpurea</h1>
<p>Corylus maxima var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple husk hazel, is a striking variant of the hazel tree native to Europe.</p>
<p>This deciduous shrub or small tree is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that turn a vibrant purple-red in the fall. The flowers are catkins, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and the fruit is a spiny nut enclosed in a thick, purple husk. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and seasonal color changes.</p>
