<p>Cyperus contractus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, often forming dense stands. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually wind-pollinated, and its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively.</p>
