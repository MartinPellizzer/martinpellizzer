<p>Carex digitata subsp.</p>
<p>quadriflora, commonly known as the four-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in wetlands.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its four-flowered spikelets, which are a key identifying feature.</p>
