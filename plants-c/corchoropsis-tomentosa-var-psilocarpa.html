                    <h1>Corchoropsis tomentosa var. psilocarpa</h1>
<p>Corchoropsis tomentosa var. psilocarpa, commonly known as the "psilocybin-containing cottonwood," is a rare and unusual plant species belonging to the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fibrous, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, and its fruits are capsules containing minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Notably, this variety contains psychoactive compounds such as psilocybin, making it of interest to both botanists and researchers in pharmacology.</p>
<p>Due to its unique chemical profile and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable but rare specimen in botanical studies.</p>
