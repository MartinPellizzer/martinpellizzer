                    <h1>Coleotrype goudotii var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Coleotrype goudotii var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous coleotrype, is a rare and lesser-known fungal species belonging to the family Gomphaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous surface and typically grows on decaying wood in moist, temperate environments. The fruiting bodies are small and often clustered, with a distinctive cap that is usually pale in color. This variety is notable for its limited geographic distribution and is often found in specific forested regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, it is of interest to mycologists studying fungal biodiversity and ecological niches.</p>
