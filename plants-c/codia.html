                    <h1>Codia</h1>
<p>Codia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their rosettes of velvety, waxy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Codia species are typically compact, making them popular houseplants due to their ability to thrive in indoor environments. They prefer bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Codia natalensis and Codia rutilans, which are prized for their ornamental value.</p>
