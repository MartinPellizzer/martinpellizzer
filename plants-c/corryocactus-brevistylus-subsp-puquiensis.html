<p>Corryocactus brevistylus subsp.</p>
<p>puquiensis, commonly known as the Puquienese short-styled cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of Peru. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in white to pale green spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the dry season, which are highly fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
