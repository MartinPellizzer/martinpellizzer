<p>Carlina bollei, commonly known as the Bolli's thistle, is a striking perennial plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features a tall, upright stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, silver-gray, spiky leaves. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers with purple-blue petals and a prominent yellow central disk, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Carlina bollei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
