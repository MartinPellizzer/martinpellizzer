<p>Cheilanthes jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes jamaicensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
