                    <h1>Cassebeera ternifolia</h1>
<p>Cassebeera ternifolia, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic tree native to tropical coastal regions.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which allow it to absorb oxygen from the air in waterlogged soils. The plant thrives in brackish and saltwater environments, playing a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. Its leaves are alternate and elliptical, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cassebeera ternifolia is also notable for its small, red, fleshy fruits that provide food for various wildlife species.</p>
