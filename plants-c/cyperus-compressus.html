                <h1>Cyperus compressus</h1>
<p>Cyperus compressus, commonly known as spike rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes, pond edges, and disturbed soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms.</p>
<p>Cyperus compressus is widely distributed across temperate and tropical regions worldwide.</p>
