                    <h1>Cyperus sanguinolentus f. rubromarginatus</h1>
<p>Cyperus sanguinolentus f. rubromarginatus, commonly known as the red-margin sedgeland, is a variant of the species Cyperus sanguinolentus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red margins on the leaves, which distinguish it from the typical green foliage of the base plant. This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants.</p>
<p>The red-margin feature is likely due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments, which can be influenced by environmental factors such as light exposure and soil pH.</p>
