                    <h1>Cuscuta foetida</h1>
<p>Cuscuta foetida, commonly known as the stinking cuscuta, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, attaching itself with specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has thin, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. It is often found growing on weeds, shrubs, and other plants in various habitats.</p>
<p>Its distinctive odor, which is unpleasant to humans, is thought to aid in attracting pollinators.</p>
