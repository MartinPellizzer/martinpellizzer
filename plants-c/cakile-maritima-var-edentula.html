                    <h1>Cakile maritima var. edentula</h1>
<p>Cakile maritima var. edentula, commonly known as the sea rocket, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It possesses small, pinnately compound leaves that help reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by pods that disperse its seeds by wind. Its root system is robust, allowing it to anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh maritime climates.</p>
