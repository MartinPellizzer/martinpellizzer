                    <h1>Coryphantha vivipara var. kaibabensis</h1>
<p>Coryphantha vivipara var. kaibabensis, commonly known as the Kaibab prickly pear, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines and small, fleshy leaves that are often reduced to tubercles. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers, which are typically followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions through its deep root system.</p>
<p>The variety is distinguished by its geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the typical form of Coryphantha vivipara.</p>
