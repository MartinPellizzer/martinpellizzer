                    <h1>Crassula illichiana</h1>
<p>Crassula illichiana, commonly known as the Ice Plant or Frost Plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in arid conditions makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
