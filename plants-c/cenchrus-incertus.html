                    <h1>Cenchrus incertus</h1>
<p>Cenchrus incertus, commonly known as the uncertain grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray sheen. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in hard, spiky structures called lemma and palea, which aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Cenchrus incertus is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a common weed in disturbed environments.</p>
