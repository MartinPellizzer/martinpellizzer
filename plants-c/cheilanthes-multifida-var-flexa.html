                    <h1>Cheilanthes multifida var. flexa</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes multifida var. flexa, commonly known as the flexed rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and rocky environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and deeply divided, pinnatifid leaves that give it a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on cliffs, rock faces, and in dry, sunny habitats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
