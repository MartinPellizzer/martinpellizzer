                    <h1>Cochlidium punctatum</h1>
<p>Cochlidium punctatum, commonly known as the spotted dwarf snail, is a small terrestrial gastropod belonging to the family Bradybaenidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark brown shell with distinct yellow or white spots, which provide camouflage in its natural habitat. This species is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as under leaf litter or in rocky crevices. Its diet consists mainly of decaying plant matter and fungi, contributing to nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and cryptic appearance, it is often overlooked but plays a vital role in its ecological niche.</p>
