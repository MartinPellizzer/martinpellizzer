                    <h1>Casuarina lateriflora</h1>
<p>Casuarina lateriflora, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of Australia and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, needle-like foliage and its ability to thrive in sandy, saline soils. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its seeds are encased in woody cones, which release them when the cones dry and split open.</p>
<p>Casuarina lateriflora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
