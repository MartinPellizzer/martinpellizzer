<p>Cuscuta epithymum var. microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thin, thread-like stems that缠绕 around its host. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are tiny and can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants.</p>
