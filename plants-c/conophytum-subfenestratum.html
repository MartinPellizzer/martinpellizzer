                    <h1>Conophytum subfenestratum</h1>
<p>Conophytum subfenestratum, commonly known as the "window plant," is a succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed leaves that are often adorned with translucent windows or holes, which help reduce water loss. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
