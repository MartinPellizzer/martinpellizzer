                    <h1>Combretum nervosum</h1>
<p>Combretum nervosum, commonly known as the narrow-veined combretum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves with prominent, parallel veins. The plant produces small, pale yellow to green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Combretum nervosum is often found in moist, well-drained soils in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
