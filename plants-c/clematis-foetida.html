                    <h1>Clematis foetida</h1>
<p>Clematis foetida, commonly known as the stinking clematis, is a climbing vine native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that range from white to pale blue. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil with partial to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Clematis foetida is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and can grow up to 10 meters in length.</p>
