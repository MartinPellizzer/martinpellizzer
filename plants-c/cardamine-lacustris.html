<p>Cardamine lacustris, commonly known as water shield, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant found in shallow freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It has delicate, floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped or rounded with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Cardamine lacustris is often found in ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams.</p>
