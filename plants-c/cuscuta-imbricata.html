                    <h1>Cuscuta imbricata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta imbricata, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks leaves, chlorophyll, and roots.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to host plants using specialized haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas easily.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
