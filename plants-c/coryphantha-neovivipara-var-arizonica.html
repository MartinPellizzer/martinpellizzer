                    <h1>Coryphantha neovivipara var. arizonica</h1>
<p>Coryphantha neovivipara var. arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona live-bearing cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green and covered in white to yellow spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. It is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its stems to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly noted for its viviparous reproduction, where seeds are produced on the plant's surface and can germinate before falling to the ground.</p>
