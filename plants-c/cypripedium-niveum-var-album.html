                    <h1>Cypripedium niveum var. album</h1>
<p>Cypripedium niveum var. album, commonly known as the white lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a unique adaptation for pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi that aid in nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and it produces a single flower per stem, making it a prized species among orchid enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
