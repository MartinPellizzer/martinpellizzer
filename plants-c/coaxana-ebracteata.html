                    <h1>Coaxana ebracteata</h1>
<p>Coaxana ebracteata, commonly known as the slender rock cress, is a small flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with simple, linear leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its reproductive structures are relatively simple, with flowers that lack bracts, a feature reflected in its scientific name.</p>
<p>Coaxana ebracteata plays a minor but important role in its ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
