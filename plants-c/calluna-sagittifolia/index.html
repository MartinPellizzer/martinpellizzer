                            <h1>Calluna Sagittifolia</h1>
<p>Calluna sagittifolia is a rare and striking evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is known for its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and clusters of small, bell-like flowers that bloom in late spring. This plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Its unique appearance makes it a prized addition to botanical gardens and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss, Calluna sagittifolia is now considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for continued protection and study.</p>
