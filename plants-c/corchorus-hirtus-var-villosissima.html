<p>Corchorus hirtus var. villosissima, commonly known as the hairy dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered in dense, soft hairs. The leaves are large, heart-shaped, and also hairy, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming from June to August.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in moist soils along riverbanks, wet meadows, and disturbed sites, and is valued for its historical use in textile production.</p>
