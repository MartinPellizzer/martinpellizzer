<p>Corallorhiza striata f. flavida, commonly known as the yellow coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients, making it a hemiparasitic plant. The species features a slender, often branched stem covered in small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are typically pink or yellow, with a tubular shape and spurred petals.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and forest floors.</p>
