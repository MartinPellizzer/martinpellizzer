<p>Cephaelis tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui cephaelis, is a flowering plant native to the tepuis of South America, particularly in Venezuela and Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its striking, often showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of the tepuis. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, while its flowers are often pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cephaelis tepuiensis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
