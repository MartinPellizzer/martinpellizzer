                    <h1>Clypeola jonthlaspi var. ambigua</h1>
<p>Clypeola jonthlaspi var. ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous shield-leaf, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive shield-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. This variant is typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, further research is needed to fully understand its botanical characteristics and ecological role.</p>
