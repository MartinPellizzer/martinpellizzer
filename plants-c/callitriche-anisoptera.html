<p>Callitriche anisoptera, commonly known as the narrowleaf water starwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Callitrichaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, floating or submersed stems with opposite, linear leaves that are often slightly curled. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found in nutrient-rich waters.</p>
