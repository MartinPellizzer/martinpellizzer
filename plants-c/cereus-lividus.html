                    <h1>Cereus lividus</h1>
<p>Cereus lividus, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a stem succulent characterized by its spiny, ribbed structure and ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, a feature common in many cacti adapted to desert environments. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived plant.</p>
<p>Cereus lividus is well-suited for cultivation in dry climates with minimal water requirements.</p>
