<p>Cousinia abbreviata, commonly known as the short-stemmed cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss, while its flowers bloom in shades of yellow to orange.</p>
<p>Cousinia abbreviata is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens.</p>
