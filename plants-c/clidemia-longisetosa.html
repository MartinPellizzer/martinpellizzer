<p>Clidemia longisetosa, commonly known as the long-hair mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant attaches itself to host trees, drawing water and nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds, which can germinate on the bark of suitable host trees.</p>
<p>Clidemia longisetosa plays a role in local ecosystems by influencing forest structure and providing food for various insects and birds.</p>
