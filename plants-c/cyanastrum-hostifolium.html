                    <h1>Cyanastrum hostifolium</h1>
<p>Cyanastrum hostifolium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves that are typically green with a faint blue or purple hue. The plant produces small, delicate white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, often in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
