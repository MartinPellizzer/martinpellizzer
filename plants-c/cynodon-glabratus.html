                    <h1>Cynodon glabratus</h1>
<p>Cynodon glabratus, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale blue or purple flowers. It is widely used for forage in livestock grazing due to its high nutritional value and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>However, it has also become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering ecosystem dynamics.</p>
