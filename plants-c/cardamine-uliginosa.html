                    <h1>Cardamine uliginosa</h1>
<p>Cardamine uliginosa, commonly known as bog buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has a basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Cardamine uliginosa plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity by providing nectar for early pollinators.</p>
