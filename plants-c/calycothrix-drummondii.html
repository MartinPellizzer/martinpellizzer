<p>Calycothrix drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's ghostflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the arid regions of Southwestern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
