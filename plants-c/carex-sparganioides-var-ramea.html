                    <h1>Carex sparganioides var. ramea</h1>
<p>Carex sparganioides var. ramea, commonly known as the slender bulblet sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and small, clustered spikelets. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense mats that help stabilize shoreline areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually inconspicuous, with male and female flowers occurring on separate spikelets.</p>
