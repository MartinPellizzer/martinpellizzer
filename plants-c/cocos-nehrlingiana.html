                    <h1>Cocos nehrlingiana</h1>
<p>Cocos nehrlingiana, commonly known as the Nehrling's coconut, is a rare and unique species within the palm family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, hairy fruits that contain a single coconut-like seed, though it is not closely related to the common coconut. It is native to the Andes Mountains in South America, specifically in regions of Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
