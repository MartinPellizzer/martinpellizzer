<p>Conopodium denudatum, commonly known as the naked bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, leafless stems and small, bladder-like structures that aid in capturing small aquatic organisms.

Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-yellow in color, and it reproduces both sexually and vegetatively.</p>
<p>Conopodium denudatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microscopic life.</p>
