<p>Cryptantha alpicola, commonly known as the alpine cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cold, dry conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cryptantha alpicola is known for its delicate, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a splash of color to alpine meadows.</p>
