                    <h1>Corrigiola vulcanica</h1>
<p>Corrigiola vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic sandplant, is a rare flowering plant adapted to extreme environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-poor, volcanic soils and is typically found in coastal or arid regions. The plant has small, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a unique example of plant adaptation to volcanic landscapes.</p>
