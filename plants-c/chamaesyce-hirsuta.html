                    <h1>Chamaesyce hirsuta</h1>
<p>Chamaesyce hirsuta, commonly known as hairy false nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy, giving it its common name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>Chamaesyce hirsuta is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance, but it lacks the stinging hairs found on true nettles.</p>
