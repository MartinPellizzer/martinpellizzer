                    <h1>Carex cespitosa f. acutiuscula</h1>
<p>Carex cespitosa f. acutiuscula, commonly known as the sharp-pointed sedge, is a variant of the common sedges, characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical flower spikes.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream sides. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense clumps. Its leaves are usually sharp and pointed, giving it its common name, and they are often covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowering stems bear small, clustered flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
