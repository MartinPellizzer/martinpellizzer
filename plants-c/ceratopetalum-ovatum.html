<p>Ceratopetalum ovatum, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a shrub native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cariandraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, leathery, and arranged in a dense, compact form, which helps it conserve water in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Ceratopetalum ovatum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
