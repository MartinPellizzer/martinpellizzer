                    <h1>Ctenopterella denticulata</h1>
<p>Ctenopterella denticulata, commonly known as the toothed fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive toothed margin that gives the plant its common name.</p>
