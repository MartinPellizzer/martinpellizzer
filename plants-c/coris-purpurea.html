                    <h1>Coris purpurea</h1>
<p>Coris purpurea, commonly known as the purple coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist forest environments, often growing on the trunks of trees. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients, making it a unique example of a saprophytic orchid. Its striking purple flowers bloom in late spring, adding a vibrant touch to the woodland understory.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
