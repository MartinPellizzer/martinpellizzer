                    <h1>Cypripedium isabelianum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium isabelianum, commonly known as the Isabel's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a deep pink or purple pouch-like structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments and has a thick, fleshy rhizome that helps it survive in its native habitat. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is known for its slow growth and long dormancy period.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several regions.</p>
