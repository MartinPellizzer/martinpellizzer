                    <h1>Cheilanthes hirta var. hyaloglandulosa</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes hirta var. hyaloglandulosa, commonly known as the silver fringed rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The fronds are typically gray-green with a dense covering of fine, silvery hairs, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found growing on limestone or sandstone outcrops.</p>
