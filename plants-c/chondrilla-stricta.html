<p>Chondrilla stricta, commonly known as the rigid goatweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with woody stems that become more rigid with age. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Chondrilla stricta produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
