<p>Crepidium atrosanguineum, commonly known as the black blood orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple to blackish stems and leaves, which are often covered in a fine, hairy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in many parts of its range.</p>
