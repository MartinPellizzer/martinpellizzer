<p>It has bright orange-red bracts that resemble paintbrushes, which are used to attract pollinators. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures, relying on its host plants for nutrients. It typically grows in open, sunny areas such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe.</p>
<p>Its unique relationship with host plants and its striking floral display make it an important component of its ecosystem.</p>
