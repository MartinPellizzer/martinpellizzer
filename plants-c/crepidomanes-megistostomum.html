                    <h1>Crepidomanes megistostomum</h1>
<p>Crepidomanes megistostomum, commonly known as the large-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in rocky and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Crepidomanes megistostomum plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small insects and animals in its native range.</p>
