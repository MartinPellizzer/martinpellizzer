                    <h1>Cestrum grandistipulatum var. exstipulatum</h1>
<p>Cestrum grandistipulatum var. exstipulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, berry-like seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and toxic properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires caution.</p>
