                    <h1>Caralluma pruinosa</h1>
<p>Caralluma pruinosa, commonly known as the Prickly Apple or Desert Cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a branching structure with thick, fleshy stems covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the dry season, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Caralluma pruinosa is adapted to store water in its stems, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
