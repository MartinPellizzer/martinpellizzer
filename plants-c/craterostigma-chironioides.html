                    <h1>Craterostigma chironioides</h1>
<p>Craterostigma chironioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock cress, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsules containing numerous tiny seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a capacity to enter dormancy during dry periods.</p>
<p>Craterostigma chironioides is also noted for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals in its tissues.</p>
