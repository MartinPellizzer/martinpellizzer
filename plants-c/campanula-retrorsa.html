                    <h1>Campanula retrorsa</h1>
<p>Campanula retrorsa, commonly known as the backward bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that open in the morning and close in the afternoon. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
