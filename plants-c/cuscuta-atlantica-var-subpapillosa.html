                    <h1>Cuscuta atlantica var. subpapillosa</h1>
<p>Cuscuta atlantica var. subpapillosa, commonly known as the Atlantic dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation.</p>
