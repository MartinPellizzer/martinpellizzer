                    <h1>Cuscuta racemosa var. racemosa</h1>
<p>Cuscuta racemosa var. racemosa, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a raceme, and its seeds are typically dispersed by wind or animals. The plant's slender, thread-like stems can缠绕 (twine) around host plants, forming a dense network. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, with germination occurring after the host plant has established.</p>
