                    <h1>Carduus glaber</h1>
<p>Carduus glaber, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to violet flowering heads, which contain both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in dry, disturbed soils. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which contribute to its rough texture.</p>
<p>Carduus glaber is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
