<p>Cypripedium formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan lady's slipper, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, showy pinkish-white flowers with a large, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, and it produces a single flower per stem during the spring season.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region.</p>
