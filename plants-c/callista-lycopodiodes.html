<p>Callista lycopodiodes, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of small, evergreen shrub native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that form a compact, mat-like growth. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
