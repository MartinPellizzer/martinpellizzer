The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, highlighting its ecological niche within its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
