                    <h1>Cheiropleuria integrifolia</h1>
<p>Cheiropleuria integrifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as dipterocars, through its specialized roots called haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically broad and ovate, with a smooth margin, and it produces small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant relies on birds for seed dispersal, as its berries are consumed and excreted in new locations.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
