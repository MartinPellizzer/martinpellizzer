<p>Crassula loriformis, commonly known as the "Lizard's Tail" or "Woolly Crassula," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the warmer months. It is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
