                    <h1>Carex banatica</h1>
<p>Carex banatica, commonly known as the Banat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
<p>Carex banatica is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its aesthetic appeal in wetland gardens.</p>
