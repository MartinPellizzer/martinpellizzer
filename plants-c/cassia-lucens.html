<p>Cassia lucens, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, drooping clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into many small leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Cassia lucens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>
