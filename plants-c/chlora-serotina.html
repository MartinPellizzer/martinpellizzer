<p>Chlora serotina, commonly known as the late blooming chlora, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, which features a waxy surface to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom late in the growing season, typically in late autumn. Its botanical classification places it within the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chlora serotina is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
