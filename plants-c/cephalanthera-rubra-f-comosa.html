                    <h1>Cephalanthera rubra f. comosa</h1>
<p>Cephalanthera rubra f. comosa, commonly known as the hairy red helleborine, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and its striking red and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, relying instead on a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It thrives in shaded, moist woodland environments, often growing in rich, loamy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in many regions.</p>
