<p>Cystochilum candidum, commonly known as the white-stemmed marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet, marshy habitats and is characterized by its slender, white or pale green stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose spike, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged soil, and it is often found in association with other wetland flora.</p>
<p>Cystochilum candidum is relatively rare and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive.</p>
