                    <h1>Cacosmia rugosa var. nivea</h1>
<p>Cacosmia rugosa var. nivea, commonly known as the white-veined cacosmia, is a striking ornamental plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are prominently veined with a silvery-white color, creating a striking contrast against the dark green foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which are not the primary ornamental feature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique leaf patterns, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
