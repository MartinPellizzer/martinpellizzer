<p>Cuviera wernhamii, commonly known as the Wernham's cuviera, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and requires well-drained soil to thrive. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cuviera wernhamii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
