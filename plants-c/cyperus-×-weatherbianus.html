                    <h1>Cyperus × weatherbianus</h1>
<p>Cyperus × weatherbianus, commonly known as the hybrid flatsedge, is a sterile hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Cyperus rotundus and Cyperus serpyllifolius.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. The plant typically forms dense mats on wet soils, often in disturbed areas or along waterways. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are usually hidden beneath the leaves, making it difficult to identify without careful examination.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it does not produce viable seeds and is often considered a weed in agricultural and aquatic environments.</p>
