                    <h1>Cheilanthes glandulosa</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features lance-shaped, leathery fronds with a distinctive glandular coating on the underside, which helps reduce water loss. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes glandulosa is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy plant in xerophytic environments.</p>
