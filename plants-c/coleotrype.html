<p>Coleotrype, commonly known as the coral fungus, is a type of fungus that belongs to the family Trametes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branching, coral-like structure and is typically found on dead wood in forested areas. The fruiting bodies are usually pale to reddish in color and can range in size from small to several inches in diameter. Coleotrype species are saprophytic, meaning they decompose dead organic matter, contributing to nutrient cycling in ecosystems.</p>
<p>They are often used in traditional medicine and have been studied for their potential bioactive compounds.</p>
