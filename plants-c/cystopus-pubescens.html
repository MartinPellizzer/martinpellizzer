<p>Cystopus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, inflated bladders that aid in capturing prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the bladders are its primary means of nutrient acquisition.</p>
<p>Cystopus pubescens is a carnivorous plant that uses its specialized bladders to trap and digest small aquatic organisms.</p>
