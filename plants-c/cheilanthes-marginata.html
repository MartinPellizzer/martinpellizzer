                    <h1>Cheilanthes marginata</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes marginata, commonly known as the marginate rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dark green, leathery fronds with serrated margins. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in crevices, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes marginata is drought-tolerant and adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
