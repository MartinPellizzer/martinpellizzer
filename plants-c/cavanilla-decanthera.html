                    <h1>Cavanilla decanthera</h1>
<p>Cavanilla decanthera, commonly known as the desert cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a succulent plant characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Cavanilla decanthera is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in desert ecosystems.</p>
