                    <h1>Castanea vesca var. subalpina</h1>
<p>Castanea vesca var. subalpina, commonly known as the alpine horse chestnut, is a rare variant of the horse chestnut tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smaller, spiny fruits and palmately lobed leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the standard species. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in mountainous regions of Europe. Its flowers are white and clustered in panicles, and it produces edible nuts enclosed in a prickly husk.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically rare species.</p>
