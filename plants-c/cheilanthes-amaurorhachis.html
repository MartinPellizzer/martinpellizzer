<p>Cheilanthes amaurorhachis, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. The plant has a compact rosette of leathery, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of pale, waxy bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its fronds are usually short and broad, with a shield-like shape that helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a characteristic feature of ferns.</p>
