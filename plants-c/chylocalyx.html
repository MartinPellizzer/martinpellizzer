<p>Chylocalyx, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a compact growth habit and often forms dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Chylocalyx is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
