<p>Cuscuta gymnocarpa subsp.</p>
<p>deflexa, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment. It is characterized by its yellow or orange, thread-like stems that coil around its hosts, typically members of the legume family.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and relies on wind for pollination. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that consume the fruits of its host plants.</p>
<p>This species is native to parts of Asia and is often found in dry, disturbed habitats.</p>
