                    <h1>Caryota macrantha</h1>
<p>Caryota macrantha, commonly known as the giant palm or giant fishtail palm, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that eventually develop into edible, fleshy fruits. Its robust root system allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils, often in swampy or wetland environments.</p>
<p>Caryota macrantha is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
