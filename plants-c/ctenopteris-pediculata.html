<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a distinctive crown of fiddleheads, which are the young, coiled fronds that unfurl as the plant matures. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, providing structural support and enabling the plant to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Ctenopteris pediculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
