                    <h1>Chamaegastrodia poilanei</h1>
<p>Chamaegastrodia poilanei, commonly known as the Poilane's tuckahoe, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, pale green to yellow flowers with a distinct lip. The plant thrives in shaded, moist forest understories and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a complex life cycle involving a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
