<p>Cerastium diffusum subsp.</p>
<p>subtetrandrum, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May.</p>
<p>The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves and a mat-forming growth habit, allowing it to spread across rocky or disturbed soils. It is often found in grassy areas, along pathways, and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a common sight in temperate regions, though it is generally not considered invasive.</p>
