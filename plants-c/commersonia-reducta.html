<p>Commersonia reducta, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Viscaraceae family.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in south-eastern Australia. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white, fleshy berries that contain seeds. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for native birds and insects.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plant over time.</p>
