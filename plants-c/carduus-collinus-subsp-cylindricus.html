<p>Carduus collinus subsp.</p>
<p>cylindricus, commonly known as the cylindrical thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, woolly leaves that are typically gray-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single, prominent head, which is surrounded by several rows of bracts. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range.</p>
