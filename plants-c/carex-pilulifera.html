<p>Carex pilulifera, commonly known as the pill-like sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Carex pilulifera plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
