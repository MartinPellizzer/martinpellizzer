<p>Cycnoches dianae, commonly known as the Dianae's cycnoches, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers that display a blend of white and purple hues. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually elongated and glossy, adapting to low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cycnoches dianae is considered a conservation concern.</p>
