                    <h1>Cyclosorus exsculptus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus exsculptus, commonly known as the sculptured water fern, is a rare aquatic fern found in specific freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged, with a distinctive, sculpted appearance on the undersides. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still water with rich organic substrates, often in shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
