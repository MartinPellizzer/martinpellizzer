<p>Cleistocactus fieldianus, commonly known as the Field's close-cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white or grayish hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that open only at night, a trait known as nocturnal anthesis. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and growth habits, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
