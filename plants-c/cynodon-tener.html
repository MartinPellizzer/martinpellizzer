                    <h1>Cynodon tener</h1>
<p>Cynodon tener, commonly known as the dwarf buffalo grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense, mat-like growth habit, which makes it highly drought-tolerant. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly and form a dense turf.</p>
<p>Cynodon tener is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a low-maintenance ground cover.</p>
