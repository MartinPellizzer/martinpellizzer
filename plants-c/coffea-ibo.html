<p>Coffea ibo, commonly known as the Ibo coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the humid lowland forests of western Africa, particularly Nigeria. The plant produces small, oval-shaped berries that contain two seeds used for coffee production. It thrives in tropical climates with high rainfall and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and susceptibility to pests, it is considered a rare and endangered coffee species.</p>
