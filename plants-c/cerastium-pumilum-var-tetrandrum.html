<p>Cerastium pumilum var. tetrandrum, commonly known as the mossy chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems.</p>
