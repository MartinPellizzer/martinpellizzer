<p>Chieniopteris kempii, commonly known as the Kentucky buckwheat fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected natural areas.</p>
