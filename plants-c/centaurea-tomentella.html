                    <h1>Centaurea tomentella</h1>
<p>Centaurea tomentella, commonly known as the woolly centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in a dense, spherical cluster, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments.</p>
<p>Centaurea tomentella is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance.</p>
