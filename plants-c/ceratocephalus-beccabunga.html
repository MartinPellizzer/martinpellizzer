<p>Ceratocephalus beccabunga, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a aquatic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically in summer. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of still or slow-moving water bodies.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to nutrient-rich environments and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
