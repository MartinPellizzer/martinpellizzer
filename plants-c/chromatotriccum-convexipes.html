                    <h1>Chromatotriccum convexipes</h1>
<p>Chromatotriccum convexipes, commonly known as the zigzag liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thalloid structure, which consists of a flattened, ribbon-like body covered in tiny, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are borne on the upper surface of the thallus and produce both male and female reproductive organs.</p>
<p>Chromatotriccum convexipes is known for its distinctive zigzag pattern along the margins of its thallus, which aids in its identification.</p>
