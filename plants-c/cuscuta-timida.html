                    <h1>Cuscuta timida</h1>
<p>Cuscuta timida, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves attaching to a host through specialized haustoria. The plant is often found on crops like corn and soybeans, making it a significant agricultural pest. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and even through human activity.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or kill its host, impacting both wild and cultivated plant communities.</p>
