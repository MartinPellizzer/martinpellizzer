<p>Cleoserrata, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that give it a silvery appearance, and its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature, and they contain seeds that are dispersed by animals. Cleoserrata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>It is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas.</p>
