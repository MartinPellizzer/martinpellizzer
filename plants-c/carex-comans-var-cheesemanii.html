                    <h1>Carex comans var. cheesemanii</h1>
<p>Carex comans var. cheesemanii, commonly known as the Cheeseman's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands or streamside habitats. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its slightly broader leaves and more robust growth compared to the typical form of Carex comans.</p>
