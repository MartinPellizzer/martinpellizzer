                    <h1>Codariocalyx motorius</h1>
<p>Codariocalyx motorius, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
