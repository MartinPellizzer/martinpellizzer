                    <h1>Calathea attenuata</h1>
<p>Calathea attenuata, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that often feature intricate patterns and a deep, velvety texture. The leaves exhibit nyctinasty, a behavior where they fold shut at night and open in the morning, resembling prayer. This unique movement is triggered by changes in light and temperature.</p>
<p>Calathea attenuata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
