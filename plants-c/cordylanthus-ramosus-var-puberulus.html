<p>Cordylanthus ramosus var. puberulus, commonly known as the hairy stickseed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its delicate, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to its arid environment, helping to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its fine pubescence, which gives it its common name.</p>
