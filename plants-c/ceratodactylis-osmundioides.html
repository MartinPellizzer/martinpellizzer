<p>Ceratodactylis osmundioides, commonly known as the spiky liverwort, is a unique member of the plant kingdom characterized by its intricate, thalloid structure.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is distinguished by its dense, leaf-like structures that form a cushion-like growth. The plant exhibits a specialized morphology with prominent, spiny projections that provide structural support and aid in water retention. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on bryophyte evolution and ecological adaptation.</p>
