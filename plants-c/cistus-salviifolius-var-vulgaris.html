<p>Cistus salviifolius var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and coastal environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
