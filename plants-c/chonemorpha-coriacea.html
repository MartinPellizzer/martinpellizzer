                    <h1>Chonemorpha coriacea</h1>
<p>Chonemorpha coriacea, commonly known as the rough chondrilla, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, branched stems covered in a thick, rough, bark-like layer. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are small, leathery, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Chonemorpha coriacea is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
