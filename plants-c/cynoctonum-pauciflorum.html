                    <h1>Cynoctonum pauciflorum</h1>
<p>Cynoctonum pauciflorum, commonly known as the rare and elusive pauciflorum cycad, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a tight rosette. The plant produces small, clustered cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones more rounded. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is classified within the order Cycadales and is closely related to other ancient plant groups.</p>
