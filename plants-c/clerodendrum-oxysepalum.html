<p>Clerodendrum oxysepalum, commonly known as the flame of the forest, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which are clustered in panicles. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
