                    <h1>Craterostigma gracile</h1>
<p>Craterostigma gracile, commonly known as the slender rockcress, is a small, perennial herb native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant is distinguished by its narrow, linear leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Craterostigma gracile is also noted for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to tolerate heavy metals in the soil.</p>
