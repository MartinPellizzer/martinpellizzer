<p>Clematis pitcheri var. bigelovii, commonly known as the Bigelov's clematis, is a rare and endemic species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and showy, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
