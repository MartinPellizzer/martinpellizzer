                    <h1>Calopogon barbatus var. multiflorus</h1>
<p>Calopogon barbatus var. multiflorus, commonly known as the swamp pink, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features striking, showy inflorescences composed of multiple pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, club-shaped seed pods that mature in the fall. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions.</p>
