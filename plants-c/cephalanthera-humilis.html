                    <h1>Cephalanthera humilis</h1>
<p>Cephalanthera humilis, commonly known as the Lesser Butterfly Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant with delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a short rhizome and produces a single, spurred flower per stem, which is characteristic of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>Cephalanthera humilis is pollinated primarily by flies and lacks true roots, relying instead on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption.</p>
