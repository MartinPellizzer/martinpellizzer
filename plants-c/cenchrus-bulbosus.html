                    <h1>Cenchrus bulbosus</h1>
<p>Cenchrus bulbosus, commonly known as the bulbous grass or bulbous couch, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and stout, bulbous rhizomes that allow it to form extensive clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its fibrous roots make it highly drought-tolerant and adaptable to poor soils, contributing to its success in arid environments.</p>
<p>Cenchrus bulbosus is often used in landscaping and erosion control due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal.</p>
