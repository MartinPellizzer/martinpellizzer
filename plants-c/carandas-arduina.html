<p>Carandas arduina, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Carandas arduina is now considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
