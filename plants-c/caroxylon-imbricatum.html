                    <h1>Caroxylon imbricatum</h1>
<p>Caroxylon imbricatum, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, enabling it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Caroxylon imbricatum plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for desert wildlife.</p>
