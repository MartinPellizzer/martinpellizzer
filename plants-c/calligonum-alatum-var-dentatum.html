                    <h1>Calligonum alatum var. dentatum</h1>
<p>Calligonum alatum var. dentatum, commonly known as the winged saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, winged stems that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The leaves are small, scale-like, and often covered in a fine layer of salt, which aids in osmoregulation. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This plant is highly drought-tolerant and is often used in ecological restoration projects in saline soils.</p>
