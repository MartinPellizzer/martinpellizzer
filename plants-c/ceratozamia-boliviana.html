                    <h1>Ceratozamia boliviana</h1>
<p>Ceratozamia boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Andean regions of Bolivia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in cloud forest environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Ceratozamia boliviana is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
