                    <h1>Cuscuta gronovii var. curta</h1>
<p>Cuscuta gronovii var. curta, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found on grasses, sedges, and other low-growing vegetation. Its life cycle involves producing seeds that can remain dormant in the soil for many years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural ecosystems.</p>
