                    <h1>Conopholis</h1>
<p>Conopholis, commonly known as the Indian pipe, is a unique plant belonging to the family Onagraceae.</p>
<p>It is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll, giving it its distinctive pale or ghostly appearance. Conopholis grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forests where it attaches to the roots of other plants. Its flowers are small and usually white or greenish, and it produces berries that are edible for some animals.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
