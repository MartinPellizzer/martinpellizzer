                    <h1>Corallorhiza maculata f. immaculata</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza maculata f. immaculata, commonly known as the white twayblade, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces tall, branching stems with showy, white flowers that have a distinctive, intricate pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
