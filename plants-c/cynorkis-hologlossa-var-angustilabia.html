                    <h1>Cynorkis hologlossa var. angustilabia</h1>
<p>Cynorkis hologlossa var. angustilabia, commonly known as the narrow-lipped cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that are dark green and often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
