                    <h1>Chloris canterae var. grandiflora</h1>
<p>Chloris canterae var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, delicate blue or purple flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value comes from its fine texture and color, though it is not typically used for forage.</p>
<p>It is relatively low maintenance and resistant to drought once established.</p>
