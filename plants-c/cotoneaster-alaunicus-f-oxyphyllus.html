                    <h1>Cotoneaster alaunicus f. oxyphyllus</h1>
<p>Cotoneaster alaunicus f. oxyphyllus, commonly known as the alpine cotoneaster, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It is well adapted to cold, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
