                    <h1>Cerastium glomeratum var. brachycarpum</h1>
<p>Cerastium glomeratum var. brachycarpum, commonly known as the dwarf mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered white flowers and hairy, succulent leaves that are characteristic of the Caryophyllaceae family. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ability to form dense mats make it a common ground cover in temperate regions.</p>
<p>The variety brachycarpum is distinguished by its shorter, more compact stems compared to the typical form.</p>
