                    <h1>Chamaedryfolia procridifolia</h1>
<p>Chamaedryfolia procridifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf daphne, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in coastal areas. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>The leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
