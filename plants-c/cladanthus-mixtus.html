<p>Cladanthus mixtus, commonly known as the mixed thornweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with woody stems that become branched and covered in small, sharp thorns. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its drought-resistant nature.</p>
<p>Cladanthus mixtus is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun conditions.</p>
