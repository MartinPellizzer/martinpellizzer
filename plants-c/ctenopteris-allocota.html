                    <h1>Ctenopteris allocota</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris allocota, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea kale, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive, serrated margin. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its coastal habitat. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments near the shoreline.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
