<p>Cyperus laevigatus f. reptans, commonly known as the creeping flatsedge, is a low-growing, rhizomatous perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
