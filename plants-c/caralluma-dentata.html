                    <h1>Caralluma dentata</h1>
<p>Caralluma dentata, commonly known as the dragon's tongue cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Caralluma dentata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
