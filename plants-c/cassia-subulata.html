<p>Cassia subulata, commonly known as the needle cassia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Cassia subulata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
