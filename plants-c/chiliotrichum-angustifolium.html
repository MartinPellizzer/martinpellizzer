<p>Chiliotrichum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and linear, adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Chiliotrichum angustifolium is often found in rocky outcrops and along coastal dunes, where it thrives in full sun and minimal rainfall.</p>
