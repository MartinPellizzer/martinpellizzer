                    <h1>Ceraia lamellifera</h1>
<p>Ceraia lamellifera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, overlapping segments. The plant typically grows in slow-moving or still water, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes help it spread and form dense colonies, which can provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in water filtration and is sometimes used in bioremediation efforts.</p>
