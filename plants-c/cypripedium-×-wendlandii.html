<p>Cypripedium × wendlandii, commonly known as the Wendland's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single flower per stem, usually in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts.</p>
