                    <h1>Cheilanthes paleacea</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes paleacea, commonly known as the pale rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery trichomes. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to low water conditions, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to crevices in rock formations.</p>
<p>The pale rock fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in harsh environments.</p>
