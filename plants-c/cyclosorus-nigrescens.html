<p>Cyclosorus nigrescens, commonly known as the black-stemmed water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to freshwater habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome that helps it spread across the substrate. Its spores are released into the water and germinate into small, heart-shaped gametophytes.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus nigrescens plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
