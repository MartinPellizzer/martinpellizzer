                    <h1>Commiphora myrrha var. molmol</h1>
<p>Commiphora myrrha var. molmol, commonly known as olibanum, is a resin-producing plant native to regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, gum-like resin, which has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and incense. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with smooth, grayish bark and opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape. Its resin, known as myrrh, is harvested by making incisions in the bark, allowing the sap to exude and harden into a fragrant gum.</p>
