<p>Cyclosorus kuliangensis, commonly known as the Kuliang moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort belonging to the family Peltasporaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, branched thallus and small, elliptical leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories or on rocky surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including peristome teeth and calyptra, are well-developed, facilitating spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cyclosorus kuliangensis is considered an important indicator species for assessing ecological health in its native range.</p>
