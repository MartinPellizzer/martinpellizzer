<p>Chondrosea cotyledon, commonly known as the desert bean, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale green cotyledons, which are the first leaves to emerge from the seed. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, hard pods containing one or two seeds.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Chondrosea cotyledon make it well adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments.</p>
