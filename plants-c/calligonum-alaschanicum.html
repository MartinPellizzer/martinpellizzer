<p>Calligonum alaschanicum, commonly known as the Alashan saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in saline soils, making it an important species for stabilizing desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots also aid in preventing soil erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
