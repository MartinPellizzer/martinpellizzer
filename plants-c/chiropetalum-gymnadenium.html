                    <h1>Chiropetalum gymnadenium</h1>
<p>Chiropetalum gymnadenium, commonly known as the red sanders, is a rare and valuable tree native to the dry forests of southern India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly sought after for its fine grain and durability. The plant has a slow growth rate and is known for its unique ability to produce a resinous sap that contributes to its high economic value. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a tropical to subtropical climate with seasonal rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as an endangered species.</p>
