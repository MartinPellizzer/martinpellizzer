                    <h1>Cheirostylis inabae</h1>
<p>Cheirostylis inabae, commonly known as the Inabae's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spike that bears small, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
