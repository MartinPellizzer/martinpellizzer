<p>Cardamine nipponica var. happoensis, commonly known as the Happo watercress, is a rare and delicate aquatic plant native to Japan.</p>
<p>It typically grows in cool, shaded streams and mountain springs, where it thrives in flowing water with moderate currents. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or partially emergent. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
