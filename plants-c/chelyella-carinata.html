                    <h1>Chelyella carinata</h1>
<p>Chelyella carinata, commonly known as the ridge-leaf fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed fronds that give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving water and prefers muddy or sandy substrates. Its rhizomes are often buried in the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Chelyella carinata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling.</p>
