                    <h1>Calvaria globosa</h1>
<p>Calvaria globosa, commonly known as the globe sphaerocarp, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Sphaerocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical, spore-producing structures called sphaerocarps, which are typically found in freshwater environments. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of a simple, branching structure that floats on the water's surface. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, with each sphaerocarp containing numerous spores that are released into the water when mature.</p>
<p>Calvaria globosa is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it plays a minor role in the ecosystem.</p>
