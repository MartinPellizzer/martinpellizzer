<p>Carduus horridus, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a rough, prickly texture, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically in traditional medicine.</p>
