<p>Cakile maritima subsp.</p>
<p>islandica, commonly known as the island sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the North Atlantic. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by triangular, pod-like fruits that disperse seeds by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along rocky shores.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh maritime conditions, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
