<p>Chaetochloa gigantea var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features dense, tufted growth with long, slender leaves covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces panicles of small, greenish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in wetland or marshy environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its hairy foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps in identifying it from other similar grasses.</p>
