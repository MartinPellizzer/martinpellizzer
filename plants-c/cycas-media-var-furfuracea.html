                    <h1>Cycas media var. furfuracea</h1>
<p>Cycas media var. furfuracea, commonly known as the woolly cycad, is a slow-growing, cycad species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, trunk-like stem and large, pinnate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, requiring well-drained soil and minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
