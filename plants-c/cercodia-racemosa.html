                    <h1>Cercodia racemosa</h1>
<p>Cercodia racemosa, commonly known as the clustered broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which are often inconspicuous. Its root system consists of haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the roots of host plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, influencing the growth and distribution of its host species.</p>
