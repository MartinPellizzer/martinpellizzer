                    <h1>Cuscuta peduncularis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta peduncularis, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive appearance with its yellow, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize a wide range of host species. It is often found in agricultural fields and disturbed areas, where it can cause significant damage to crops.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it has a complex relationship with its host, affecting both the host's growth and the ecosystem dynamics.</p>
