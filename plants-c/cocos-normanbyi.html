                    <h1>Cocos normanbyi</h1>
<p>Cocos normanbyi, commonly known as the Normanby's coconut, is a rare and endangered species native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small palm tree that typically grows to a height of around 5 meters, with a slender trunk and feathery leaves. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single coconut-like seed, which is encased in a fibrous husk. Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it an important subject of study in tropical botany.</p>
