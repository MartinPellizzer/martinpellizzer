                    <h1>Crassula abyssinica</h1>
<p>Crassula abyssinica, commonly known as the African snowball, is a succulent plant native to Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It features compact, rounded rosettes of fleshy, silver-green leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and ease of care, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
