The plant has silver-gray foliage and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It produces small, tough seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across rocky and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Cousinia chrysacantha is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
