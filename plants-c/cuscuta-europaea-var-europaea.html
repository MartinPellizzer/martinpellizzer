                    <h1>Cuscuta europaea var. europaea</h1>
<p>Cuscuta europaea var. europaea, commonly known as the European dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host to extract water and nutrients. The plant is often found growing on crops such as wheat, barley, and legumes, making it a significant agricultural pest. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to spread widely across different regions.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in certain ecosystems by influencing host plant populations and providing food for some insect species.</p>
