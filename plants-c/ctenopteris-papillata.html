                    <h1>Ctenopteris papillata</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris papillata, commonly known as the hairy sea palm, is a species of feather moss found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and the presence of small, papillate (bump-like) structures on its leaves. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils along shorelines and is often found in tidal zones. Its fronds are typically short and broad, with a waxy coating that helps protect it from salt spray.</p>
<p>Ctenopteris papillata plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
