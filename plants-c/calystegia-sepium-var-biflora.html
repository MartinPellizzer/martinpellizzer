<p>Calystegia sepium var. biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its twining stems that climb or trail along the ground. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are heart-shaped and alternate along the stems, while its roots are fibrous and can form extensive underground networks.</p>
<p>This species is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
