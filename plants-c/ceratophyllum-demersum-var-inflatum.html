                    <h1>Ceratophyllum demersum var. inflatum</h1>
<p>Ceratophyllum demersum var. inflatum, commonly known as the inflated water-chestnut, is a submerged aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, rounded leaves that often appear inflated, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that float on the water surface, followed by dark, waxy fruits that disperse via water. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it can become invasive in some regions.</p>
