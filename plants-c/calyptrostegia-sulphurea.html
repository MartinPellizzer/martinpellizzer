                    <h1>Calyptrostegia sulphurea</h1>
<p>Calyptrostegia sulphurea, commonly known as the golden liverwort, is a species of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Calyptrogeneae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a thin layer of protective wax, which helps it retain moisture. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are borne on short stalks and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Calyptrostegia sulphurea plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
