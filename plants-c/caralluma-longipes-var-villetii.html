                    <h1>Caralluma longipes var. villetii</h1>
<p>Caralluma longipes var. villetii, commonly known as the Spiny Nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other Caralluma species, sharing similar adaptations to extreme climates.</p>
