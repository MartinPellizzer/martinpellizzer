                    <h1>Cuscuta hyalina var. nubiana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta hyalina var. nubiana, commonly known as the silver dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it thrives in dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and native vegetation.</p>
