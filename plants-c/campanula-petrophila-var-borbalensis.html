<p>Campanula petrophila var. borbalensis, commonly known as the Borb√°len campanula, is a rare and endemic species native to the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky and limestone-rich soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
