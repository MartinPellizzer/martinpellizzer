                    <h1>Celtis littoralis</h1>
<p>Celtis littoralis, commonly known as the coastela or coastal elm, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows along coastal areas and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The tree has a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in early spring, followed by small, oval fruits that are edible for some bird species.</p>
<p>Celtis littoralis is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in riparian zones.</p>
