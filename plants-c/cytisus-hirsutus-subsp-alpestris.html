<p>Cytisus hirsutus subsp.</p>
<p>alpestris, commonly known as the alpine broom, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The leaves are small, trifoliate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
