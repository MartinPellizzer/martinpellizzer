<p>Clidemia pusilliflora, commonly known as the small-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its succulent, evergreen foliage and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant attaches itself to host trees, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. Its leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with a glossy surface.</p>
<p>Clidemia pusilliflora is often found in moist, shaded forest understories, contributing to the ecological complexity of its habitat.</p>
