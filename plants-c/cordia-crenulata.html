                    <h1>Cordia crenulata</h1>
<p>Cordia crenulata, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and opposite, ovate leaves with wavy margins. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often forming dense thickets in mangrove ecosystems.</p>
<p>Cordia crenulata plays a vital role in coastal stabilization and provides habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
