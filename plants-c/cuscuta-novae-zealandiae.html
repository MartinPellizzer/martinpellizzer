                    <h1>Cuscuta novae-zealandiae</h1>
<p>Cuscuta novae-zealandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true leaves, stems, and roots.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to host plants through specialized haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on native New Zealand flora such as ferns and shrubs. It is an annual species that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
