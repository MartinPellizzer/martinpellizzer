                    <h1>Chamaesyce serrula</h1>
<p>Chamaesyce serrula, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry fields.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature, it is considered a characteristic species of its native habitat.</p>
