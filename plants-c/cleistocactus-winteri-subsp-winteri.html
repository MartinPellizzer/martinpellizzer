<p>Cleistocactus winteri subsp.</p>
<p>winteri, commonly known as the Winter's cleistocactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that protect it from intense sunlight and cold temperatures.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, which is unusual for cacti. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts for its ornamental value.</p>
