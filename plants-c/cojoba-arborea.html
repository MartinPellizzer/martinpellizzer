                    <h1>Cojoba arborea</h1>
<p>Cojoba arborea, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant has a deep root system that filters out salt from the water it absorbs, allowing it to thrive in brackish or saltwater conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by fruit that contains a single, smooth, white seed.</p>
<p>Cojoba arborea plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
