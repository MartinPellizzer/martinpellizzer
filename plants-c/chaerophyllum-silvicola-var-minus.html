                    <h1>Chaerophyllum silvicola var. minus</h1>
<p>Chaerophyllum silvicola var. minus, commonly known as the lesser wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist woodland environments, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring. Its foliage is often covered in fine, stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Chaerophyllum silvicola.</p>
