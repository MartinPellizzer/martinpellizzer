<p>Cyclosorus costularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, with a distinctive waxy coating that aids in water retention. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-yellow, and clustered in dense, branching inflorescences.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus costularis plays a role in stabilizing water bodies and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
