                    <h1>Ceterach cordatum var. subbipinnatum</h1>
<p>Ceterach cordatum var. subbipinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea hakea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in exposed coastal environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in spikes and are adapted for pollination by wind or insects.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its resilience to salt spray and strong winds, making it well-suited to harsh coastal habitats.</p>
