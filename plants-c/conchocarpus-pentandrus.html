<p>Conchocarpus pentandrus, commonly known as the red mangrove or *Rhizophora stylosa*, is a species of mangrove tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red, knobby fruits that contain a single seed, which is adapted for dispersal by water. The plant thrives in brackish water environments and has specialized root systems that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Conchocarpus pentandrus plays a vital role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
