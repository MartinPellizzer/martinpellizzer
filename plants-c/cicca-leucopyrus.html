                    <h1>Cicca leucopyrus</h1>
<p>Cicca leucopyrus, commonly known as the white-leafed cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a waxy, white coating. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in tropical climates with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range.</p>
