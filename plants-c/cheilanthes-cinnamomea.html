<p>Cheilanthes cinnamomea, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant has a distinctive, creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes cinnamomea thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and rocky areas.</p>
