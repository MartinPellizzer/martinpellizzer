<p>Chamaepeuce × sprengeri, commonly known as the hybrid boxwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact foliage with small, oval, dark green leaves that remain throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and evergreen appearance, it is often used as a foundation plant or hedge.</p>
