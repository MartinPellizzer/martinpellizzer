                    <h1>Cocculus brachystachyus</h1>
<p>Cocculus brachystachyus, commonly known as the short-stalked devil's backbone, is a climbing plant native to parts of Africa and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, twisting stems and palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by kidney-shaped, spiny fruits. Its seeds are enclosed in these fruits and are often used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
