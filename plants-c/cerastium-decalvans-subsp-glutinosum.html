<p>Cerastium decalvans subsp.</p>
<p>glutinosum, commonly known as sticky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>The plant features prostrate stems covered with glandular hairs that produce a sticky secretion, giving it its common name. Its small, white or pinkish flowers appear in clusters, and the leaves are usually linear and covered with a fine, waxy coating.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience.</p>
