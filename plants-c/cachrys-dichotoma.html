<p>Cachrys dichotoma, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant features small, alternate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing insulation against freezing temperatures. Its flowers are clustered in racemes and are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>Cachrys dichotoma plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky and barren habitats.</p>
