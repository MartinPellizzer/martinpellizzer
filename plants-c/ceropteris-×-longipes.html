                    <h1>Ceropteris × longipes</h1>
<p>Ceropteris × longipes, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a hybrid fern species that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Ceropteris fulva and Ceropteris multicaulis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Ceropteris × longipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its aesthetic and ecological benefits in botanical gardens.</p>
