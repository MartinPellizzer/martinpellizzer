                    <h1>Calamus metzianus</h1>
<p>Calamus metzianus, commonly known as the Mexican sweetflag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in dense spikes, typically during the summer months. Calamus metzianus thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with muddy or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its ecological role in wetland ecosystems is significant.</p>
