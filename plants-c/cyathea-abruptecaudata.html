<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in lowland forests. Its rhizome is thick and segmented, supporting the growth of its tall, erect stem.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent, which helps in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
