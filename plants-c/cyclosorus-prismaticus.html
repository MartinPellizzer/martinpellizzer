<p>Cyclosorus prismaticus, commonly known as the prismatic water flea, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and tiny, translucent leaves that give it a glass-like appearance. This plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its unique structure allows it to float on the water's surface while anchoring itself to the substrate.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus prismaticus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
