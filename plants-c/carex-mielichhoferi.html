<p>Carex mielichhoferi, commonly known as the Mielichhofer's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, a common reproductive strategy among sedges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Carex mielichhoferi is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
