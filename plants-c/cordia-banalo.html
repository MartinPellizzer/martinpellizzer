<p>[WRONG START] Codia banalo, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and broad, glossy leaves that help it thrive in saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by fleshy, red berries containing numerous seeds. Its roots form a complex network that stabilizes coastal sediments, playing a vital role in preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Cordia banalo is also valued for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional remedies.</p>
