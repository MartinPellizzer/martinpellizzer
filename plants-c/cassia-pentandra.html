                    <h1>Cassia pentandra</h1>
<p>Cassia pentandra, commonly known as sicklepod, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, curved pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. Cassia pentandra is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid environments due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its seeds are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though the plant is also considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
