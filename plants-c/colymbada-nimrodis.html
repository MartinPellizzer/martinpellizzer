<p>Colymbada nimrodis, commonly known as the Nimrod's water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in still or slow-moving waters, often found in marshy areas and shallow ponds. The plant features broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface to repel water. Its flowers are small and white, with a subtle fragrance, and bloom during the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and pollution, Colymbada nimrodis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
