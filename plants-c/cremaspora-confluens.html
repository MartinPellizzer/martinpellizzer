<p>Cremaspora confluens, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, often multi-stemmed structure and small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>Cremaspora confluens is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber.</p>
