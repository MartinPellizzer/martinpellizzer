<p>Cytisus capitatus subsp.</p>
<p>ciliatus, commonly known as the ciliate broom, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The leaves are trifoliate, with three oval to lance-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its finely ciliate (fringed) margins on the leaves, which distinguish it from other cytisus species.</p>
