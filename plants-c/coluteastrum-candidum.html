<p>It is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Coluteastrum candidum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
