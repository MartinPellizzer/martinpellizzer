                    <h1>Cissus simplex</h1>
<p>Cissus simplex, commonly known as the bonebrake or silver vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Cissus simplex is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to climb structures.</p>
