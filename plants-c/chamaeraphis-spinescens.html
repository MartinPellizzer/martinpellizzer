<p>Chamaeraphis spinescens, commonly known as the spiny glassworts, is a halophyte species that thrives in saline and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered with fine, salt-excreting glands. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in the summer months. Its structure allows it to retain water and tolerate high salinity, making it an important component of salt marsh ecosystems.</p>
<p>Chamaeraphis spinescens plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
