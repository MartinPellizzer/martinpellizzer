<p>Crepidium riparium, commonly known as the river orchid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of streams and rivers, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, making it ecologically important in flood-prone areas.</p>
<p>Crepidium riparium is often found in temperate regions of North America and is valued for its ornamental and ecological roles.</p>
