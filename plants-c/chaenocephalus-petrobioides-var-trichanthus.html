<p>It is a brown algae that thrives in shallow, saline waters along coastlines. The plant has a distinctive, flattened thallus with a leathery texture and a bladdery structure that helps it retain water. It plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms.</p>
