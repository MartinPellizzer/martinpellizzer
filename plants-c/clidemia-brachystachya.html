<p>Clidemia brachystachya, commonly known as the short-stalked mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows on the branches of other trees, drawing water and nutrients from its host. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds, which can adhere to other plants.</p>
<p>Clidemia brachystachya plays a role in local ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain insect species.</p>
