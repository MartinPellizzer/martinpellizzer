                    <h1>Corydalis osmastonii</h1>
<p>Corydalis osmastonii, commonly known as the Osmaston's corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often pink or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a tuberous root system typical of many Corydalis species. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
