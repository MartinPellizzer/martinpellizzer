                    <h1>Chondrilla arenicola</h1>
<p>Chondrilla arenicola, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, exhibiting a low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by the development of cylindrical, wind-dispersed seeds. Its root system is extensive and adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, drought-prone environments.</p>
<p>Chondrilla arenicola plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
