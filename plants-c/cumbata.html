                    <h1>Cumbata</h1>
<p>Cumbata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Cumbata is now considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
