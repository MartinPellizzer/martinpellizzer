                    <h1>Cheilanthes flexuosa</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spore-bearing fronds that are typically arranged in a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes flexuosa is often found growing on limestone or sandstone cliffs, where it forms dense colonies in crevices.</p>
