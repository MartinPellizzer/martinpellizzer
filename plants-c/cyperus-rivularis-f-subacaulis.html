                    <h1>Cyperus rivularis f. subacaulis</h1>
<p>Cyperus rivularis f. subacaulis, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a variant of the flatsedge genus characterized by its reduced stature and slender growth habit.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. Its botanical structure is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, with rhizomes that help in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in shallow water or moist soils, contributing to the ecological diversity of wetland habitats.</p>
