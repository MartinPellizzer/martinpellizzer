<p>Celsia cretica var. pinnatisecta, commonly known as the Cretan celsia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Crete.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, pinnatisected leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow to white, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
