<p>Chamaeraphis forbesiana, commonly known as Forbes' glassworts, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in dune environments and tidal zones. It has a creeping growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions makes it an important pioneer species in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
