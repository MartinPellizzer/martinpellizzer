<p>Cycas arnhemica subsp.</p>
<p>natja, commonly known as the Natja cycas, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to the Northern Territory of Australia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length.</p>
<p>The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments of its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
