                    <h1>Caralluma tuberculata</h1>
<p>Caralluma tuberculata, commonly known as the trumpet cactus or desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branching stem system with spiny, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to tubercles, and it has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the soil.</p>
<p>Caralluma tuberculata is also known for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
