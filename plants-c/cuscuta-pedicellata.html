                    <h1>Cuscuta pedicellata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta pedicellata, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle that involves germination, attachment to a host, and the formation of a haustorium to extract water and nutrients. The plant is often found growing on crops like corn and soybeans, making it a significant agricultural pest. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it challenging to control.</p>
<p>Cuscuta pedicellata plays an important role in ecological systems, though its parasitic nature can have detrimental effects on its host plants.</p>
