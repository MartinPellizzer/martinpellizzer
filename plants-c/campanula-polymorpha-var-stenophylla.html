                    <h1>Campanula polymorpha var. stenophylla</h1>
<p>Campanula polymorpha var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to violet. The leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period, typically from late spring to early summer.</p>
