<p>Cinnamomum petrophilum, commonly known as the rock cinnamon, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, woody bark and small, clustered leaves that are typically dark green in color. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Its essential oils, derived from the bark, are valued for their medicinal and aromatic properties.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cinnamomum petrophilum is considered a conservation concern.</p>
