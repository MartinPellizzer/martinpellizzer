<p>Chamaesyce chamaesycoides, commonly known as the creeping sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Portulacaceae, which includes many species with succulent characteristics. The plant features fleshy, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and sandy soils. Its small, greenish-white flowers are inconspicuous but attract pollinators like bees and flies.</p>
<p>The leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
