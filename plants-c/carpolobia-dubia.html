                    <h1>Carpolobia dubia</h1>
<p>Carpolobia dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has slender, pale green stems and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Its unique appearance and limited habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and climate change, Carpolobia dubia is considered endangered and faces significant threats to its survival.</p>
