<p>It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The plant produces small, cup-shaped fruits that contain one or two seeds, typical of the genus Cyclobalanopsis. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
