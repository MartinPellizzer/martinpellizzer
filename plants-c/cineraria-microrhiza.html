<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, blue or violet flowers. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a border plant.</p>
