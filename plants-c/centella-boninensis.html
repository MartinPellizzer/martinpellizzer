<p>Centella boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin centella, is a flowering plant native to the Bonin Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas or on rocky substrates. It has a low-growing habit with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Centella boninensis is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
