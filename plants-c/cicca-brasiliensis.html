<p>Cicca brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian cycad, is a unique plant native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and reproduces through cones. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is also considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
