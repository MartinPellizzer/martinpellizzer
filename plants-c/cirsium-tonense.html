                    <h1>Cirsium tonense</h1>
<p>Cirsium tonense, commonly known as the Turkish thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its leaves are spiny and covered in dense, white hairs, which help to deter herbivores.</p>
<p>The showy purple to pink flowers appear in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
