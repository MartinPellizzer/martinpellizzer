                    <h1>Crassula × justi-corderoyi</h1>
<p>Crassula × justi-corderoyi, commonly known as the Jade Plant or Christmas Cactus, is a hybrid succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the cooler months. It is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its hybrid origin, combining traits from both Crassula and other related species.</p>
