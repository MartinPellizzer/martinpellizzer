<p>Calligonum borsczowii, commonly known as the Borsczowii boxthorn, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, round fruits. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in landscaping for erosion control in dry climates.</p>
