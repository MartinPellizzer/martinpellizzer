<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in small, tuberculate bumps, which give it a distinctive, spiny appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
