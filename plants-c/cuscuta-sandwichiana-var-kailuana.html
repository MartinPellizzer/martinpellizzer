                    <h1>Cuscuta sandwichiana var. kailuana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta sandwichiana var. kailuana, commonly known as the Kailua dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to species like Acacia and Pipturus. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like stem that coils around its host. It plays a role in the unique ecological dynamics of Hawaiian ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
