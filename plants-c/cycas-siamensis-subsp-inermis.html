<p>Cycas siamensis subsp.</p>
<p>inermis, commonly known as the Siam cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones typically appearing on separate plants. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in its native range.</p>
