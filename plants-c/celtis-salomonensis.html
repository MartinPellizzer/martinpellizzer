<p>Celtis salomonensis, commonly known as the Solomon Islands hackberry, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the Pacific islands, particularly the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cannabaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe.</p>
<p>Celtis salomonensis is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used for construction and tool-making.</p>
