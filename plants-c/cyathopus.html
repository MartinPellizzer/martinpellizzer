                    <h1>Cyathopus</h1>
<p>Cyathopus, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap microscopic organisms. Cyathopus species are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. They are carnivorous, relying on the trapped prey for nutrients in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology and ecological role make them an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
