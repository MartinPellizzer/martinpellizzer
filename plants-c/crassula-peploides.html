                    <h1>Crassula peploides</h1>
<p>Crassula peploides, commonly known as the woolly crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant typically forms low, compact rosettes and produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ease of care, it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant.</p>
