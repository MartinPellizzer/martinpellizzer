                    <h1>Carex pallescens var. neogaea</h1>
<p>Carex pallescens var. neogaea, commonly known as the silver sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. This variant is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats.</p>
