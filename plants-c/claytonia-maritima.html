                    <h1>Claytonia maritima</h1>
<p>Claytonia maritima, commonly known as sea kale, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and in moist, rocky habitats. The plant features rosettes of waxy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Small, white flowers with five petals appear in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees.</p>
<p>It is valued for its edible leaves, which have a mild, cabbage-like flavor and are historically used in coastal cuisines.</p>
