                    <h1>Cleistes gracilis</h1>
<p>Cleistes gracilis, commonly known as the slender cleistocarp, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Oenotheraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that remain closed during the day. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that open only at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Cleistes gracilis typically grows in moist, shaded habitats like woodlands and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and pollination strategy make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
