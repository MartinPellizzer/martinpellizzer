<p>Cubospermum palustre, commonly known as the marsh cubospermum, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit, with long, slender stems that often float on the water surface. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and ribbon-like, adapted for buoyancy and light absorption in water.</p>
<p>Cubospermum palustre plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
