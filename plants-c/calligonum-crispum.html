                    <h1>Calligonum crispum</h1>
<p>Calligonum crispum, commonly known as the curled sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and silver-gray foliage, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots make it well-suited for stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Calligonum crispum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
