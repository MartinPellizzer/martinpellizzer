                    <h1>Cassytha casuarinae</h1>
<p>Cassytha casuarinae, commonly known as the coastal dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using its yellow, thread-like stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
