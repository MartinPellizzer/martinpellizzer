                    <h1>Cephalostigma nanella</h1>
<p>Cephalostigma nanella, commonly known as the small-headed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are short and often clustered at the base, with the bladders emerging from the leaf axils.</p>
<p>Cephalostigma nanella is a carnivorous plant, relying on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
