                    <h1>Carex filipes var. filipes</h1>
<p>Carex filipes var. filipes, commonly known as the slender filifera sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its native environment.</p>
<p>The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects.</p>
