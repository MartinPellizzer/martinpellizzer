<p>Cycas undulata, commonly known as the undulate cycad, is a species of cycad native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves that are often wavy or undulating in appearance. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid and often covered in a fibrous sheath. Cycas undulata is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and heathlands.</p>
<p>It is considered a long-lived plant with a slow growth rate, and it plays an important role in its native ecosystems.</p>
