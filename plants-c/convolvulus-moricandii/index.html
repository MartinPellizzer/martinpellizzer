<p>Caucasian morning glory, scientifically known as Convolvulus moricandii, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. With its vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in a range of colors from white to deep purple, it captivates botanists and gardeners alike. This species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in rocky, arid environments, making it a resilient addition to any landscape. Its name reflects both its geographical origin and its habit of blooming in the early morning, adding a touch of natural elegance to its surroundings. Despite its beauty, Convolvulus moricandii remains a relatively lesser-known species in the world of horticulture.</p>
