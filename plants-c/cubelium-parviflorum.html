<p>Cubelium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flower cubelium, is a unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped, adapted to the cool, moist environments it inhabits. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Cubelium parviflorum is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
