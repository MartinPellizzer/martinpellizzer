                    <h1>Cuscuta serruloba</h1>
<p>Cuscuta serruloba, commonly known as the serrulate dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around host plants, forming a dense network. The plant is native to parts of North America and is often found on a variety of herbaceous hosts. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
