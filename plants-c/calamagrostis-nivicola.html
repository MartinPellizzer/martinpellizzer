                    <h1>Calamagrostis nivicola</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis nivicola, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects the harsh, cold environments it inhabits. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral display to its otherwise muted appearance. Calamagrostis nivicola is adapted to nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its resilience to extreme cold and limited growing seasons make it an important component of tundra and alpine ecosystems.</p>
