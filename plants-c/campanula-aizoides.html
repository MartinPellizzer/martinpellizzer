                    <h1>Campanula aizoides</h1>
<p>Campanula aizoides, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Campanula aizoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine conditions.</p>
