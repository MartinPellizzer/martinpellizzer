                    <h1>Candollea disperma</h1>
<p>Candollea disperma, commonly known as the scattered spore fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate fronds that resemble ferns. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Its habitat is typically moist, shaded areas in mountainous regions, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Candollea disperma is often found in isolated populations, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
