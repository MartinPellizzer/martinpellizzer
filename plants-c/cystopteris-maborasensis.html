<p>Cystopteris maborasensis, commonly known as the Maboras fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
