                    <h1>Carponema aggregata</h1>
<p>Carponema aggregata, commonly known as the clustered liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically green and grow in moist, shaded environments. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption. Carponema aggregata often forms colonies on rocks or soil surfaces, contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and reliance on water for reproduction make it a typical representative of the liverwort group.</p>
