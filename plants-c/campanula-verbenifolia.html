<p>Campanula verbenifolia, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems that spread along the ground. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Campanula verbenifolia is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
