                    <h1>Cohniella allenii</h1>
<p>Cohniella allenii, commonly known as the Allen's cohniella, is a rare and lesser-known fungal species belonging to the family Cryphonectriaceae.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in specific forested environments, particularly in association with certain tree species. The fungus is characterized by its unique morphology, including its distinct spore structure and growth patterns. It plays a role in the decomposition of organic matter within its ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is of interest to mycologists studying fungal biodiversity.</p>
