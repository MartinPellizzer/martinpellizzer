                    <h1>Coelogyne sigmatochilus</h1>
<p>Coelogyne sigmatochilus, commonly known as the S-shaped lip orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in summer, with a distinctive S-shaped lip that sets it apart from other coelogyne species. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered in a thick, leathery sheath, which helps it store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
