<p>Cattleya × clonia, commonly known as the Clonia Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Cattleya labiata and Cattleya mossiae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange, with intricate patterns and a strong, spicy fragrance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media.</p>
<p>Cattleya × clonia is prized for its ornamental value and is widely cultivated for floral arrangements and horticultural displays.</p>
