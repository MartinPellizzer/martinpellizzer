<p>Capsella procumbens var. diffusa, commonly known as the spreading peppergrass, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. This variant is distinguished by its more diffuse growth habit compared to the typical form of Capsella procumbens.</p>
<p>It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along the edges of forests.</p>
