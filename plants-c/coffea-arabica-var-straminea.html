                    <h1>Coffea arabica var. straminea</h1>
<p>Coffea arabica var. straminea, commonly known as the straw-colored coffee plant, is a less common variety of Arabica coffee.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow or straw-colored leaves, which distinguish it from the typical green foliage of most coffee plants. This variety is native to Ethiopia and is often found in higher altitude regions with cool, moist climates. The plant produces small, red berries that contain two seeds, which are used to make coffee.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited cultivation, it is considered a rare and ornamental species in botanical gardens.</p>
