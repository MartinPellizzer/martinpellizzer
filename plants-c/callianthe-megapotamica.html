<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, often displaying vibrant colors such as yellow, red, and orange. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in the humid, often nutrient-poor conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>The orchid's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a significant species in the biodiversity of the Amazonian ecosystem.</p>
