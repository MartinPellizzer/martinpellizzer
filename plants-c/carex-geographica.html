                    <h1>Carex geographica</h1>
<p>Carex geographica, commonly known as the geographic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spikelets that are often arranged in a distinctive, somewhat zigzag pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along the edges of ponds and streams. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Carex geographica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects.</p>
