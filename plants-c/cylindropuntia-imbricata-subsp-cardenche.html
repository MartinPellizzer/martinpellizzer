<p>Cylindropuntia imbricata subsp.</p>
<p>cardenche, commonly known as the Cardenche cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are segmented and covered in small, spiny tubercles.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a succulent structure that allows it to store water efficiently.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
