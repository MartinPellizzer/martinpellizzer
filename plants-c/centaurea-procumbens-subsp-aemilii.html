<p>Centaurea procumbens subsp.</p>
<p>aemilii, commonly known as the Emilian spreading centaury, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground.</p>
<p>The plant produces bright blue to purple composite flowers with distinctive central disk flowers surrounded by ray florets. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry landscapes.</p>
