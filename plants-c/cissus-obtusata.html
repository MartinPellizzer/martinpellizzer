<p>Cissus obtusata, commonly known as the African stone plant, is a member of the family Vitaceae.</p>
<p>It is a climbing or trailing plant characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically covered with a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals.</p>
<p>Cissus obtusata is native to southern Africa and is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
