<p>Crinum norfolkianum, commonly known as the Norfolk garlic lily, is a striking tropical plant native to the island of Norfolk in Australia.</p>
<p>It features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a prominent central spike and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is characterized by its robust underground bulb, which stores nutrients and allows it to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and can grow up to 1.5 meters in height.</p>
<p>Crinum norfolkianum prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
