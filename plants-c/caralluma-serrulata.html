                    <h1>Caralluma serrulata</h1>
<p>Caralluma serrulata, commonly known as the serrated devil's tongue, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its spiny, succulent stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are reduced to small spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Caralluma serrulata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though scientific research on its properties is limited.</p>
