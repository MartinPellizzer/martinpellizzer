<p>Conopholis panamensis, commonly known as the Panama bottlebrush, is a unique flowering plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients. The plant produces small, red or orange flowers arranged in dense clusters, giving it a bottlebrush-like appearance. Its leaves are small and scale-like, and it typically grows in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Conopholis panamensis plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators and contributing to forest biodiversity.</p>
