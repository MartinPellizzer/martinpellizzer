                    <h1>Cynodon filiformis</h1>
<p>Cynodon filiformis, commonly known as slender carpetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has fine, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a nuisance and a resilient plant in various ecosystems.</p>
