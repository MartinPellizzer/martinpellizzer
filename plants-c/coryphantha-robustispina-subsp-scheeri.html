<p>Coryphantha robustispina subsp.</p>
<p>scheeri, commonly known as the Scheer's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, spiny areoles, giving it a distinctive hedgehog-like appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne in the axils of the spines. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
