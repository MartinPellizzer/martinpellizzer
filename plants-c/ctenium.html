                    <h1>Ctenium</h1>
<p>Ctenium, commonly known as beach grass, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in sandy or saline soils. They are characterized by their tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are adapted to withstand wind and salt spray. Ctenium species often play a crucial role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Their seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to their ability to colonize new areas along shorelines.</p>
