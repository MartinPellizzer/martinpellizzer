<p>Cerefolium anthriscus, commonly known as lesser celandine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of smooth, waxy, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically bright yellow to green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream sides.</p>
<p>Cerefolium anthriscus is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native plants.</p>
