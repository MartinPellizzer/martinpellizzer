<p>Cereus poselgerianus, commonly known as the Poselgerian candleplant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a tall, unbranched stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height, covered with a dense layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces large, showy white flowers at night, which emit a strong, sweet scent to attract pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to small, spiny structures, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>The species is often cultivated for its striking appearance and unique nocturnal blooming habit.</p>
