                    <h1>Clompanus zippelii</h1>
<p>Clompanus zippelii, commonly known as the Zippelâ€™s flameleaf, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate forests of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bi-colored leaves that display a deep green on the top and a vibrant red underside. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of orange and yellow, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial shade to full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
