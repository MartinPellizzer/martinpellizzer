                    <h1>Calacinum sagittifolium</h1>
<p>Calacinum sagittifolium, commonly known as the arrowleaf calacinum, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves, which are narrow and pointed, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, adapted to attract specific pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to harsh, desert-like environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is often studied for its adaptations to extreme climates.</p>
