                <h1>Callicarpa cana</h1>
<p>Callicarpa cana, commonly known as the red beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The berries are edible for birds and small mammals but are generally not recommended for human consumption due to their tart flavor and potential toxicity. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and striking fruit display.</p>
