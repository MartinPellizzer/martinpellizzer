<p>Caralluma nebrownii var. pseudonebrownii, commonly known as the false desert cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, spineless stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small spines, and it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other Caralluma species and shares similar adaptations to drought and heat.</p>
