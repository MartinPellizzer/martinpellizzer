<p>Ctenitis velutina, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a rare and unique species of fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, velvety texture and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing capsules, are typically located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its distinctive appearance and limited distribution, Ctenitis velutina is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
