<p>Chenopodium glaucum var. pulchrum, commonly known as the ornamental goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it both an ornamental and ecological asset in dry landscapes.</p>
