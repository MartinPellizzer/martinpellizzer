<p>Crioceras dipladeniiflorus, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
