<p>Ctenitis angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, narrow fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Ctenitis angusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions.</p>
