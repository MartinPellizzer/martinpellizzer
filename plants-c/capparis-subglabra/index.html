                            <h1>Capparis Subglabra</h1>
<p>Cape gooseberry, scientifically known as Capparis subglabra, is a unique and resilient plant native to southern Africa. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and distinctive yellowish flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit, which resembles a small, round berry, is both edible and highly valued in local cuisines. Despite its modest appearance, the Cape gooseberry plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity and traditional farming practices.</p>
