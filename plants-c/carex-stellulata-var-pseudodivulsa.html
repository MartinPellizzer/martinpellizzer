                    <h1>Carex stellulata var. pseudodivulsa</h1>
<p>Carex stellulata var. pseudodivulsa, commonly known as the star sedge, is a perennial sedge native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet to moist habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It has narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife.</p>
