                            <h1>Cirsium Horridum</h1>
<p>Goatweed, scientifically known as Cirsium horridum, is a prickly flowering plant native to the western United States. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. With its spiny stems and purple to pink flower heads, it stands out in its environment. Despite its appearance, it plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various insects and animals. Its common name reflects its historical use by livestock, though it is generally avoided due to its harsh characteristics.</p>
