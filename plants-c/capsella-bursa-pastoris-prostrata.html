<p>Capsella bursa-pastoris prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate common chickweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes, and small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in early spring. Its fruit is a distinctive, heart-shaped capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed soils, along pathways, and in gardens, where it can become a weed.</p>
