<p>Ctenitis troupinii, commonly known as the Troupin's tree fern, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Its fronds are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants in humid environments.</p>
