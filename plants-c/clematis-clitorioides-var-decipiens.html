<p>Clematis clitorioides var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 15 feet, allowing it to climb trees and shrubs effectively. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, often with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are compound, consisting of three to five oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in partial to full sun with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its ability to attract pollinators and its relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
