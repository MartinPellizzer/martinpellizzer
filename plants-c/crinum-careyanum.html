<p>Crinum careyanum, commonly known as the Cape lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features tall, strap-like leaves and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for gardens with good drainage.</p>
<p>Crinum careyanum is also known for its resilience and ability to naturalize in suitable climates.</p>
