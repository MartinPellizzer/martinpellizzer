                    <h1>Cheilanthes subargentea</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes subargentea, commonly known as the silver-tipped rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and silver-white to grayish-green fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant is adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in low-water environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. Its fronds are typically divided into narrow segments, and the sporangia are borne on the undersides of the leaves.</p>
<p>This fern is often found growing on limestone or granite substrates, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies.</p>
