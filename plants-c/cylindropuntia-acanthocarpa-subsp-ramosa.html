<p>Cylindropuntia acanthocarpa subsp.</p>
<p>ramosa, commonly known as the ramose cholla, is a spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, segmented stems that branch profusely, giving it a bushy appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its stems are covered in small, hair-like structures called areoles, which serve as the attachment points for spines, flowers, and branches.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
