<p>Castilleja rubicundula, commonly known as the red-stemmed Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a short, stout stem and lacks true leaves, relying on its root system to absorb nutrients from neighboring plants. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe.</p>
<p>Castilleja rubicundula plays an important role in pollination and is a symbol of the wildflower diversity in its native range.</p>
