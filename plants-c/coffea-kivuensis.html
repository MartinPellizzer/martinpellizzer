<p>Coffea kivuensis, commonly known as the Kivu coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Albertine Rift in eastern Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds used to make coffee. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1â€“2 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coffea kivuensis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
