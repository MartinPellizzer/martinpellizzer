<p>Cheilanthes selinoides, commonly known as the rock fern or desert shield fern, is a terrestrial fern that thrives in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant has thick, leathery fronds that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, protective layer of hair, which aids in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of North America, including parts of the southwestern United States and Mexico.</p>
