<p>Cybianthus huberi, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Cybianthus huberi is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
