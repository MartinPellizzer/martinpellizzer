                    <h1>Carpinus laxiflora var. macrostachya</h1>
<p>Carpinus laxiflora var. macrostachya, commonly known as the broad-stalked hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are followed by small, winged samaras in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its larger staminate catkins compared to the typical form of Carpinus laxiflora.</p>
