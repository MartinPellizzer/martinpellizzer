                    <h1>Cypripedium guttatum subsp. microsaccos</h1>
<p>Cypripedium guttatum subsp.</p>
<p>microsaccos, commonly known as the small-sac lady's slipper, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like lip that is often adorned with intricate markings.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale pink or white, with a single, prominent sepal and two smaller petals.</p>
<p>This subspecies is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection for the floral trade.</p>
