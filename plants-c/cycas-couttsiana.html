                    <h1>Cycas couttsiana</h1>
<p>Cycas couttsiana, commonly known as the Coutts' cycad, is a species of cycad native to the island of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male cones being clustered at the base of the plant and female cones emerging from the crown. Cycas couttsiana is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes.</p>
