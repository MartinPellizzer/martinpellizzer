                    <h1>Corytoplectus deltoideus</h1>
<p>Corytoplectus deltoideus, commonly known as the delta sand dollar, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the family Chancelloriidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, disc-shaped body covered in a calcareous skeleton with a distinctive pattern of radial and concentric ridges. The plant, or more accurately the organism, thrives in shallow coastal waters, particularly in sandy substrates. Its skeletal structure is composed of calcium carbonate, forming a hard, protective layer.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to sediment stability and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
