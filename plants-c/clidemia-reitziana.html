                    <h1>Clidemia reitziana</h1>
<p>Clidemia reitziana, commonly known as the Hawaiian stiltgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in Hawaii, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
