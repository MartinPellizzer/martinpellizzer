                    <h1>Cactus × mallisonii</h1>
<p>Cactus × mallisonii, commonly known as the hybrid cactus, is a naturally occurring hybrid between the prickly pear (Opuntia) and the night-blooming cereus (Cereus).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, a feature typical of cacti adapted to arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that open at night, often in shades of white, yellow, or pink. It is native to regions of South America where its parent species overlap geographically.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses in warm climates.</p>
