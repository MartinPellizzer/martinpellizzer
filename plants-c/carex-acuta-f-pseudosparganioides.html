<p>It is a perennial plant that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has a robust rhizomatous root system, which allows it to spread and form dense stands. Its inflorescence consists of two distinct spikelets, with the lower one being shorter and more compact.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils.</p>
