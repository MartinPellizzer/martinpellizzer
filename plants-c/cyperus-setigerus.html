<p>Cyperus setigerus, commonly known as the swamp spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland areas in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes.</p>
<p>Cyperus setigerus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and water filtration.</p>
