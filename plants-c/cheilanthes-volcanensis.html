                    <h1>Cheilanthes volcanensis</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes volcanensis, commonly known as the volcanic lip fern, is a species of fern native to volcanic regions in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows on rocky outcrops and in crevices, thriving in harsh, nutrient-poor environments. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white trichomes. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ability to colonize volcanic soils quickly after eruptions, making it an indicator of ecological recovery in such environments.</p>
