<p>Chamaemespilus humilis, commonly known as the creeping elder or dwarf elder, is a small, deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with multiple stems that often root at the nodes, forming a dense, low-growing plant. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate, with a rough, hairy texture on both surfaces. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by small, dark blue berries that are edible but have a bitter taste.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in moist, shady areas such as woodland edges and stream banks.</p>
