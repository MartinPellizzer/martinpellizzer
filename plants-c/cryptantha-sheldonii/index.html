                            <h1>Cryptantha Sheldonii</h1>
<p>Cryptantha sheldonii is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is known for its delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. This species thrives in rocky soils and is often found in scrubland and coastal dunes. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
