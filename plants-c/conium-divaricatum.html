                    <h1>Conium divaricatum</h1>
<p>Conium divaricatum, commonly known as the slender hemlock, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces a toxic compound called coniine, which makes it highly poisonous to both animals and humans. Its appearance can be mistaken for edible plants like parsley or hemlock, leading to potential misidentification and poisoning.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity and similarity to other plants, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings.</p>
