<p>Caladenia longicauda subsp.</p>
<p>insularis, commonly known as the Lord Howe Island spider-orchid, is an endemic orchid species found exclusively on Lord Howe Island. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stem and a single, narrow, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive hood-like labellum.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. It relies on specific pollinators, primarily flies, for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat fragility, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and invasive species.</p>
