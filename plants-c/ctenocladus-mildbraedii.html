                    <h1>Ctenocladus mildbraedii</h1>
<p>Ctenocladus mildbraedii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in opposite pairs along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or yellow and serve as a food source for birds and other animals.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
