                <h1>Cereus hempelii</h1>
<p>Cereus hempelii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent leaves are modified into spines, reducing transpiration and enhancing survival in harsh climates.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
