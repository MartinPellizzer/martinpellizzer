<p>Chamaecyparis thujiformis, commonly known as the Japanese cedar or kuril cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the northern Pacific coast of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, columnar form and scale-like leaves that are blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, typical of the cypress family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and longevity, it is valued for both its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
