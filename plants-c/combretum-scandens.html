                    <h1>Combretum scandens</h1>
<p>Combretum scandens, commonly known as the climbing combretum, is a woody shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, twining stems that allow it to climb and form dense thickets. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often fragrant and attract various pollinators. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface, varying in texture depending on the environment.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread in natural habitats.</p>
