<p>Corchorus sericeus subsp.</p>
<p>densiflorus, commonly known as silky dock, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China and India. It is characterized by its soft, silky hairs covering the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its fibrous stems, it has been used historically for textile production and as a source of dietary fiber.</p>
