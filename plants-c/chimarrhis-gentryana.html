<p>Chimarrhis gentryana, commonly known as the Gentry's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns resembling ghostly apparitions. Native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chimarrhis gentryana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
