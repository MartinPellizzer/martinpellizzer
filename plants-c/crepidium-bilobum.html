<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and wetlands. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in a spike, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it has a rhizomatous root system that helps it survive in wet environments.</p>
