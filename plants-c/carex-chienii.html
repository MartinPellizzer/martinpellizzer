                    <h1>Carex chienii</h1>
<p>Carex chienii, commonly known as the Chien's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps, making it a valuable plant for wetland restoration.</p>
<p>Carex chienii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
