                    <h1>Chlorophytum pulverulentum</h1>
<p>Chlorophytum pulverulentum, commonly known as the dust plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Asparagaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can appear dusty or powdery due to a natural coating. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>The dust plant is also known for its ability to purify the air and is often used in air-purifying plant collections.</p>
