                    <h1>Chlamydocola lastoursvillensis</h1>
<p>Chlamydocola lastoursvillensis, commonly known as the Lastoursville cypress, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Comoros archipelago.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including its dense, scale-like leaves and conical shape. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is typically found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator of undisturbed ecosystems and its potential for genetic diversity in coniferous species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
