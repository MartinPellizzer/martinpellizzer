<p>Convolvulus turcomanicus, commonly known as Turkman bindweed, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinct five-lobed corolla. Its tendrils allow it to climb and twine around other vegetation, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often hairy, contributing to its adaptability in harsh climates.</p>
