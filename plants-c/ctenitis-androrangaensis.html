<p>Ctenitis androrangaensis, commonly known as the Madagascar tree fern, is a species native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, with a thick, fibrous root system that helps it anchor in the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>This fern is an important component of the rainforest ecosystem, providing habitat and contributing to biodiversity.</p>
