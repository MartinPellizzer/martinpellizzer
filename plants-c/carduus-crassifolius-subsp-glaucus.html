<p>Carduus crassifolius subsp.</p>
<p>glaucus, commonly known as the glaucous thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy purple to pink flower heads that are composed of many small florets arranged in a composite flower structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range.</p>
