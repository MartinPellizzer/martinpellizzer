                    <h1>Calanthe nivalis</h1>
<p>Calanthe nivalis, commonly known as the snow calanthe, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the high altitudes of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizome and its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires partial shade to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
