                    <h1>Cupressus articulata</h1>
<p>Cupressus articulata, commonly known as the Arizona cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, columnar shape and scale-like foliage that gives it a dense, compact appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. Its bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, adding to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The Arizona cypress is adapted to arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species.</p>
