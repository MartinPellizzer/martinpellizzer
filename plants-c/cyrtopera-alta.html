<p>Cyrtopera alta, commonly known as the high mountain orchid, is a species of orchid native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its root system is adapted to anchor in loose soil and absorb nutrients from the rocky substrate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Cyrtopera alta is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
