                    <h1>Corallorhiza trifida var. ericetorum</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza trifida var. ericetorum, commonly known as the Ericaceous Coralroot, is a terrestrial orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-red flowers that are typically arranged in a loose spike, and it thrives in acidic, shaded habitats. It is often found in association with ericaceous plants such as heather and blueberries, which contribute to its specific ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to its reliance on fungal symbiosis, it is considered an indicator species for healthy, undisturbed forest ecosystems.</p>
