                    <h1>Coffea calycina</h1>
<p>Coffea calycina, commonly known as the rose coffee or the pink coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, including countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and red or pink berries that contain the coffee beans. It is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its coffee beans, which are smaller and less potent than those of other coffee species.</p>
<p>The plant prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for shaded garden environments.</p>
