                    <h1>Cenchrus niloticus</h1>
<p>Cenchrus niloticus, commonly known as the Nile grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshy areas or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
