<p>Cylindropuntia acanthocarpa subsp.</p>
<p>acanthocarpa, commonly known as the thorned cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are segmented and covered in spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>The subspecies is notable for its ability to form dense clumps, contributing to the ecological structure of its habitat.</p>
