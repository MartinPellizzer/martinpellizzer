<p>Cybianthus spathulifolius, commonly known as the broad-leafed cybianthus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences composed of numerous small, yellow flowers arranged in a spathelate structure. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific growing conditions to flourish.</p>
