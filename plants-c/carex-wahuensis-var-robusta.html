                    <h1>Carex wahuensis var. robusta</h1>
<p>Carex wahuensis var. robusta, commonly known as the Wahu sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spikelets that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in coastal or lowland habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species in its native range.</p>
