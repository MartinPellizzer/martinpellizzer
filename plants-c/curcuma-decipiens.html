                    <h1>Curcuma decipiens</h1>
<p>Curcuma decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive turmeric, is a member of the Zingiberaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its striking, orange-red inflorescence, which is often mistaken for the more familiar yellow turmeric (Curcuma longa). Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, though they are less commonly consumed than those of other curcuma species.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Curcuma decipiens make it a valuable ornamental and medicinal plant in horticulture and herbal practices.</p>
