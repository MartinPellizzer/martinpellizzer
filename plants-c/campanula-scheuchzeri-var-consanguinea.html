                    <h1>Campanula scheuchzeri var. consanguinea</h1>
<p>Campanula scheuchzeri var. consanguinea, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps.</p>
<p>It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountain slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
