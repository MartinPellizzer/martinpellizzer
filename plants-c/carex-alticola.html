                    <h1>Carex alticola</h1>
<p>Carex alticola, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as alpine meadows and mountain streams. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Carex alticola is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate both wet and dry conditions depending on its habitat.</p>
