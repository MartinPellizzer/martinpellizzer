<p>Chaetochloa flava, commonly known as goldenhair grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy habitats in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, bright yellow-green leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Chaetochloa flava is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
