<p>Chrysanthemum potaninii var. amphiseriaceum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chrysanthemum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>

It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a cut flower.</p>
