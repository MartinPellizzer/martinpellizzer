                    <h1>Cephalophis lukei</h1>
<p>Cephalophis lukei, commonly known as the Luke's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant produces small, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found growing on tree trunks or branches, a trait known as epiphytism.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cephalophis lukei is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
