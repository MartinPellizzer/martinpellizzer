                    <h1>Chaetocalyx schottii</h1>
<p>Chaetocalyx schottii, commonly known as the Schott's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often found growing on the branches of host trees such as Ficus species. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are small, round berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to host plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain bird species.</p>
