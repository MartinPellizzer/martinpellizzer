                    <h1>Caragana pendula</h1>
<p>Caragana pendula, commonly known as the weeping shrub or Siberian pea shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cascading branches that bear small, pea-like flowers in early spring. The plant produces yellow to orange pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or sandy landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its distinctive, drooping form and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
