<p>Caloptilium lagascae var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly caloptilium, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The varietal name *lanata* refers to its velvety, lanose (woolly) texture, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions.</p>
