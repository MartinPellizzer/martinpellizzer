                    <h1>Cardamine maritima f. bipinnata</h1>
<p>Cardamine maritima f. bipinnata, commonly known as the coastal buttercup, is a rare and specialized plant species that thrives in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It is often found in dune habitats and is sensitive to environmental changes, making it an indicator species for coastal health.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to habitat destruction and climate change.</p>
