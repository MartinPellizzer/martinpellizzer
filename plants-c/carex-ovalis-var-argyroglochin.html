<p>Carex ovalis var. argyroglochin, commonly known as silver-tongue sedge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a silvery sheen, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-brown flowers in the summer, which are followed by maturing seeds. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
