<p>Conopodium seselifolium, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant has whorled leaves that are often submerged, with some leaves extending above the water surface. It reproduces both sexually through seeds and asexually through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems, supporting biodiversity in wetland environments.</p>
