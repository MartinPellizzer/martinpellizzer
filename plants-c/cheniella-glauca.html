                    <h1>Cheniella glauca</h1>
<p>Cheniella glauca, commonly known as the blue cheniella, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and blue-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cheniella glauca is adapted to dry conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
