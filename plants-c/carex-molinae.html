                    <h1>Carex molinae</h1>
<p>Carex molinae, commonly known as Molina's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescence, typical of the sedge genus. Native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, it thrives in moist, temperate environments. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, contributing to ecological stability in these habitats.</p>
