<p>Cordylanthus rigidus var. ferrisiaus, commonly known as the rigid thornsteppe, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, spiny stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is part of the legume family and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
