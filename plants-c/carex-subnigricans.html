                    <h1>Carex subnigricans</h1>
<p>Carex subnigricans, commonly known as black-stem sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, grass-like leaves and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Carex subnigricans is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, waterlogged soils.</p>
