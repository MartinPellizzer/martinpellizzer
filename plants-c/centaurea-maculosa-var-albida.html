                    <h1>Centaurea maculosa var. albida</h1>
<p>Centaurea maculosa var. albida, commonly known as the white-centred coneflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white to pale pink petals surrounding a central yellow cone-like structure. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. It produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
