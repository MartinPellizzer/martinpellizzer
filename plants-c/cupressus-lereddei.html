                    <h1>Cupressus lereddei</h1>
<p>Cupressus lereddei, commonly known as the Leredde's cypress, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the island of Socotra.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, scale-like leaves and distinctive, umbrella-shaped crown. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is adapted to the arid, rocky environment of its native habitat. It produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in a challenging ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
