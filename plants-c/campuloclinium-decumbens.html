<p>Campuloclinium decumbens, commonly known as creeping cowpea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in moist, sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
