                    <h1>Chamaesyce pilulifera var. procumbens</h1>
<p>Chamaesyce pilulifera var. procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
