                    <h1>Cynodon decipiens</h1>
<p>Cynodon decipiens, commonly known as the false bermudagrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, southern Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in degraded grasslands.</p>
<p>Its ability to spread rapidly makes it both a useful forage plant and an invasive weed in some regions.</p>
