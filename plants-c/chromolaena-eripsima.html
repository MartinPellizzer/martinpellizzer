<p>Chromolaena eripsima, commonly known as the flame bush, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common ornamental plant in warm climates.</p>
