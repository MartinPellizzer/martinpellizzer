<p>Chionochloa nivifera, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of silver-gray leaves that reflect light, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Chionochloa nivifera plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates in its native range.</p>
