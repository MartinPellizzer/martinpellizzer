                    <h1>Cheilanthes tamburii</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes tamburii, commonly known as the desert shield fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are typically clustered near the margins. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky crevices or along dry streambeds.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
