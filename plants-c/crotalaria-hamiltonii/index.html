                            <h1>Crotalaria Hamiltonii</h1>
<p>Crotalaria hamiltonii is a striking member of the legume family native to tropical regions of Africa and the Caribbean. This plant is known for its vibrant, spurred flowers that range from yellow to orange, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing as a shrub or small tree. Despite its beauty, it contains toxic alkaloids, requiring caution when handling or consuming any part of the plant. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a fascinating subject for botanists and gardeners alike.</p>
