<p>Cousinia cirsioides, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Cousinia cirsioides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range.</p>
