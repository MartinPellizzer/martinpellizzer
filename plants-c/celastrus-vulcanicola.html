                    <h1>Celastrus vulcanicola</h1>
<p>Celastrus vulcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic bindweed, is a rare flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, acidic soils typical of volcanic landscapes. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Despite its limited distribution, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its unique habitat.</p>
