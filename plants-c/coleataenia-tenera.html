                    <h1>Coleataenia tenera</h1>
<p>Coleataenia tenera, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and marshes, where it forms dense colonies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
