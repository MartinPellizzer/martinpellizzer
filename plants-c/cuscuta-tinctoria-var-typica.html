                    <h1>Cuscuta tinctoria var. typica</h1>
<p>Cuscuta tinctoria var. typica, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed germination, attachment to a host, and eventual flowering. The plant is characterized by its long, thread-like stems that wrap around its host, forming a dense network. It is native to various regions in Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and is often found growing on crops like barley and wheat.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural plants.</p>
