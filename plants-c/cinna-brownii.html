<p>Cinna brownii, commonly known as the Brown's cinnamon fern, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that resemble those of a fern, with a distinct central stem covered in brown, cinnamon-like spore-bearing structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Cinna brownii is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
