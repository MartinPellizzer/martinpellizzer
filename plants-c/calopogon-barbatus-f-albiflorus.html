                    <h1>Calopogon barbatus f. albiflorus</h1>
<p>Calopogon barbatus f. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered bog orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive, showy white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and swampy areas, where it forms dense colonies. Its flowers are adorned with intricate patterns and are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
