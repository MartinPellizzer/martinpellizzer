                    <h1>Cuscuta tucumana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta tucumana, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host to establish a connection. The plant is native to South America and is often found growing on crops such as corn and beans. Its rapid growth and ability to infest a wide range of hosts make it a significant agricultural pest.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Cuscuta tucumana has been studied for its potential in biological control and ecological research.</p>
