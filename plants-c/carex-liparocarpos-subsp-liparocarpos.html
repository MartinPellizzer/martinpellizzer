<p>Carex liparocarpos subsp.</p>
<p>liparocarpos, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a species of sedge native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable indicator species for assessing ecosystem health in cold climates.</p>
