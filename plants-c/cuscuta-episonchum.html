                    <h1>Cuscuta episonchum</h1>
<p>Cuscuta episonchum, commonly known as the Indian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to regions of Asia, including India, and is often found on crops such as rice and millet. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its invasive potential in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Cuscuta episonchum can cause significant yield losses in crops, making it a problematic weed in many farming systems.</p>
