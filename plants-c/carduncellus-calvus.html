                    <h1>Carduncellus calvus</h1>
<p>Carduncellus calvus, commonly known as the hairy cardoon, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by spiky, woody fruits. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in cooking.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
