                            <h1>Canscora Helferiana</h1>
<p>Canscora helferiana is a rare and fascinating plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is known for its unique morphological features and medicinal potential. This species thrives in cool, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered endangered by conservationists. Its study offers valuable insights into plant adaptation and biodiversity in mountain ecosystems.</p>
