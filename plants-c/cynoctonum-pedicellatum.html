<p>Cynoctonum pedicellatum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic in shape and have a leathery texture. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions.</p>
