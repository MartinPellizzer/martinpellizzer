                    <h1>Cyathula prostrata var. lancifolia</h1>
<p>Cyathula prostrata var. lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in cup-like cyathia, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. The leaves are lanceolate, hence the specific epithet "lancifolia," and are usually covered in a waxy cuticle. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and wetlands.</p>
<p>The plant is noted for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive.</p>
