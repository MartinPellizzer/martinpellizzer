<p>Cheilanthes hieronymi, commonly known as the Hieronymi's rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in rocky, arid environments, often growing on limestone or sandstone. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are densely packed. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem.</p>
