                    <h1>Crocodeilanthe gustavo-romeroi</h1>
<p>Crocodeilanthe gustavo-romeroi, commonly known as the Gustavo-Romero's bryophyte, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Lejeuneaceae.</p>
<p>It is a liverwort, characterized by its small, flat, and often intricate leaf-like structures called thallus. This species is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as on rock surfaces or in humid forests. Its morphology includes a distinct thallus with a central axis and lateral lobes, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
