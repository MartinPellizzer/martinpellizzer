                    <h1>Corallorhiza vreelandii</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza vreelandii, commonly known as the Vreeland's beardtongue, is a species of orchid that lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on mycorrhizal fungi for its nutrition.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb that grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodlands. The plant produces tall, slender stems with whorls of pale pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its reliance on these fungi and its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
