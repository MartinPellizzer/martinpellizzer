                    <h1>Cycas parvula</h1>
<p>Cycas parvula, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, a feature common to cycads. Cycas parvula is adapted to grow in dry, well-drained soils and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
