                    <h1>Carpinus laxiflora f. lacera</h1>
<p>Carpinus laxiflora f. lacera, commonly known as the slender-flowered hornbeam, is a rare and distinctive variant of the hornbeam genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, slender leaves that are often twisted and have a delicate, lace-like appearance. This form is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands or along stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, oval berries.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
