                    <h1>Colobanthus nivicola</h1>
<p>Colobanthus nivicola, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a flowering plant native to the extreme environments of Antarctica and the southern regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils, often found on rocky outcrops and glacier margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the brief summer months. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to minimize water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Colobanthus nivicola plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its extreme habitat, providing food for local fauna and contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
