<p>Christiana macrodon, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. The plant's showy white flowers, which bloom at night, are a key feature, attracting pollinators such as bats and moths. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize the sediment in its aquatic habitat.</p>
<p>The leaves are thick and waxy, providing buoyancy and protection against herbivores.</p>
