<p>Carelia maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray leaves that are adapted to salty, windy environments. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its leaves have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss, and its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Carelia maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting coastal biodiversity.</p>
