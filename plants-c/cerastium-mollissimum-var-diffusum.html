                    <h1>Cerastium mollissimum var. diffusum</h1>
<p>Cerastium mollissimum var. diffusum, commonly known as velvet cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are soft and velvety to the touch. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are typically five-petaled. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
