<p>Chamaesyce microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed sand mat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Portulacaceae, which includes many species of flowering plants adapted to arid environments. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and they bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Chamaesyce microcephala is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along riverbanks and in desert scrub habitats.</p>
