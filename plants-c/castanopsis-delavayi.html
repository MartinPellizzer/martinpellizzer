<p>Castanopsis delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's tallowwood, is a deciduous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of southwest China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, heavy wood. The plant produces small, cup-shaped fruits that contain one or two seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests at higher elevations.</p>
<p>Castanopsis delavayi is valued for its ecological role and has limited commercial use due to its slow growth and hard wood.</p>
