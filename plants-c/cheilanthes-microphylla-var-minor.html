                    <h1>Cheilanthes microphylla var. minor</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes microphylla var. minor, commonly known as the lesser rock fern, is a compact, terrestrial fern native to arid and rocky environments in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, delicate fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin and a pale green to grayish-green coloration. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores water and nutrients. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>This variety is often found growing on limestone or sandstone, thriving in well-drained, sunny habitats.</p>
