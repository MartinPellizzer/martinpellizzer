<p>Calamus interruptus, commonly known as the interrupted horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are often ribbed and covered in small, scale-like structures.

<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living vascular plants.</p>
