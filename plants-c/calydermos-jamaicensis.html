                    <h1>Calydermos jamaicensis</h1>
<p>Calydermos jamaicensis, commonly known as Jamaican calydermos, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Jamaica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to the humid tropical climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Calydermos jamaicensis is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
