                    <h1>Cactus gabbii</h1>
<p>Cactus gabbii, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and prominent, spiny areoles that bear clusters of white flowers. The plant has a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The flowers, which bloom in spring, are a striking yellow or orange color, attracting pollinators like bees and birds.</p>
