<p>Ceropegia biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, tuberous stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale green, often with a distinctive hood-like structure. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a waxy texture, while its roots form a network that helps anchor it in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Ceropegia biflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to bloom in low-light conditions.</p>
