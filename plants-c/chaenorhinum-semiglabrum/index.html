                            <h1>Chaenorhinum Semiglabrum</h1>
<p>Chaenorhinum semiglabrum is a lesser-known flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family, known for its diverse and often strikingly colorful members. This annual herb is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, vibrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in supporting pollinators and adding biodiversity to gardens. Its resilience and adaptability make it a valuable addition to wildflower meadows and ecological restoration projects.</p>
