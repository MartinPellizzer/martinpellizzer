                    <h1>Carex lasiocarpa var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Carex lasiocarpa var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved haircap moss, is a perennial sedge native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, cylindrical leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, a common reproductive strategy among sedges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland or boggy areas.</p>
