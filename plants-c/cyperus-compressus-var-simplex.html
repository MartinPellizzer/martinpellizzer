                    <h1>Cyperus compressus var. simplex</h1>
<p>Cyperus compressus var. simplex, commonly known as slender flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. This species is often found in wetland habitats, including marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil.</p>
<p>The plant is generally considered a wetland indicator species due to its preference for moist to waterlogged soils.</p>
