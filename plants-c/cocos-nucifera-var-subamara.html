                    <h1>Cocos nucifera var. subamara</h1>
<p>Cocos nucifera var. subamara, commonly known as the dwarf coconut palm, is a variant of the coconut tree characterized by its shorter stature and compact growth habit.</p>

The plant is adapted to coastal and tropical environments, thriving in sandy soils and high humidity. Its leaves are broad and feather-like, contributing to its ornamental value in landscaping.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and as a hardy, low-maintenance plant in tropical gardens.</p>
