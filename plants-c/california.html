                    <h1>California</h1>
<p>California, commonly known as the "Golden State," is home to a diverse array of native plant species, many of which are adapted to its Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>The state's flora includes a wide range of chaparral, coastal scrub, and redwood forest ecosystems. Native plants such as the California poppy, coast live oak, and coast redwood are emblematic of the region's botanical diversity. Many of these plants have evolved to survive in dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>
<p>The unique combination of climate and geography has made California a hotspot for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
