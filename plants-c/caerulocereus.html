<p>Caerulocereus, commonly known as the blue nightshade cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom at night. The plant has spiny areoles and produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically green or red when mature. Caerulocereus thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its unique nocturnal blooming habit makes it a fascinating subject for both botanists and gardeners.</p>
