<p>Cerasus × yedoensis, commonly known as the Japanese cherry, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental value, particularly during the spring when it produces clusters of white or pink flowers. The tree typically grows to a height of 5–10 meters and has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The fruit, a small, red drupe, is edible but less commonly consumed compared to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
