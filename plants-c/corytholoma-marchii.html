                    <h1>Corytholoma marchii</h1>
<p>Corytholoma marchii, commonly known as the Marchii's corona, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the dense forests of Borneo and Sumatra. The plant is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped lip petal, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are typically pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Corytholoma marchii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
