                    <h1>Celsia daenzeri</h1>
<p>Celsia daenzeri, commonly known as the Daenzer's celsia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates, often in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, edible berries that are not commonly consumed by humans.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Celsia daenzeri is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
