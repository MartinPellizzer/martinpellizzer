                    <h1>Cypripedium hartwegii</h1>
<p>Cypripedium hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without being exposed to direct sun. Its leaves are usually broad and dark green, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
