                    <h1>Cuscuta kurdica</h1>
<p>Cuscuta kurdica, commonly known as the Kurdish dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like stem that wraps around its host. The plant is native to regions of the Middle East and Central Asia, including parts of Turkey and Iran. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new hosts effectively.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Cuscuta kurdica plays a role in ecological interactions and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
