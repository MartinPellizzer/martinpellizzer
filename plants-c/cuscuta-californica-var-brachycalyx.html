                    <h1>Cuscuta californica var. brachycalyx</h1>
<p>Cuscuta californica var. brachycalyx, commonly known as the California dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to California and is often found on shrubs and grasses. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can form dense infestations on susceptible plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host, making it a significant weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
