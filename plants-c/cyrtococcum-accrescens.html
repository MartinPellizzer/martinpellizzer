                    <h1>Cyrtococcum accrescens</h1>
<p>Cyrtococcum accrescens, commonly known as the creeping broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-green stems and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. It is found primarily in Europe and parts of Asia, where it attaches to various grasses and herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
