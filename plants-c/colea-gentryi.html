<p>Colea gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's colea, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its small, white flowers bloom in late spring, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
