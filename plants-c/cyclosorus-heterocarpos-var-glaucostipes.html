                    <h1>Cyclosorus heterocarpos var. glaucostipes</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus heterocarpos var. glaucostipes, commonly known as the blue-stemmed cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant is characterized by its distinctive blue-green stems and delicate, fan-shaped fronds. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
