                    <h1>Cactus phaeacanthus</h1>
<p>Cactus phaeacanthus, commonly known as the desert star cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a tall, columnar stem with a distinctive star-shaped pattern on its surface, which helps in reducing water loss through transpiration. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>The plant's shallow root system enables it to quickly absorb rainwater when it becomes available.</p>
