<p>Comanthosphace tosaensis, commonly known as the Tosa liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Comatophyceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, thalloid plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a complex thallus structure with distinct lobes and a central axis, characteristic of many liverworts. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its flattened, leaf-like structures for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Comanthosphace tosaensis is primarily found in East Asia, particularly in Japan, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates.</p>
