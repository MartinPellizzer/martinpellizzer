<p>Castilleja arachnoidea, commonly known as the spiderholly castilleja, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and often covered in a fine, hair-like structure.</p>
<p>Castilleja arachnoidea is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments.</p>
