                    <h1>Coussapoa macarenensis var. antioquiensis</h1>
<p>Coussapoa macarenensis var. antioquiensis, commonly known as the Antioquian fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate fronds with a unique, serrated edge. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees in its humid, shaded habitat. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of moss, which helps retain moisture in its cool, moist environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, this species is considered critically endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
