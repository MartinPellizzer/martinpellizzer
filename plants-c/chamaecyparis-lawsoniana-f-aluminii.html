                    <h1>Chamaecyparis lawsoniana f. aluminii</h1>
<p>Chamaecyparis lawsoniana f. aluminii, commonly known as the alpine Lawson cypress, is a rare horticultural form of the Lawson cypress.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, pyramidal growth habit and dense foliage. This variety is particularly valued for its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine conditions, including poor soil and high elevation. The leaves are scale-like and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its silver-gray bark.</p>
<p>It is often used in rock gardens and as a specimen plant due to its ornamental appeal and hardiness.</p>
