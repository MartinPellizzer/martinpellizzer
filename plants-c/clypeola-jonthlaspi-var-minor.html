                    <h1>Clypeola jonthlaspi var. minor</h1>
<p>Clypeola jonthlaspi var. minor, commonly known as the lesser clypeola, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the spring, and the plant produces small, spherical fruits that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
