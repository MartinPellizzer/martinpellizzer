                    <h1>Corallorhiza mertensiana</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza mertensiana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on mycorrhizal fungi for its nutrients, making it a myco-heterotroph. The plant has a slender, unbranched stem with a single, showy, pinkish-white flower that resembles a ghostly apparition. It thrives in shaded, moist hardwood forests and is often found growing through the leaves of other plants.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and conservation status, it is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
