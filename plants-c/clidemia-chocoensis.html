                    <h1>Clidemia chocoensis</h1>
<p>Clidemia chocoensis, commonly known as Choc√≥ mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its small, green leaves and showy, white or pink flowers. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain pollinators and birds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
