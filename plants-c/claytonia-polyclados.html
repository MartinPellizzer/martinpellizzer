                    <h1>Claytonia polyclados</h1>
<p>Claytonia polyclados, commonly known as the Sierra glacier plant, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Portulacaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, fleshy, pink or white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically succulent and covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Claytonia polyclados is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
