<p>Cheirinia nivalis, commonly known as the snowdrop, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, nodding flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and two to three white or greenish-white flowers per stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland, meadows, and alpine environments.</p>
<p>Cheirinia nivalis is known for its resilience to cold climates and is an important early indicator of spring in its native habitats.</p>
