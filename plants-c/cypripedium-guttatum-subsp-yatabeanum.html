<p>Cypripedium guttatum subsp.</p>
<p>yatabeanum, commonly known as the Yatabean lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to Japan. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch and a deep purple or reddish hue.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and the plant produces a single flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
