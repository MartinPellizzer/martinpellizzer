<p>Chamguava schippii, commonly known as the Schippi's guava, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Myrtaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Andean region of South America, specifically found in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and elliptical, glossy leaves. Its fruit is typically small, with a sweet and aromatic pulp, though it is not as widely cultivated as other guava species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chamguava schippii is considered a botanically significant and potentially endangered species.</p>
