                    <h1>Cryptomeria japonica var. spiralis</h1>
<p>Cryptomeria japonica var. spiralis, commonly known as the spiral cedar, is a unique variant of the Japanese cedar characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of branches.</p>
<p>This morphological feature gives the tree a striking, almost sculptural appearance, with branches curling in a helical pattern around the trunk. The plant is native to Japan and is typically found in mountainous regions where it thrives in cool, moist climates. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>The spiral cedar is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant.</p>
