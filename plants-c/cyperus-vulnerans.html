<p>Cyperus vulnerans, commonly known as the bleeding rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with cylindrical, often reddish stems. The plant is notable for its ability to exude a milky sap when injured, which can cause a staining effect, hence its common name. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along water bodies.</p>
<p>Cyperus vulnerans is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
