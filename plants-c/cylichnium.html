                    <h1>Cylichnium</h1>
<p>Cylichnium, commonly known as the sand spiker, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their slender, grass-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. They are typically found in sandy or coastal environments, where they thrive in well-drained soils. Cylichnium species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize sand dunes.</p>
<p>Their life cycle is adapted to harsh conditions, with some species being annuals that complete their growth cycle quickly in response to environmental cues.</p>
