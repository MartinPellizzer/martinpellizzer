<p>Cymbopogon refractus, commonly known as narrowleaf lemon grass, is a perennial grass native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stalks and aromatic, lemon-scented leaves that contain high concentrations of citral. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy areas. Its essential oils are widely used in perfumery and aromatherapy due to their pleasant fragrance and potential therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
