<p>Cordia grandis, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils, making it a common species in coastal mangrove forests. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by fleshy, red berries containing numerous seeds. Its roots form a complex network that helps stabilize coastal sediments and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Cordia grandis plays a vital role in marine and coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
