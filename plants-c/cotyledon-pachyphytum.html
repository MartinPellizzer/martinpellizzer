<p>Cotyledon pachyphytum, commonly known as the elephant's foot plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant has a unique, tree-like structure with a swollen, basal caudex that resembles an elephant's foot. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season.</p>
