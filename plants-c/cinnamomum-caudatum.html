                    <h1>Cinnamomum caudatum</h1>
<p>Cinnamomum caudatum, commonly known as the hairy cinnamon or wild cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, dark brown bark that resembles true cinnamon, though it is not related to the Cinnamomum verum species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and dark purple berries, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a pleasant, spicy aroma.</p>
<p>Cinnamomum caudatum thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks.</p>
