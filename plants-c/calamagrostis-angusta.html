<p>Calamagrostis angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf grass or silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often silvery-blue in color. The plant produces feathery, plume-like inflorescences that add ornamental value, especially in late summer and autumn. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
