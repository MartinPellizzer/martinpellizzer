<p>Cheilanthes firma, commonly known as the rigid lady fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and rocky habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its upright, stiff fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and can often be found growing on rock faces or in dry, shaded areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes firma is a hardy, low-maintenance plant often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to survive in harsh environments.</p>
