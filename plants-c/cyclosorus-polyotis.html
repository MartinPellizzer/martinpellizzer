                    <h1>Cyclosorus polyotis</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus polyotis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a delicate aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its small, spore-producing structures are arranged in clusters along the fronds, aiding in its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus polyotis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
