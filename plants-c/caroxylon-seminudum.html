                    <h1>Caroxylon seminudum</h1>
<p>Caroxylon seminudum, commonly known as the naked-seed tree, is a rare and unique plant native to the arid regions of western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, woody structure and the absence of leaves, which allows it to conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Caroxylon seminudum plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various desert organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
