<p>Cheirostylis eglandulosa, commonly known as the smooth-styled orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often near streams or in undergrowth. The plant features a slender rhizome and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, elongated spur. Its leaves are broad and ovate, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its lack of glandular structures on the stems, which is reflected in its scientific name.</p>
