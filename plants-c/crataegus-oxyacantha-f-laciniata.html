<p>Crataegus oxyacantha f. laciniata, commonly known as the shredded rosehip.</p>
<p>This plant is a cultivar of the common hawthorn, characterized by its finely lobed, almost serrated leaves that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. It produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. The plant is typically deciduous, shedding its leaves in winter, and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for small gardens or as a decorative hedge.</p>
