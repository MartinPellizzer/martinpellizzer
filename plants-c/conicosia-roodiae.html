The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the rainy season. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to survive.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sought-after species among collectors.</p>
