                    <h1>Cenchrus echinatus var. tribuloides</h1>
<p>Cenchrus echinatus var. tribuloides, commonly known as the roughhairs grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soil.</p>
<p>This variety is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock in dryland environments.</p>
