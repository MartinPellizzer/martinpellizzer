                    <h1>Conium dichotomum</h1>
<p>Conium dichotomum, commonly known as poison hemlock, is a biennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in umbrella-shaped umbels. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, particularly coniine, which can be fatal to humans and animals if ingested. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found along roadsides, in fields, and in waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is often mistaken for edible plants like parsley or carrots, making it a dangerous weed.</p>
