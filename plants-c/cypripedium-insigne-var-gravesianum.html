<p>Cypripedium insigne var. gravesianum, commonly known as the Graves' lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically a deep pink or red color. The plant has a pseudobulb structure and produces a single, fleshy leaf, adapting to its high-altitude, cool climate. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is highly valued for its ornamental beauty.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
