<p>Catopsis tripinnata, commonly known as the tripartite moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a distinct central axis and lateral branches, which are covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. Catopsis tripinnata is typically green to reddish in color, depending on environmental conditions, and reproduces via spores released from specialized structures called sporocarps.</p>
<p>This moss is an important component of tropical and subtropical ecosystems, contributing to soil stability and moisture retention.</p>
