                    <h1>Cardamine hirsuta var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Cardamine hirsuta var. intermedia, commonly known as the hairy watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features alternate, palmately lobed leaves with a distinctive hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in damp conditions. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress.</p>
