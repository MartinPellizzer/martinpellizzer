                    <h1>Caloplectus</h1>
<p>Caloplectus, commonly known as the golden cup, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange composite flowers that resemble small cups, hence their common name. Caloplectus species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. They are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Caloplectus acanthocarpus and Caloplectus coccineus, which are native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
