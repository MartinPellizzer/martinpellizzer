<p>Coccoloba laurifolia, commonly known as the laceleaf or red mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, almost lace-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, often in brackish or saltwater environments, making it an important component of mangrove ecosystems. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pink, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>Coccoloba laurifolia plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
