                    <h1>Cinnamomum carrierei</h1>
<p>Cinnamomum carrierei, commonly known as the Chinese cinnamon or Cinnamomum carri√©re, is a species of flowering plant in the Lauraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to southern China, particularly in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces, and thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. Its bark, similar to true cinnamon, contains essential oils and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>However, it is less commercially cultivated than other cinnamon species due to its limited yield and specific growing requirements.</p>
