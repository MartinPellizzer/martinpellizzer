                    <h1>Caralluma arachnoidea var. breviloba</h1>
<p>Caralluma arachnoidea var. breviloba, commonly known as the short-stalked hedgehog cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with short, cylindrical stems covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, adapting to its harsh, dry environment.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
