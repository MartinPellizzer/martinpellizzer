<p>Conocephalus peltatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, adapting to aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, arranged in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in shallow water.</p>
<p>Conocephalus peltatus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
