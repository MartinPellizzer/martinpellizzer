<p>Christensonella echinophyta, commonly known as the spiny scale plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which is known for its diverse and often ornamental species. The plant features a thick, fleshy stem covered in spiny, scale-like structures that provide protection against herbivores. Its leaves are typically small and often reduced, with the main photosynthetic function carried out by the stem.</p>
<p>Christensonella echinophyta is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stem to survive in dry conditions.</p>
