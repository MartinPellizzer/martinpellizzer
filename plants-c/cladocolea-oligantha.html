                    <h1>Cladocolea oligantha</h1>
<p>Cladocolea oligantha, commonly known as the slender cliff heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and small, urn-shaped flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to rocky or sandy coastal habitats. Its leaves are leathery and densely packed, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Cladocolea oligantha is often found in association with other endemic flora in its native range.</p>
