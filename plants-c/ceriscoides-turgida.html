<p>Ceriscoides turgida, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes spread along the water's surface, forming dense mats that provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The fronds are divided into small, delicate pinnae, which are covered in fine, hair-like structures that aid in water retention.</p>
