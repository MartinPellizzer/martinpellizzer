<p>Cycas tanqingii, commonly known as the Tanqing cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
