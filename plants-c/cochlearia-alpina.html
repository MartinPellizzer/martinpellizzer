                    <h1>Cochlearia alpina</h1>
<p>Cochlearia alpina, commonly known as the alpine cochlearia, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Cochlearia alpina is often found in meadows, scree slopes, and limestone habitats at high altitudes.</p>
