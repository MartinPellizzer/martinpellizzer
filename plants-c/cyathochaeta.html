                    <h1>Cyathochaeta</h1>
<p>Cyathochaeta, commonly known as the "butterfly flower," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their showy, butterfly-like flowers that often display vibrant colors such as red, yellow, and orange. The inflorescence is typically a cyathium, which is a cup-like structure that holds the flowers and is often mistaken for a single bloom. Cyathochaeta species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and the Americas.</p>
<p>They have hairy stems and leaves, and their flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, especially bees and butterflies.</p>
