<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and shallow water areas. Its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
