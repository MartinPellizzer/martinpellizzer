<p>Cardamine macrophylla var. appendiculata, commonly known as the clustered water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as streams, ponds, and wetlands. The plant features finely divided, floating or submerged leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its elongated leaf stalks and is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic invertebrates and as an indicator of clean water conditions.</p>
