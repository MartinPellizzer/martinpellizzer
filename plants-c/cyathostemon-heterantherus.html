                    <h1>Cyathostemon heterantherus</h1>
<p>Cyathostemon heterantherus, commonly known as the variable anther plant, is a unique member of the Onagraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, featuring a cup-shaped hypanthium that encloses the reproductive organs. The plant exhibits a high degree of morphological variation, particularly in the arrangement and number of stamens. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, across parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model species for studying floral evolution and pollination mechanisms.</p>
