                    <h1>Cardopatium amethystinum</h1>
<p>Cardopatium amethystinum, commonly known as the amethyst false nettle, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or rocky areas.</p>
<p>Despite its common name, it is not related to true nettles and lacks the stinging hairs typical of the genus Urtica.</p>
