                    <h1>Clidemia glabriflora</h1>
<p>Clidemia glabriflora, commonly known as the smooth-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Onagraceae family and typically grows on the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually opposite and ovate, with a glossy surface that aids in photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Clidemia glabriflora plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain insects and birds.</p>
