                    <h1>Cryptostylis clemensii</h1>
<p>Cryptostylis clemensii, commonly known as the Clemens' spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, narrow leaves and clustered, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in understorey vegetation. It has a short flowering period, usually in late winter to early spring, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
