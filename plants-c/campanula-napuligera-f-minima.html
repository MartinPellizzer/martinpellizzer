                    <h1>Campanula napuligera f. minima</h1>
<p>Campanula napuligera f. minima, commonly known as the miniature bellflower, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, typical of many alpine species. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
