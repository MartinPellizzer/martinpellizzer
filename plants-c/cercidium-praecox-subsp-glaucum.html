<p>Cercidium praecox subsp.</p>
<p>glaucum, commonly known as the silverleaf bur sage, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps it conserve water in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rocky landscapes.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its glaucous (waxy) coating on the leaves, which enhances its ability to withstand harsh desert conditions.</p>
