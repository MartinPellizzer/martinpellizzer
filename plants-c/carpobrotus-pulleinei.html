<p>Carpobrotus pulleinei, commonly known as the Pacific coast fig, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and coastal environments. The plant produces vibrant orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It is often found growing in sandy soils along the coastline, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it is also cultivated in gardens in similar climates.</p>
