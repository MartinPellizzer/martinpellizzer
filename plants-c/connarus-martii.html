                    <h1>Connarus martii</h1>
<p>Connarus martii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a slow-growing, deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark brown bark and small, leathery leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. Its wood is extremely hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and furniture.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
