<p>Caragana brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved shrub vetch, is a deciduous shrub native to Central Asia and parts of Russia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and its yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Caragana brevifolia is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh landscapes.</p>
