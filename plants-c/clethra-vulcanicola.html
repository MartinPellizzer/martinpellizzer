<p>It is characterized by its small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a humid, shaded environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
