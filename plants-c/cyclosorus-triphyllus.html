<p>Cyclosorus triphyllus, commonly known as the three-leaved water clover, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating on the surface of freshwater habitats. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, streams, and wetlands. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for microorganisms.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus triphyllus is primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
