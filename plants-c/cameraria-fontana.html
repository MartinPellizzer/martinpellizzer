                    <h1>Cameraria fontana</h1>
<p>Cameraria fontana, commonly known as the Fontana leaf miner, is a small moth species belonging to the family Lyonetiidae.</p>
<p>Its larvae are leaf miners, creating distinctive serpentine trails on the leaves of their host plants, primarily species of the genus Ficus. The adult moths are tiny, with wingspan less than 5 millimeters, and are often overlooked due to their minute size. The plant's botanical significance lies in its role as a host for this species, contributing to the ecological dynamics of tropical and subtropical ecosystems.</p>
<p>Cameraria fontana is widely distributed in regions with warm climates, where it thrives in humid environments.</p>
