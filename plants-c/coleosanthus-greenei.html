                    <h1>Coleosanthus greenei</h1>
<p>Coleosanthus greenei, commonly known as the Greene's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghostly appearance, with pale, translucent flowers that resemble translucent leaves. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns that help in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
