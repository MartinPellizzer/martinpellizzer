<p>Carduus carlinoides subsp.</p>
<p>carlinoides, commonly known as the Carlin thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust, upright stem covered in coarse, spiny hairs, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a rough, waxy texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands.</p>
<p>Its spiny structure and toxic milky sap make it a defensive adaptation against herbivores.</p>
