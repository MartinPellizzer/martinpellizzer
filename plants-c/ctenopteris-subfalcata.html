                    <h1>Ctenopteris subfalcata</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris subfalcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches itself to rocks or submerged structures. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats that provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in freshwater ecosystems.</p>
