<p>Cheilanthes stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and narrow, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is often found in crevices or on exposed rock faces. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to anchor firmly in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes stenophylla is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in xerophytic habitats.</p>
