<p>Cuphea arenarioides var. myriophylloides, commonly known as the desert cuphea, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its striking, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces showy, clustered blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
