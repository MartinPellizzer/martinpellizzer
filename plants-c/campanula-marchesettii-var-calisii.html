                    <h1>Campanula marchesettii var. calisii</h1>
<p>Campanula marchesettii var. calisii, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions.</p>
