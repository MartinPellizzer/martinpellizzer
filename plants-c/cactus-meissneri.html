                    <h1>Cactus meissneri</h1>
<p>Cactus meissneri, commonly known as the Meissner's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically ribbed and covered in sparse, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often nocturnal in bloom. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its succulent stems that store water.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
