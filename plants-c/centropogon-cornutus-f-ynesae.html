                    <h1>Centropogon cornutus f. ynesae</h1>
<p>Centropogon cornutus f. ynesae, commonly known as the Ynesa horned grass, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant within the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which features elongated, curved bracts that resemble horns, giving it its common name. This plant is native to specific regions of South America, particularly in Brazil, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Centropogon cornutus f. ynesae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
