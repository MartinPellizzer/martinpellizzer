                    <h1>Cardamine zhejiangensis</h1>
<p>Cardamine zhejiangensis, commonly known as Zhejiang watercress, is a rare and delicate member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Zhejiang Province in eastern China, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a smooth, glossy surface and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its roots are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to watercress, making it a traditional food in local cuisines.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some conservation efforts.</p>
