                    <h1>Ceratostylis selebensis</h1>
<p>Ceratostylis selebensis, commonly known as the Borneo spider orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to white flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often epiphytic on trees or terrestrial in moist, leaf-littered areas. Its flowers bloom during the wet season and are pollinated by specific insects, contributing to its ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Ceratostylis selebensis is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
