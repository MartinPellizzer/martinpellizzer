                    <h1>Chamaecrista neesiana var. subnitida</h1>
<p>Chamaecrista neesiana var. subnitida, commonly known as the velvetleaf cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with a velvety texture and bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is a legume, meaning it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a valuable forage crop and a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
