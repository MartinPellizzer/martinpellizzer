                    <h1>Chamaepeuce alpini var. camptolepis</h1>
<p>Chamaepeuce alpini var. camptolepis, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a low-growing rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in many areas.</p>
