                    <h1>Calligonum setosum</h1>
<p>Calligonum setosum, commonly known as the woolly saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Calligonum setosum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion.</p>
