                    <h1>Cheilanthes micrantha</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and leathery, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its fronds, which are typically clustered near the leaf tips. It thrives in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions due to its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy leaves.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes micrantha is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that is often used in xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
