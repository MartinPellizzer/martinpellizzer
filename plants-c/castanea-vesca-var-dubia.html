                    <h1>Castanea vesca var. dubia</h1>
<p>Castanea vesca var. dubia, commonly known as the Persian chestnut.</p>
<p>This variant is a less common subspecies of the common horse chestnut, characterized by its smaller, spiny fruits and distinct leaf morphology. It is native to regions of the Middle East and Central Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces edible nuts, though they are often more bitter than those of the common horse chestnut.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for horticulturists and botanists studying plant diversity.</p>
