<p>Chorizanthe pauciflora, commonly known as the spiny flax or desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers and bristly, spiny leaves. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Chorizanthe pauciflora is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects.</p>
