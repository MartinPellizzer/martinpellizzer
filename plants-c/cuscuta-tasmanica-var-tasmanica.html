                    <h1>Cuscuta tasmanica var. tasmanica</h1>
<p>Cuscuta tasmanica var. tasmanica, commonly known as the Tasmanian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, attaching itself with specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a sprawling, vine-like growth habit. It is often found growing on the stems of other plants in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable host species, making it an ecologically significant yet often overlooked component of its ecosystem.</p>
