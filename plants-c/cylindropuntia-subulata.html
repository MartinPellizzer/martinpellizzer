                    <h1>Cylindropuntia subulata</h1>
<p>Cylindropuntia subulata, commonly known as the silver cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, spine-tipped stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by various insects and birds. Its adaptations to arid environments include succulent stems for water storage and a shallow root system for quick absorption of rainwater.</p>
<p>The silver cholla is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
