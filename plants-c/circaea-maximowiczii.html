                    <h1>Circaea maximowiczii</h1>
<p>Circaea maximowiczii, commonly known as the Siberian white bead, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the cold climates of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Circaea maximowiczii is often found in alpine and subarctic regions, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
