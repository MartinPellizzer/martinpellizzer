                    <h1>Carpoceras</h1>
<p>Carpoceras, commonly known as the "skeleton flower," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, papery bracts that resemble the skeletal structure of a flower, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, where it has adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Carpoceras species often have small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by showy, modified leaves.</p>
<p>These plants are of interest to botanists due to their specialized morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
