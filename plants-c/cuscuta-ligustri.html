                    <h1>Cuscuta ligustri</h1>
<p>Cuscuta ligustri, commonly known as dodder of the elm, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is often found on elms, hawthorns, and other woody species. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means.</p>
<p>Cuscuta ligustri is considered a weed in agricultural and forest settings due to its ability to weaken host plants.</p>
