                    <h1>Cactus ficus</h1>
<p>Cactus ficus, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a unique hybrid plant that combines characteristics of both cacti and ficus species.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, similar to true cacti, while its leaves are often reduced to spines, a trait shared with many desert plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that can range in color from white to yellow. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture efficiently, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Despite its name, it is not a true cactus but a member of the Moraceae family, which includes figs.</p>
