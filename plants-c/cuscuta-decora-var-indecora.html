                    <h1>Cuscuta decora var. indecora</h1>
<p>Cuscuta decora var. indecora, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or damage its host, making it a concern in agricultural and natural ecosystems.</p>
