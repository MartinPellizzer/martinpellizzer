                    <h1>Conophytum semivestitum</h1>
<p>Conophytum semivestitum, commonly known as the "Cape Flax" or "Cape Fossils," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
