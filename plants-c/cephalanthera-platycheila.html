<p>Cephalanthera platycheila, commonly known as the broad-leafed lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the forests of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is a terrestrial orchid with a rhizomatous root system and lacks true leaves, instead having leaf-like structures called phylloclades. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands with rich, organic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in many regions.</p>
