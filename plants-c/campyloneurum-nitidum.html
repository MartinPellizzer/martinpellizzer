                    <h1>Campyloneurum nitidum</h1>
<p>Campyloneurum nitidum, commonly known as the smooth shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and form dense mats, which help in stabilizing the soil.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
