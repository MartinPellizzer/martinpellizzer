<p>Callitriche palustris var. stenocarpa, commonly known as narrow-fruited water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to wetlands and slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water, often forming dense mats on the surface or submerged vegetation. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. Its flowers are tiny, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often floating on the water's surface.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its narrower fruits compared to the typical form of Callitriche palustris.</p>
