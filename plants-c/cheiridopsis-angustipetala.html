<p>Cheiridopsis angustipetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
