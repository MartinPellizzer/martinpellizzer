                    <h1>Chlorospatha callejasii</h1>
<p>Chlorospatha callejasii, commonly known as the Calleja's green fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or pale green spores. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studying evolutionary adaptations in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
