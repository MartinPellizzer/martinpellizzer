<p>Christopteris eberhardtii, commonly known as the Eberhardt's rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as broccoli and cabbage. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The leaves are basal, lobed, and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
