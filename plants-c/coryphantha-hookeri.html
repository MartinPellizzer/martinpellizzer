<p>Coryphantha hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's milk barrel cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular plant with a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its spines are relatively short and cylindrical, providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Coryphantha hookeri is well adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, making it a hardy choice for desert gardens.</p>
