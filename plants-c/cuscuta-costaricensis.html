                    <h1>Cuscuta costaricensis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves attaching to host plants through specialized haustoria. The plant is native to Central America and is often found growing on various shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to its host plants, affecting their growth and survival.</p>
