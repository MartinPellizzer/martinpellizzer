                    <h1>Cuscuta canariensis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta canariensis, commonly known as the Canary dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to the Canary Islands and parts of Africa, and it often infests crops and wild plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural and ornamental plants.</p>
