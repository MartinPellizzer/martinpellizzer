                    <h1>Cuscuta planiflora var. bullata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta planiflora var. bullata, commonly known as the bulbous dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
