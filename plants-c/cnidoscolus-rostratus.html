<p>Cnidoscolus rostratus, commonly known as the spiny nightshade, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. It contains toxic compounds, including bufotenin, which makes it potentially harmful to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Due to its defensive spines and toxic properties, it is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
