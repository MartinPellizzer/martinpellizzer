                    <h1>Cuscuta mantiqueirana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta mantiqueirana, commonly known as the Brazilian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving both seed and vegetative propagation. The plant's stems are wiry and covered in fine, thread-like structures that allow it to adhere to and extract nutrients from its host. It is native to South America and is often found on various shrubs and trees.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
