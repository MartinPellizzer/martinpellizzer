                    <h1>Cormus trilobata</h1>
<p>Cormus trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed corm, is a unique plant characterized by its specialized underground storage structures called corms.</p>
<p>These corms are thickened stem bases that store nutrients, allowing the plant to survive adverse conditions. The plant typically features trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet having three distinct lobes, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Cormus trilobata is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
