<p>Combretum gracile var. gracile, commonly known as the slender flame bush, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its woody stems are often branched and can develop a reddish hue as they mature.</p>
