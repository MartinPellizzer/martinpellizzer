                    <h1>Calligonum × leucacanthum</h1>
<p>Calligonum × leucacanthum, commonly known as the silverleaf shrub, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Calligonum leptophyllum and Calligonum leucacanthum.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, deciduous shrub characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which provides a striking visual contrast against its green stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and erosion control in dry landscapes.</p>
