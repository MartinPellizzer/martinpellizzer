<p>Caladenia petrensis, commonly known as the Western Plains Spider-orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the western regions of New South Wales, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, spider-like appearance with a single, erect stem and a single, intricately patterned flower. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a vivid pink or purple flower with a distinctive, narrow lip. It grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open woodlands or grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
