<p>Cystopteris fragilis subsp.</p>
<p>eufragilis, commonly known as the brittle shield fern, is a small, delicate fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fragile, pinnately compound fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, leathery texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
