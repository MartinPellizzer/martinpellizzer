<p>Calycadenia pauciflora var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows from a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are usually yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits called cypselae.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its delicate appearance and adaptability to extreme desert conditions.</p>
