The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky streambanks. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a delicate, fern-like appearance, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, alkaline conditions, making it an indicator plant for limestone-rich habitats.</p>
