                    <h1>Coryphantha kracikii</h1>
<p>Coryphantha kracikii, commonly known as the Kracikâ€™s hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, spineless cactus with a globular or cylindrical shape, often covered in white or pale green tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is relatively easy to care for in arid climates.</p>
