                    <h1>Cuscuta peruviana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta peruviana, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves attaching to host plants through specialized haustoria. This species is native to South America and is often found growing on various host plants such as grasses and shrubs. Its rapid growth and lack of independent photosynthesis make it a significant challenge in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features are closely tied to its parasitic nature and specialized adaptations for nutrient uptake.</p>
