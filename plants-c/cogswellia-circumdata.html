                    <h1>Cogswellia circumdata</h1>
<p>Cogswellia circumdata, commonly known as the spiral leaf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiraling arrangement of leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, a trait typical of cycads, which are gymnosperms. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Cogswellia circumdata is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
