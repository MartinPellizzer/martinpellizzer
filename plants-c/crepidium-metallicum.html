                    <h1>Crepidium metallicum</h1>
<p>Crepidium metallicum, commonly known as the metallic orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique metallic sheen on its leaves and flowers, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and often lack the typical showy petals seen in many orchid species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Crepidium metallicum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
