                    <h1>Cypripedium lawrenceanum var. hyeanum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium lawrenceanum var. hyeanum, commonly known as the Korean lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to anchor firmly in its habitat while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
