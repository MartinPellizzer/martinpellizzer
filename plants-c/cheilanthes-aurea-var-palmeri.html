                    <h1>Cheilanthes aurea var. palmeri</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes aurea var. palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's rockcap, is a perennial fern native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, silky coating. The plant thrives in rocky soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
