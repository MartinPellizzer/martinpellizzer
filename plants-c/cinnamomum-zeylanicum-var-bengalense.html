                    <h1>Cinnamomum zeylanicum var. bengalense</h1>
<p>Cinnamomum zeylanicum var. bengalense, commonly known as Indian cinnamon or Ceylon cinnamon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Sri Lanka and parts of southern India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic bark, which is harvested for its essential oils and medicinal properties. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by oval, dark blue berries containing winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a distinct aromatic scent when crushed.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the more widely known Cinnamomum zeylanicum, but it is often considered a subspecies with slightly different botanical features.</p>
