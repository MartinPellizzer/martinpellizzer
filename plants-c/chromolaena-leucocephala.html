                    <h1>Chromolaena leucocephala</h1>
<p>Chromolaena leucocephala, commonly known as whitehead grass, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that grows up to 2 meters tall, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves and showy white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, three-lobed fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in new environments. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation, it is considered a weed in many regions.</p>
