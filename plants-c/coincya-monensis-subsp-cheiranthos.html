<p>Coincya monensis subsp.</p>
<p>cheiranthos, commonly known as the cheiranthos water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that form a rosette pattern on the water surface.</p>
<p>The plant has four small, heart-shaped leaves arranged in a whorl, which are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats and is adapted to low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
