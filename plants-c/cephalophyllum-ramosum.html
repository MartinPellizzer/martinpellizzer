                    <h1>Cephalophyllum ramosum</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum ramosum, commonly known as the branched crownplant, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and its ability to store water in its fleshy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and protecting it from herbivores.</p>
<p>Cephalophyllum ramosum thrives in arid environments and is often found in rocky soils.</p>
