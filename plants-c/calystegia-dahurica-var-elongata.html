                    <h1>Calystegia dahurica var. elongata</h1>
<p>Calystegia dahurica var. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed bindweed, is a climbing vine native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces trumpet-shaped, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a strong, persistent root system and can become invasive in certain environments. Its stems are hairy and capable of twining around supports, allowing it to climb and spread rapidly.</p>
<p>It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and forest edges.</p>
