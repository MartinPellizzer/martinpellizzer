                    <h1>Ctenopteris longipinnata</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris longipinnata, commonly known as the long-pinnate sea palm, is a marine fern belonging to the family Ctenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically found in shallow coastal waters. The plant thrives in intertidal zones, where it attaches itself to rocks using a central rhizome. Its fronds are often partially submerged and exhibit a unique branching pattern that distinguishes it from other marine flora.</p>
<p>Ctenopteris longipinnata plays a role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
