                    <h1>Calanthe alpina var. keshabii</h1>
<p>Calanthe alpina var. keshabii, commonly known as the Keshabii calanthe, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade, making it a challenging but rewarding species for cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
