<p>Cactus elegans, commonly known as the elegant cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach heights of up to three meters. The plant features spiny areoles and produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Cactus elegans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-water conditions.</p>
