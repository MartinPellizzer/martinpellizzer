<p>Caragana opulens, commonly known as the peashrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the steppes and semi-deserts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often divided into numerous small, linear leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, followed by pea-like pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Caragana opulens is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion and is used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
