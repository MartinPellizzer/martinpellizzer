                    <h1>Caralluma solenophora</h1>
<p>Caralluma solenophora, commonly known as the Indian date cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, adapted to its harsh, dry environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Caralluma solenophora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in herbal medicine.</p>
