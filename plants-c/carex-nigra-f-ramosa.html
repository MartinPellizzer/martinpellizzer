<p>It is characterized by its dark green, grass-like foliage and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
