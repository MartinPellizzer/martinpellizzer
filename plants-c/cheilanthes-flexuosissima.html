                    <h1>Cheilanthes flexuosissima</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes flexuosissima, commonly known as the flexible rockcap, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizome and its ability to thrive in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its lanceolate, leathery fronds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This fern is often found growing on limestone or shale, making it a common sight in desert and semi-desert regions.</p>
