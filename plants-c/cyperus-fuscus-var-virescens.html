                    <h1>Cyperus fuscus var. virescens</h1>
<p>Cyperus fuscus var. virescens, commonly known as the green tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways, preferring moist to aquatic conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its triangular stems and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits.</p>
