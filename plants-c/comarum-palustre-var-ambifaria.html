<p>Comarum palustre var. ambifaria, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features elongated, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure supports its role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various organisms.</p>
