                    <h1>Carpodiptera ameliae</h1>
<p>Carpodiptera ameliae, commonly known as the Amelia's ghost fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, typically growing on rocky outcrops or in dense forest understories. The plant features intricate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom, giving it a ghostly appearance. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, requiring specific pollinators for successful fertilization.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
