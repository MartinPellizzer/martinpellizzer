                    <h1>Colymbada haenseleri</h1>
<p>Colymbada haenseleri, commonly known as the Henseler's water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to freshwater wetlands in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted for efficient light absorption in water. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize sediment in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Colymbada haenseleri is valued for its ecological role in water ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens.</p>
