                    <h1>Celsia caduca</h1>
<p>Celsia caduca, commonly known as the deciduous celsia, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow before shedding in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a unique addition to botanical gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
