<p>Capsella longirostris, commonly known as the long-beaked catchfly, is a flowering plant in the family Caryophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
