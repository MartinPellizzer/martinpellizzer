                    <h1>Corytholoma verticillatum</h1>
<p>Corytholoma verticillatum, commonly known as the spiral leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in groups known as sori. Its leaves are usually leathery and dark green, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Corytholoma verticillatum is often found growing in shaded, humid environments such as forests or along stream banks.</p>
