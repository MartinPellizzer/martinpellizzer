                    <h1>Cephalophyllum compactum</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum compactum, commonly known as the compact cushion plant, is a unique succulent native to the rocky habitats of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a dense, low-growing rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the cooler months. Its compact form and ability to form clumps make it an attractive addition to rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival.</p>
