<p>Carex × toezensis, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a member of the Carex genus in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and pond edges. The plant features dense clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, Carex × toezensis is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
