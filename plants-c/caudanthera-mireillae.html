                    <h1>Caudanthera mireillae</h1>
<p>Caudanthera mireillae, commonly known as the Mireillae's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has a unique adaptation of forming a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
