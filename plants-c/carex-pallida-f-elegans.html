                    <h1>Carex pallida f. elegans</h1>
<p>Carex pallida f. elegans, commonly known as the pale sedge, is a variant of the pale sedge species native to North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Carex pallida f. elegans is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and aesthetic appeal.</p>
