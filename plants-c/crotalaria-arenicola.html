<p>Crotalaria arenicola, commonly known as the sand flat sida, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Crotalaria arenicola plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
