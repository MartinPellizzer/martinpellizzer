<p>Caralluma hottentotorum var. tubata, commonly known as the tubular nightshade, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, often blooming at night. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, and it has a spiny appearance, which helps deter herbivores.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping.</p>
