                    <h1>Cactus echinata</h1>
<p>Cactus echinata, commonly known as the spiny cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny exterior. Its spines, which are modified leaves, provide protection against herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Cactus echinata is often used in traditional medicine and is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
