                    <h1>Colutea arborescens var. brevidentata</h1>
<p>Colutea arborescens var. brevidentata, commonly known as the short-toothed broomrape, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and absence of true leaves. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and forest edges.</p>
<p>Its small, spiny pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats.</p>
