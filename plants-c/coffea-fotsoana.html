<p>Coffea fotsoana, commonly known as the Fotsoana coffee plant, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1â€“2 meters. The plant produces small, white flowers that give way to red, fleshy berries containing the seeds used for coffee. Its leaves are elliptical and have a glossy appearance, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, Coffea fotsoana is considered a rare and potentially valuable species in the coffee world.</p>
