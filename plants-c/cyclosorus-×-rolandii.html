                    <h1>Cyclosorus × rolandii</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus × rolandii, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Cyclosorus australis and Cyclosorus rotundifolius.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that form a rosette structure. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually rounded or heart-shaped, with a smooth or slightly lobed margin.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus × rolandii is often used in ecological studies to understand hybridization and speciation in aquatic plants.</p>
