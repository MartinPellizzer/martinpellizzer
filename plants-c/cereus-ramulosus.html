<p>Cereus ramulosus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers are short-lived, often fading by dawn, which is a unique feature of this species.</p>
