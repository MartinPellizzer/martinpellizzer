<p>Cenchrus rufescens, commonly known as red sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale to reddish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant in dryland environments.</p>
