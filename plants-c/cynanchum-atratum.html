                    <h1>Cynanchum atratum</h1>
<p>Cynanchum atratum, commonly known as black swallowwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its milky sap and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in woodland habitats and has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky, hair-like structures, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Cynanchum atratum is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
