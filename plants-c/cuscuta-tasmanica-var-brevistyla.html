                    <h1>Cuscuta tasmanica var. brevistyla</h1>
<p>Cuscuta tasmanica var. brevistyla, commonly known as the Tasmanian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Tasmania.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, attaching itself with specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that twine around its host. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
