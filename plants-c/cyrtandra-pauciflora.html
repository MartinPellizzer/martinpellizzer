<p>Cyrtandra pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered cyrtandra, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family, native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories and is often found in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
