<p>Carex korkischkoae, commonly known as the Korkischko sedge, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers, typical of many sedges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
