                    <h1>Cuscuta racemosa var. minuta</h1>
<p>Cuscuta racemosa var. minuta, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that twine around its hosts. The plant is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are tiny and can remain viable in the soil for many years.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
