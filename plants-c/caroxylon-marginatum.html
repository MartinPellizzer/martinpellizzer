                    <h1>Caroxylon marginatum</h1>
<p>Caroxylon marginatum, commonly known as the marginated caroxylon, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves with distinct margins that are often curled or fringed. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, humid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Caroxylon marginatum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
