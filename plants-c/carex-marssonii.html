<p>Carex marssonii, commonly known as the Marsson's sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Carex marssonii is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in wet conditions and support local biodiversity.</p>
