<p>Crataegus venusta, commonly known as the beautiful hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and showy white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits called pomes, which are edible but often considered tart. Crataegus venusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds.</p>
<p>Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it thrives in a variety of soil types once established.</p>
