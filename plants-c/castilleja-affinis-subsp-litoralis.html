<p>Castilleja affinis subsp.</p>
<p>litoralis, commonly known as the coastal castilleja, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific coast of North America. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in coastal grasslands and dunes, thriving in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
