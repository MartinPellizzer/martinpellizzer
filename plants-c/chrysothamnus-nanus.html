<p>Chrysothamnus nanus, commonly known as the dwarf goldenbush, is a small, mat-forming shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is characterized by its dense, yellow-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in open, spherical inflorescences. It has silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat.</p>
<p>Chrysothamnus nanus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
