                            <h1>Corneria Cornwalliana</h1>
<p>Cornwall's cornflower, scientifically known as Corneria cornwalliana, is a rare and delicate wildflower native to the rugged landscapes of Cornwall, England. This species thrives in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky outcrops, where it blooms with striking blue and purple petals during the summer months. Despite its beauty, the cornflower faces increasing threats from habitat loss and climate change, making it a symbol of ecological fragility. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and restore its natural habitat, ensuring its survival for future generations. As a unique emblem of Cornwall's natural heritage, the cornflower captures the essence of the region's wild and untamed landscapes.</p>
