<p>Cephalantheropsis, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, helmet-like flower structure, which gives it its common name. The plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Cephalantheropsis species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks rather than in soil.</p>
<p>They are known for their delicate, fragrant blooms that often appear in late summer or early autumn.</p>
