<p>Carex thulensis, commonly known as the Thule sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or wetland habitats. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environments.</p>
<p>Carex thulensis is adapted to cold climates and can survive in areas with short growing seasons.</p>
