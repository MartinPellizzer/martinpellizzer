<p>Cherleria laricifolia subsp.</p>
<p>laricifolia, commonly known as the silver fir leaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
