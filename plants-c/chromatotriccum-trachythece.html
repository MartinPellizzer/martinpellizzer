<p>Chromatotriccum trachythece, commonly known as the rough-leaved lichen, is a member of the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen characterized by its loosely branched, lobed thallus that is typically grayish to brown in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and cyanobacteria, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. Its surface is often covered with isidiate and rhizinate structures, which aid in attachment and nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found on tree bark and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
