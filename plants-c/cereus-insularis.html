                    <h1>Cereus insularis</h1>
<p>Cereus insularis, commonly known as the Socotra cactus, is a unique species native to the island of Socotra in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a ribbed structure that helps it store water. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a trait common among many cacti adapted to arid environments. Its stems are covered in sharp, cylindrical spines that provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Cereus insularis is well-suited to extreme conditions, thriving in hot, dry climates with minimal rainfall.</p>
