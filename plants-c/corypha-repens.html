                    <h1>Corypha repens</h1>
<p>Corypha repens, commonly known as the walking palm, is a unique monocot native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem that grows upright and can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces a single, large inflorescence at the top, which consists of both male and female flowers. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, adapted to its tropical environment.</p>
<p>Despite its palm-like appearance, it is not a true palm but belongs to the Arecaceae family.</p>
