                    <h1>Convolvulus tiliaceus</h1>
<p>Convolvulus tiliaceus, commonly known as the white morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
