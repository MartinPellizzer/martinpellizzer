The plant is native to the mountainous regions of southern Japan, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. It produces small, clustered flowers followed by hard, woody fruits containing single seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
