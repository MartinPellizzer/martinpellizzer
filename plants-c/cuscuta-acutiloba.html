                    <h1>Cuscuta acutiloba</h1>
<p>Cuscuta acutiloba, commonly known as the sharp-pointed dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through contact with the host's surface. It is commonly found in agricultural fields and gardens, where it can cause significant damage to crops.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in many regions.</p>
