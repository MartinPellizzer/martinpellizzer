<p>Conomorpha rigida, commonly known as the rigid conomorpha, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its woody stems and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a typical feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Conomorpha rigida is native to parts of Africa and is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils.</p>
