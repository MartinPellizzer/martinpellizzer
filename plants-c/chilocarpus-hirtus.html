<p>Chilocarpus hirtus, commonly known as the hairy chilocarpus, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name and helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrublands and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
