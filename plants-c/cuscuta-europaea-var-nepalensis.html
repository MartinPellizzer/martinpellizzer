<p>Cuscuta europaea var. nepalensis, commonly known as the Himalayan dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is typically found in temperate regions of the Himalayas and is often seen parasitizing shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and native vegetation.</p>
