                    <h1>Cuscuta chinensis var. ciliaris</h1>
<p>Cuscuta chinensis var. ciliaris, commonly known as the Chinese dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that缠绕 (twine) around its host for attachment. The plant is native to Asia and is often found growing on crops such as soybeans and cotton. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its invasive potential in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
