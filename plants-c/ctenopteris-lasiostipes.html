                    <h1>Ctenopteris lasiostipes</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris lasiostipes, commonly known as the hairy sea palm, is a species of fern native to the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often hairy fronds that are adapted to thrive in humid, saline environments. The plant typically grows in intertidal zones, where it tolerates periodic submersion and exposure to saltwater. Its rhizomes form dense clusters, anchoring it to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are often divided into narrow segments, contributing to its unique appearance and ecological role in coastal ecosystems.</p>
