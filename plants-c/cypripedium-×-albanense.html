                    <h1>Cypripedium × albanense</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × albanense, commonly known as the Albanian lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the Balkan region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often in mountainous areas. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
