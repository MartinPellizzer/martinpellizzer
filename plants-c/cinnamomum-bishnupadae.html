<p>Cinnamomum bishnupadae, commonly known as Bishnupada cinnamon, is a rare and endangered species native to the Eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown bark, which is used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Its leaves are elliptical, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it faces significant conservation challenges.</p>
