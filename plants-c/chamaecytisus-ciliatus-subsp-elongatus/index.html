                            <h1>Chamaecytisus Ciliatus Subsp. Elongatus</h1>
<p>Chamaecytisus ciliatus subsp. elongatus is a unique shrub native to the Mediterranean region known for its striking pink and white flowers. This subspecies is characterized by its elongated leaves and vigorous growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and rocky environments. Its ability to attract pollinators and its drought tolerance contribute to its ecological importance. Despite its beauty, it requires careful pruning to maintain its shape and prevent overgrowth.</p>
