<p>Cactus ottonis, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and dense covering of spines, which protect it from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments.</p>
<p>Cactus ottonis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
