                    <h1>Chlorophytum aridum</h1>
<p>Chlorophytum aridum, commonly known as the desert spider plant, is a succulent native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features thin, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers on slender stems, typically during the rainy season. It is adapted to survive in low-water environments with well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening in dry climates.</p>
