<p>Cyathula madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the genus Cyathula. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
