<p>Catasetum fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed cattleya, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces specialized structures called resupinate petals and sepals, which are typical of the orchid family. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Catasetum fimbriatum thrives in warm, humid environments with bright but indirect light.</p>
