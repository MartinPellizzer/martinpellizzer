                    <h1>Cycas pluma</h1>
<p>Cycas pluma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and its pinnately compound leaves that are narrow and feather-like. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones appearing on separate plants. Cycas pluma is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and requires well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
