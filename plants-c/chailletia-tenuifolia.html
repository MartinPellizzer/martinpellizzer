                    <h1>Chailletia tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Chailletia tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender-leaf chailletia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
