<p>Conanthus echiodes, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
