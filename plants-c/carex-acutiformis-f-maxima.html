                    <h1>Carex acutiformis f. maxima</h1>
<p>Carex acutiformis f. maxima, commonly known as the giant tussock sedge, is a variant of the slender flatsedge native to wetland and marsh environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage and dense, cylindrical inflorescences that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in riparian zones, bogs, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>This sedge is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting wetland biodiversity.</p>
