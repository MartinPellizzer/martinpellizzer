                    <h1>Conocarpus acuminatus</h1>
<p>Conocarpus acuminatus, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss and its ability to excrete excess salt through specialized glands. The plant has a shallow, fibrous root system that helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody, spherical fruits.</p>
<p>Conocarpus acuminatus plays a vital role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
