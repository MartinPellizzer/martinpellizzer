                    <h1>Centaurea montana var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Centaurea montana var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf mountain bluemink, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems and produces striking cobalt-blue to purple flower heads that resemble small mink-like tails. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky soils and open meadows, thriving in full sun and cool climates.</p>
