                    <h1>Calanthe woodii</h1>
<p>Calanthe woodii, commonly known as the Wood's calanthe, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountain forests of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific symbiotic fungi for nutrient uptake. Calanthe woodii has small, elliptical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in many regions.</p>
