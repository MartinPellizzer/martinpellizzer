                    <h1>Cerastium apricum</h1>
<p>Cerastium apricum, commonly known as the spring chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features small, white flowers with five petals and hairy, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its stems are prostrate, often rooting at the nodes, which helps it spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Cerastium apricum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens.</p>
