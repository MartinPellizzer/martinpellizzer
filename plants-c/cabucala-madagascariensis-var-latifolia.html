                    <h1>Cabucala madagascariensis var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Cabucala madagascariensis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed cabucala, is a rare endemic plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the dry season. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to retain moisture in the arid environments where it thrives.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
