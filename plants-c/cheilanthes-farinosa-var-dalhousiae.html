<p>Cheilanthes farinosa var. dalhousiae, commonly known as the Dalhousie's rockcap, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in mountainous and coastal areas where it forms dense, low-growing colonies.</p>
