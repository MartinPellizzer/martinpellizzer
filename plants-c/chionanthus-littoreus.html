                    <h1>Chionanthus littoreus</h1>
<p>Chionanthus littoreus, commonly known as coastal chionanthus, is a deciduous shrub native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its saline environment. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. Its root system is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding and salt spray, making it well-suited to coastal dunes and wetlands.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
