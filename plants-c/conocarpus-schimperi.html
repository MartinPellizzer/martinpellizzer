                    <h1>Conocarpus schimperi</h1>
<p>Conocarpus schimperi, commonly known as the African white mangrove, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rhizophoraceae family and is characterized by its salt-tolerant adaptations, allowing it to thrive in brackish water environments. The plant has pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its leaves are typically small and革质 (leathery), helping to reduce water loss in saline conditions.</p>
<p>Conocarpus schimperi plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
