<p>Calceolaria palustris subsp.</p>
<p>hitchcockii, commonly known as the marsh slipper orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color.</p>
<p>The plant prefers moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs or along the edges of marshes. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in shaded environments with consistent moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
