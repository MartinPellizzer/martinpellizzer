                    <h1>Cyclosorus austrophilippinus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus austrophilippinus, commonly known as the Philippine cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments with high humidity and moderate light conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
