                    <h1>Calicotome villosa</h1>
<p>Calicotome villosa, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in soft, silky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Calicotome villosa is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in savannas and rocky outcrops.</p>
