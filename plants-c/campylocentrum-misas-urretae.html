<p>Campylocentrum misas-urretae, commonly known as the Misas-Urreta's campylocentrum, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves and ability to collect rainwater in its leaf axils. The plant produces striking, colorful inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its foliage is often covered in fine, hair-like structures that aid in moisture retention and protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
