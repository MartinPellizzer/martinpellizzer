<p>Chelidonium majus var. tenuifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved greater celandine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a stout, branched stem that is often reddish in color and covered with a waxy coating. The plant produces bright yellow, oval-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive wavy margin.</p>
