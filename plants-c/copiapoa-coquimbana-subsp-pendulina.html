<p>Copiapoa coquimbana subsp.</p>
<p>pendulina, commonly known as the pendulous copiapoa, is a cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and clusters of white, tubular flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring.</p>
<p>The plant produces a dense, woolly covering of pale green to white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and protected plant.</p>
