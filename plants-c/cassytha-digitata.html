                    <h1>Cassytha digitata</h1>
<p>Cassytha digitata, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using haustoria, which absorb water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and has a vine-like structure that allows it to spread along the surface of its host. It is often found in wetland areas and can be an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it unique among parasitic plants, as it relies entirely on its host for survival.</p>
