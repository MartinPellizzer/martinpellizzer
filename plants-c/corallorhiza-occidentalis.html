<p>Corallorhiza occidentalis, commonly known as the western pinkroot, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph that relies on fungal networks for nutrients. The plant produces showy, pink or reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
