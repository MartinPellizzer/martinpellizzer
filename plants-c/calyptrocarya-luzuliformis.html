<p>Calyptrocarya luzuliformis, commonly known as the silverleaf cycad, is a unique plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves that are covered in a waxy, silver coating. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a thick, fibrous layer. Its reproductive structures include large, cone-like strobili, which are typical of cycads.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
