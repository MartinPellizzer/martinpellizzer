<p>Crotalaria heptaphylla, commonly known as the seven-leaf cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are trifoliate with seven leaflets, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, followed by pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It is a legume, meaning it has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Crotalaria heptaphylla is often grown as a forage crop and has traditional uses in some African cultures.</p>
