                            <h1>Clidemia Epiphytica</h1>
<p>False hoya, scientifically known as Clidemia epiphytica, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is commonly found growing on trees and rocks in humid, shaded environments. Despite its name, it is not a true hoya but belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. It plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds.</p>
