                    <h1>Celtis jessoensis f. angustibolia</h1>
<p>Celtis jessoensis f. angustibolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boxelder, is a rare variant of the boxelder tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form. The plant exhibits a deciduous habit, shedding its leaves in the fall, and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring. Its fruit is a small, round samara that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>This form is often found in moist, shaded habitats within temperate forests.</p>
