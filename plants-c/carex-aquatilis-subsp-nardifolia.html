<p>Carex aquatilis subsp.</p>
<p>nardifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are narrow and dark green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
