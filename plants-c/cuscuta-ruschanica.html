                    <h1>Cuscuta ruschanica</h1>
<p>Cuscuta ruschanica, commonly known as the Russian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and is often found growing on crops such as wheat and barley. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread widely.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
