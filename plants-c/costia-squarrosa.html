<p>Costia squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrose costia, is a unicellular alga belonging to the genus Costia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, spindle-shaped body with a distinctive squarrosa (broad, rounded) apex. This organism is typically found in freshwater environments, where it thrives in nutrient-rich conditions. Costia squarrosa reproduces through the formation of flagellated zoospores, which are released into the water.</p>
<p>Its presence is often indicative of eutrophic conditions in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
