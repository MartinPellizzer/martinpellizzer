<p>Cannomois cephalotes, commonly known as the helmet fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, helmet-shaped spore cases that are prominently visible on its fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are leathery and can reach lengths of up to one meter, with a complex arrangement of pinnae.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in groups called sori.</p>
