<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, brush-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a slender, branched stem and produces small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption, and it relies on host plants for water and nutrients.</p>
