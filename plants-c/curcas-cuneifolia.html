<p>Curcas cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chenopod, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in width. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by dry, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Curcas cuneifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
