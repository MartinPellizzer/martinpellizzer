<p>Combretum nigricans var. nigricans, commonly known as blackwood or African ebony, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hard, heavy wood, it has been historically valued for carving and tool-making.</p>
