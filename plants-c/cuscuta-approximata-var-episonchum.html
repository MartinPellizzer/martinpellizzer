                    <h1>Cuscuta approximata var. episonchum</h1>
<p>Cuscuta approximata var. episonchum, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants to establish connections for nutrient transfer. The plant is native to North America and is often found on various herbaceous and woody hosts. Its life cycle involves seed germination, attachment to a host, and the development of a specialized vascular system for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural and ornamental plants.</p>
