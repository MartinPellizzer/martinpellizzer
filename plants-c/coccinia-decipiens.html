<p>Coccinia decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive cucumber, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other gourds and cucurbits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by green, pear-shaped fruits. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered with fine hairs.</p>
<p>The fruit is often mistaken for a real cucumber due to its appearance, hence the common name.</p>
