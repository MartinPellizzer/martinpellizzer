                    <h1>Cuscuta asiatica</h1>
<p>Cuscuta asiatica, commonly known as the Asian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth rate, often covering its host with a dense network of stems. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution. It is commonly found on crops like soybeans and cotton, causing significant agricultural losses.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves germination, attachment to a host, and the development of a complex network of haustoria to extract nutrients.</p>
