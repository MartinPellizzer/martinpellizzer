<p>Chianthemum plicatum, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas.</p>

The plant produces small, showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
