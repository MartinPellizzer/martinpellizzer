                    <h1>Cheilanthes heterophylla</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes heterophylla, commonly known as the variable fern or the rock brake, is a perennial evergreen fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments due to its drought-resistant adaptations. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes heterophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
