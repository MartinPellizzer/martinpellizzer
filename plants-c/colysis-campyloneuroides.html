<p>Colysis campyloneuroides, commonly known as the spiral-leaf shrub, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant has woody stems that become more branched with age, and its leaves are typically narrow and leathery. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and adaptability, it is often used in xerophytic gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
