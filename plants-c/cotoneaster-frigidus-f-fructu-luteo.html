                    <h1>Cotoneaster frigidus f. fructu-luteo</h1>
<p>Cotoneaster frigidus f. fructu-luteo, commonly known as the golden-fruited cotoneaster, is a frost-tolerant shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, ovate leaves that remain foliage throughout the winter. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by its distinguishing feature: bright yellow berries that persist into the winter months. These berries are edible for birds but are generally not consumed by humans.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cold climates.</p>
