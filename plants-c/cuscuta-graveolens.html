                    <h1>Cuscuta graveolens</h1>
<p>Cuscuta graveolens, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow-orange flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on crops such as soybeans and sunflowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and mechanical means, allowing it to spread quickly.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
