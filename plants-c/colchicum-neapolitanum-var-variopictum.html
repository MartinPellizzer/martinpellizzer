                    <h1>Colchicum neapolitanum var. variopictum</h1>
<p>Colchicum neapolitanum var. variopictum, commonly known as the Naples colchicum, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features showy, spurred flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette, and its bulbs are adapted for storage of nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
