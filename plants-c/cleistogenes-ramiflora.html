<p>Cleistogenes ramiflora, commonly known as the ramiflorous grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Cleistogenes ramiflora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
