                    <h1>Cypripedium × ventricosum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × ventricosum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium pubescens, combining traits from both parent plants. The plant is characterized by its large, showy, pouch-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with dark markings. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and bogs, typically in temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in many areas.</p>
