                    <h1>Carinta uniflora</h1>
<p>Carinta uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower carinta, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, solitary flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale purple, often in late spring or early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal moths, which are attracted to its strong, sweet fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Carinta uniflora is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
