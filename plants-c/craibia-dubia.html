                    <h1>Craibia dubia</h1>
<p>Craibia dubia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise ghostly appearance. Craibia dubia is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves to survive periods of drought.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is a sought-after plant among collectors and botanists alike.</p>
