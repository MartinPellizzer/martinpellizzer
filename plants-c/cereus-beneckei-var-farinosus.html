                    <h1>Cereus beneckei var. farinosus</h1>
<p>Cereus beneckei var. farinosus, commonly known as the Farino's Cereus, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that open at night, a feature typical of many night-blooming cacti. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The varietal name 'farinosus' refers to the fine, powdery coating on its stems, which gives it a unique appearance.</p>
