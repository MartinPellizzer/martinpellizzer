<p>Castilleja hyparctica, commonly known as the eastern prairie bluet, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on root connections to host plants for nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of grassland ecosystems.</p>
