                    <h1>Carex aleutica</h1>
<p>Carex aleutica, commonly known as the Aleutian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters, typical of the Carex genus. This plant thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and bogs. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Carex aleutica plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems.</p>
