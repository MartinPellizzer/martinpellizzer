                    <h1>Cardamine tenella var. dissecta</h1>
<p>Cardamine tenella var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected watercress, is a perennial herb native to moist, shaded environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble those of watercress, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in wet soils along stream banks and forest floors.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its edible leaves, which have a mild, peppery flavor similar to watercress.</p>
