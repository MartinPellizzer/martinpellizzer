<p>Chrysopsis hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The hairy texture of its stems and leaves helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
