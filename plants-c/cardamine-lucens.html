<p>Cardamine lucens, commonly known as the slender watercress, is a small herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a glossy, dark green appearance and small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Cardamine lucens is often found in calcareous soils and is considered a characteristic species of mesic to wet forest ecosystems.</p>
