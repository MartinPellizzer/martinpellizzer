The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands, often in association with other orchid species. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and a complex rhizome system.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
