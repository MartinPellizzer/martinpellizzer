                    <h1>Cardamine bulbifera var. pilosa</h1>
<p>Cardamine bulbifera var. pilosa, commonly known as hairy watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a single terminal umbel, which bloom in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, while its bulbs serve as storage organs for nutrients.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its hairy foliage, which helps distinguish it from other Cardamine species.</p>
