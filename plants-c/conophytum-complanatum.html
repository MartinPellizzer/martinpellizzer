                    <h1>Conophytum complanatum</h1>
<p>Conophytum complanatum, commonly known as the flat-topped stone plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rosette-shaped body with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically flat and bluish-green, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Conophytum complanatum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
