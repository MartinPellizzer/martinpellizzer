                    <h1>Cuscuta obtusiflora var. vera</h1>
<p>Cuscuta obtusiflora var. vera, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed germination, attachment to a host, and eventual flowering. The plant's stems are thread-like and can spread across the host's surface, forming a dense network. It is often found in agricultural fields and gardens, where it can become a problematic weed.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on parasitism and plant interactions.</p>
