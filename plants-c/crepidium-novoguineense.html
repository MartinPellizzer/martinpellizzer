                    <h1>Crepidium novoguineense</h1>
<p>Crepidium novoguineense, commonly known as the New Guinea bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid lowland forests of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche in its native habitat.</p>
