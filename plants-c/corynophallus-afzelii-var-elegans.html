                    <h1>Corynophallus afzelii var. elegans</h1>
<p>Corynophallus afzelii var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant stinkhorn, is a fungal plant that belongs to the Phallaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, phallic-shaped fruiting body that emerges from a basal, bulbous structure. The fungus is notable for its strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts flies and other insects for spore dispersal. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and gardens.</p>
<p>The species is often found decomposing organic matter, contributing to nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.</p>
