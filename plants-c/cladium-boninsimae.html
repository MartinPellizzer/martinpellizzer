<p>Cladium boninsimae, commonly known as the Bonin marsh reed, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Bonin Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and broad, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clumps. The plant thrives in brackish or freshwater wetlands, often forming extensive mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic species. Its flowering spikes, which appear at the end of the growing season, produce small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cladium boninsimae is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical conservation efforts.</p>
