                    <h1>Cuscuta flossdorfii var. tucumanensis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta flossdorfii var. tucumanensis, commonly known as the Tucuman dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host plants. The plant is native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Chile. It typically infests grasses and other herbaceous plants, forming dense mats that can weaken or kill the host.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in both ecological interactions and agricultural challenges.</p>
