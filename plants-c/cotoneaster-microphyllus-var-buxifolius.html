                    <h1>Cotoneaster microphyllus var. buxifolius</h1>
<p>Cotoneaster microphyllus var. buxifolius, commonly known as the boxleaf cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to western China.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are leathery and closely resemble those of boxwood, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes.</p>
<p>Cotoneaster microphyllus var. buxifolius is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
