                    <h1>Cynometra marginata var. guianensis</h1>
<p>Cynometra marginata var. guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark brown to black bark, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its hard wood, it is widely used in construction and furniture-making, though it is also threatened by deforestation.</p>
