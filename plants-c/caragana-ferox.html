                    <h1>Caragana ferox</h1>
<p>Caragana ferox, commonly known as the Siberian peashrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold climates of Central Asia and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, compound leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces pea-like flowers in clusters, which are typically pink or pale red, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. Caragana ferox is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils and tolerating extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
