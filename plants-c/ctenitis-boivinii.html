                    <h1>Ctenitis boivinii</h1>
<p>Ctenitis boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's sea holly, is a rare and striking member of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiky, blue to purple flower heads that resemble sea urchins, surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. Native to the Mediterranean region, this plant thrives in coastal and rocky environments. It is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ctenitis boivinii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
