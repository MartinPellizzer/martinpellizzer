                    <h1>Coelocaryon botryoides</h1>
<p>Coelocaryon botryoides, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy environments where it can thrive on the nutrients obtained from captured insects. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>The plant's unique adaptations allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
