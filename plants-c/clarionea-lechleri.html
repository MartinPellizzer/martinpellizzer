                    <h1>Clarionea lechleri</h1>
<p>Clarionea lechleri, commonly known as the rubber tree, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is renowned for its latex-producing properties, which have been historically harvested for natural rubber. The plant features a thick, woody trunk and large, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>The latex is extracted by making incisions in the bark, a process that has been practiced for centuries by indigenous communities.</p>
