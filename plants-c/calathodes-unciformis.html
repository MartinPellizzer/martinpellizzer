                    <h1>Calathodes unciformis</h1>
<p>Calathodes unciformis, commonly known as the slender leaf fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that give it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calathodes unciformis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
