                    <h1>Cenchrus unisetus</h1>
<p>Cenchrus unisetus, commonly known as the slender sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with narrow, rigid leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to brownish spikelets, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant in marginal environments.</p>
