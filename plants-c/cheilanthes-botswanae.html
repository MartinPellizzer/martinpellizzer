<p>Cheilanthes botswanae, commonly known as the Botswana rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant features lance-shaped, dark green fronds with a leathery texture, adapted to withstand drought conditions. It typically grows on rocky outcrops and sandy soils, thriving in full sun.</p>
<p>Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating reproduction in its harsh environment.</p>
