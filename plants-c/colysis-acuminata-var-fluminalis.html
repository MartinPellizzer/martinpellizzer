                    <h1>Colysis acuminata var. fluminalis</h1>
<p>Colysis acuminata var. fluminalis, commonly known as the river colysis, is a perennial aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters such as rivers and wetlands, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged, with some floating foliage that aids in photosynthesis. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing in the early spring, and it produces distinctive, elongated fruits that disperse seeds via water.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by reducing erosion and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
