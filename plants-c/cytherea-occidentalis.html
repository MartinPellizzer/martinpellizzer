                    <h1>Cytherea occidentalis</h1>
<p>Cytherea occidentalis, commonly known as the western starflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of white and purple. The plant has lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Cytherea occidentalis is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>
