                    <h1>Chymocarpus tricolor</h1>
<p>Chymocarpus tricolor, commonly known as the pink-flowered sweet grass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its distinctive pink or purple flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, three-lobed seeds enclosed in a fibrous husk, which is a feature of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its colorful inflorescences and its ability to attract pollinators.</p>
