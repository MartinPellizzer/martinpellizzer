                    <h1>Chamaechaenactis scaposa</h1>
<p>Chamaechaenactis scaposa, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces a single, showy yellow flower that blooms in the spring, followed by a crown of white pappus-like bracts that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
