                    <h1>Camellia furfuracea var. shanglinensis</h1>
<p>Camellia furfuracea var. shanglinensis, commonly known as the Shanglin camellia, is a rare and ornamental plant native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves and striking, red-orange flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is closely related to the camellia species used in tea production but is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic value. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
