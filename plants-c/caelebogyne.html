                    <h1>Caelebogyne</h1>
<p>Caelebogyne, commonly known as the sacred lotus of ancient Egypt, is a striking aquatic plant with large, showy flowers.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nymphaeaceae and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant's flowers, which can be pink, white, or blue, open in the early morning and close at night. Caelebogyne thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in marshes and ponds.</p>
<p>Its symbolic significance in Egyptian culture is reflected in its botanical features and growth patterns.</p>
