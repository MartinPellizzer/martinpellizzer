                    <h1>Cyclosorus subcaudipinnus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus subcaudipinnus, commonly known as the narrow-tailed water clover, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and marshes. The plant has finely divided, pinnately arranged leaves that form a dense, floating mat on the water surface. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
