                    <h1>Coronopus fungosus</h1>
<p>Coronopus fungosus, commonly known as the fungal crownplant, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like inflorescence.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil. The plant's leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other umbellifers, while its flowers are small and white, arranged in a compact cluster. Coronopus fungosus is notable for its association with specific fungal mycorrhizal relationships that aid in nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
