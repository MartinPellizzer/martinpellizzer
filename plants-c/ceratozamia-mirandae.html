                    <h1>Ceratozamia mirandae</h1>
<p>Ceratozamia mirandae, commonly known as the Miranda cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being elongated and the female cones more compact, typical of cycads. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Ceratozamia mirandae is classified as endangered.</p>
<p>Its botanical study provides valuable insights into the evolution and conservation of cycads.</p>
