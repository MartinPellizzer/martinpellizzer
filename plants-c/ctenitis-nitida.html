                    <h1>Ctenitis nitida</h1>
<p>Ctenitis nitida, commonly known as the slender sea holly, is a rare and unique plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to thrive in sandy, coastal soils. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing dune environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ctenitis nitida is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
