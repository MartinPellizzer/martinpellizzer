                    <h1>Cuscuta subtilis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta subtilis, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host to form connections for nutrient transfer. The plant is widely distributed across temperate regions and can infest a variety of crops and ornamental plants. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, animals, or through contaminated agricultural equipment.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural yields if left unchecked.</p>
