The plant has small, opposite, ovate leaves and produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing resources for wildlife.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature and ornamental value make it both ecologically and botanically significant.</p>
