<p>Carex macrostylos var. guthnickiana, commonly known as Guthnick's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its larger, more prominent floral bracts compared to the typical form of Carex macrostylos.</p>
