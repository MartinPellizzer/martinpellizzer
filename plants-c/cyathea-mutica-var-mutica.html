<p>Cyathea mutica var. mutica, commonly known as the common tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer of dead fronds. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, with the uppermost fronds bearing sporangia for reproduction. Its rhizome is thick and underground, supporting the growth of the trunk and roots.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
