                    <h1>Caroxylon armatum</h1>
<p>Caroxylon armatum, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a robust, fleshy root system adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. Its most distinctive feature is its tall, spire-like inflorescence, which bears showy, white or pale pink flowers.</p>
<p>Caroxylon armatum plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
