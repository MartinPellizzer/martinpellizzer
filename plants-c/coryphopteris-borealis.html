                    <h1>Coryphopteris borealis</h1>
<p>Coryphopteris borealis, commonly known as the northern holly fern, is a fern native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that remain throughout the year. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
