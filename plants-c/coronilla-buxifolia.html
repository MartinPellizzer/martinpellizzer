                    <h1>Coronilla buxifolia</h1>
<p>Coronilla buxifolia, commonly known as the box-leaved crownvetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and trifoliate leaves that resemble those of boxwood, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by pods containing several seeds. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and stabilize soils.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value also makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions.</p>
