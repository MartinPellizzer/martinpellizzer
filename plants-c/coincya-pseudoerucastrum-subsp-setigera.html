<p>Coincya pseudoerucastrum subsp.</p>
<p>setigera, commonly known as the slender water starwort, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, star-shaped leaves. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually floating or submersed, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, contributing to its role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its morphological adaptations to its aquatic habitat.</p>
