                    <h1>Cyclosorus afrus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus afrus, commonly known as the African cyclosorus, is a small, aquatic fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as streams and ponds. The plant has finely divided, thread-like fronds that are often submerged, contributing to its delicate appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus afrus plays a minor but important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality maintenance.</p>
