                    <h1>Cuscuta kotschyi</h1>
<p>Cuscuta kotschyi, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that begins with seed germination, followed by the attachment to a host via specialized root-like structures called haustoria. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions, including parts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through the movement of soil.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and native vegetation.</p>
