<p>Carex scabrata, commonly known as rough sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are often rough to the touch. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of flowers, typically in shades of green or brown, which develop into three-angled berries. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Carex scabrata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse ecosystems.</p>
