                    <h1>Cuscuta pentagona var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Cuscuta pentagona var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like stem that缠绕 (wraps around) its hosts. The plant is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) stems and is native to various regions in North America. It typically infests crops and wild plants, causing reduced growth and yield in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in both ecological interactions and weed management strategies.</p>
