<p>Cupressus funebris subsp.</p>
<p>tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin cypress, is a rare and ornamental evergreen conifer native to Vietnam. It features a narrow, columnar growth habit with dense, scale-like leaves that are a deep blue-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by round, woody cones. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for small garden spaces or as a landscape accent.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
