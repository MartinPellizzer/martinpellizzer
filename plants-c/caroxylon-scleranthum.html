<p>Caroxylon scleranthum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, often blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Caroxylon scleranthum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
