                    <h1>Cuscuta racemosa var. regnelliana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta racemosa var. regnelliana, commonly known as yellow dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, and its seeds are typically dispersed by wind or animals. The plant's stems are slender and twining, allowing it to attach to various hosts such as grasses and shrubs. It is native to North America and can be found in a variety of habitats, including disturbed soils and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, with germination often occurring in response to chemical signals released by the host plant.</p>
