                    <h1>Carex insaniae f. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Carex insaniae f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bog sedge, is a variant of the species Carex insaniae, characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant native to wetland habitats, particularly in northern regions of North America. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly curled, adapting to the moist, often acidic conditions of its environment.</p>
<p>This form is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
