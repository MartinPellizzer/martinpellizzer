                    <h1>Cassytha multiflora</h1>
<p>Cassytha multiflora, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true roots, leaves, and stems.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to host plants using specialized structures called haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is considered an invasive species in many areas due to its ability to spread rapidly.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and parasitic nature make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
