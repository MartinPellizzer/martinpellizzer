                    <h1>Castanea nana</h1>
<p>Castanea nana, commonly known as the dwarf chestnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 1â€“3 meters, featuring a compact, bushy form with smooth, gray-brown bark. The plant produces small, spiny capsules that contain one or two edible chestnuts, which are similar in taste to those of the common chestnut. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the autumn.</p>
<p>Castanea nana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types.</p>
