                    <h1>Comanthera linderi</h1>
<p>Comanthera linderi, commonly known as the Linder's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale green, translucent leaves and a single, delicate white or pale pink flower. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic, and relies on specific environmental conditions for survival. Its habitat is highly specialized, often found in shaded, humid environments with particular soil and moisture requirements.</p>
<p>Due to its fragility and limited distribution, Comanthera linderi is considered a conservation concern.</p>
