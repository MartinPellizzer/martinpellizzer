<p>Colchicum nivale, commonly known as the snow colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>

The plant has fleshy, basal leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is part of the Colchicaceae family, known for its association with the toxic alkaloid colchicine.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
