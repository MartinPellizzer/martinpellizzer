                    <h1>Chamaesyce tonsita</h1>
<p>Chamaesyce tonsita, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It typically features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are often inconspicuous and appear in the axils of the leaves. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Chamaesyce tonsita is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in desert landscapes.</p>
