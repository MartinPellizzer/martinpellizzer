<p>Ctenopteris rhizophorae, commonly known as the mangrove fern, is a species of fern that thrives in coastal and brackish water environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into narrow, feather-like segments. This plant is often found growing in association with mangrove trees, contributing to the ecological stability of these wetland habitats. Its rhizomes form dense networks that help bind soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to tolerate saltwater makes it an important component of tidal ecosystems.</p>
