<p>Coelopleurum lucidum var. gmelinii, commonly known as the Gmelin's golden bell, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, which are often clustered in bell-shaped clusters. The plant has a woody stem with smooth, grayish bark, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and lanceolate in shape. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, temperate climate to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
