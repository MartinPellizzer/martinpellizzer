<p>Chironia linoides subsp.</p>
<p>nana, commonly known as the dwarf chironia, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of no more than 10 centimeters, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting.</p>
<p>Due to its modest size and ornamental value, it is a favored choice for gardeners looking to add texture and color to smaller spaces.</p>
