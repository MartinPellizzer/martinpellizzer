<p>Clerodendrum pittieri, commonly known as the red lantern plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pendulous red bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by orange to red fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy texture, contributing to its visual appeal.</p>
