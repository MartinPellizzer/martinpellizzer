                    <h1>Calpurnia woodii</h1>
<p>Calpurnia woodii, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is notable for its unique growth habit, as it often grows in dense clusters on limestone soils. Due to habitat loss and limited seed dispersal, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and its status as a symbol of biodiversity in threatened ecosystems.</p>
