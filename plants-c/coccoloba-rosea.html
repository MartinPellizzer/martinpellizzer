<p>Coccoloba rosea, commonly known as the red mangrove or red bay, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive red, fleshy leaves that help it thrive in saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. Coccoloba rosea is often found in mangrove ecosystems, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to brackish water makes it an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
