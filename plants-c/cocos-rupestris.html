                    <h1>Cocos rupestris</h1>
<p>Cocos rupestris, commonly known as the rock coconut or stone coconut, is a unique species of palm native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by round, fibrous fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its adaptation to rocky and arid environments, it exhibits specialized root systems and water-conserving mechanisms.</p>
<p>However, it is considered rare and is often found in protected natural habitats.</p>
