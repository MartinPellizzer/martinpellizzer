<p>Calystegia sepium subsp.</p>
<p>silvatica, commonly known as the forest bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems, often found in woodlands and along forest edges.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its roots are fibrous and can spread extensively.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its vigorous growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
