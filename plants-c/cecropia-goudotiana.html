<p>Cecropia goudotiana, commonly known as the Goudot's ceiba, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and broad, palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers that are often clustered in panicles, attracting various pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds.</p>
<p>Cecropia goudotiana is also notable for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing its growth in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
