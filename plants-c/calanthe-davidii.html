                    <h1>Calanthe davidii</h1>
<p>Calanthe davidii, commonly known as the David's calanthe, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rhizomatous growth habit with broad, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically arranged in a raceme along the stem. It thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native regions.</p>
