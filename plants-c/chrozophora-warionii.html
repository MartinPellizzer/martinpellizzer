                    <h1>Chrozophora warionii</h1>
<p>Chrozophora warionii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, globe-shaped seed heads that resemble dandelion fluff. Its fibrous root system allows it to survive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought.</p>
<p>Chrozophora warionii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
