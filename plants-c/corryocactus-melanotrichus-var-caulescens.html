                    <h1>Corryocactus melanotrichus var. caulescens</h1>
<p>Corryocactus melanotrichus var. caulescens, commonly known as the red-tipped columnar cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height, adorned with dense, spiny ribs. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to store water in its native dry environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
