                <h1>Claytonia virginica</h1>
<p>Claytonia virginica, commonly known as pink pimpernel, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, showy pink or white flowers in the spring, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Claytonia virginica is also known for its ability to bloom early in the growing season, often before many other spring-flowering plants.</p>
