                    <h1>Cotoneaster hebephyllus</h1>
<p>Cotoneaster hebephyllus, commonly known as the dwarf cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It features small, oval leaves that turn red in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. It is relatively low-maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and seasonal color changes, it is often used in landscaping for hedging or as a specimen plant.</p>
