                    <h1>Cuscuta epitribulum</h1>
<p>Cuscuta epitribulum, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has a vine-like structure with tiny, thread-like branches that attach to host plants. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize a wide range of host species. It is often found on shrubs and trees in various habitats, including forests and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host, making it a significant concern in agricultural and natural ecosystems.</p>
