                    <h1>Cyperus chrysanthoides</h1>
<p>Cyperus chrysanthoides, commonly known as the golden flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or golden in color, giving it its common name. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a useful wetland indicator species and a potential invasive plant in certain areas.</p>
