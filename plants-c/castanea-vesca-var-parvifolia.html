                    <h1>Castanea vesca var. parvifolia</h1>
<p>Castanea vesca var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are smaller and more delicate compared to those of the common horse chestnut. The tree produces spiny husks that enclose bright orange-red seeds, which are edible when fully mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The flowers are white and clustered in panicles, adding to its aesthetic appeal in spring.</p>
