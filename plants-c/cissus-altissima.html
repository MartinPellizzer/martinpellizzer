                    <h1>Cissus altissima</h1>
<p>Cissus altissima, commonly known as the climbing devil's ivy, is a vigorous climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and small, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Cissus altissima is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to climb structures.</p>
