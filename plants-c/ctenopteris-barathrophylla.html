<p>Ctenopteris barathrophylla, commonly known as the hairy sea palm, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, tree-like structure with a thick, woody trunk and fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The fronds are pinnately compound, with numerous leaflets that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy structures. This plant thrives in coastal environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in tidal zones.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptability to saline conditions make it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
