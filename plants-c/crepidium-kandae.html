<p>Crepidium kandae, commonly known as the Kandae orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, intricate flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
