<p>Cyclostemon glaber, commonly known as the smooth cyclostemon, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>

The plant has a woody stem with smooth, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are simple, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Cyclostemon glaber is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
