                    <h1>Cuscuta epithymum</h1>
<p>Cuscuta epithymum, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its host to extract water and nutrients. The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it often infests crops and wild plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
