                    <h1>Carex × kattaeana</h1>
<p>Carex × kattaeana, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Carex acutata and Carex lyngbyei, characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows, and prefers partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with male and female flowers typically separated on different spikelets.</p>
