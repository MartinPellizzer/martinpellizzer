                    <h1>Cirsium × digeneum</h1>
<p>Cirsium × digeneum, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Cirsium vulgare and Cirsium arvense, resulting in a plant with a combination of traits from both parents. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has a robust root system and can spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Its floral structure includes both ray and disk flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
