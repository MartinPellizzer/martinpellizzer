<p>Ctenitis protensa var. funesta, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are typically dark green to black in color, giving it its common name. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
