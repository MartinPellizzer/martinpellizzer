                            <h1>Catha Rupestris</h1>
<p>Catha rupestris is a unique and lesser-known plant native to the arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the same family as the well-known khat plant, which is widely used in various cultures. Despite its similarities, Catha rupestris is often overlooked due to its smaller size and less aggressive growth habits. This plant is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its stimulating effects. Its resilience in harsh environments makes it an interesting subject for botanical and ethnobotanical studies.</p>
