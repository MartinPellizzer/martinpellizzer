                    <h1>Cordia scandens</h1>
<p>Cordia scandens, commonly known as the climbing cordia, is a tropical shrub or vine native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange or red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
