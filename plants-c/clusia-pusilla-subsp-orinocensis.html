<p>Clusia pusilla subsp.</p>
<p>orinocensis, commonly known as the Orinoco Clusia, is a small evergreen shrub native to South America, particularly Venezuela and Colombia. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae, also known as the guttiferae, and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its tropical habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds and mammals.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to various soil types and drought tolerance make it a resilient plant in its native range.</p>
