<p>Calamagrostis cordechii var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth false panicgrass, is a grass species native to certain regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in wetland restoration projects.</p>
