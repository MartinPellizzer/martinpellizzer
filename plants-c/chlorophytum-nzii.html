                    <h1>Chlorophytum nzii</h1>
<p>Chlorophytum nzii, commonly known as the New Zealand spider plant, is a member of the Asparagaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its long, arching leaves that resemble spider legs, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It is a hardy, evergreen perennial that thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun.</p>
<p>Chlorophytum nzii is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and air-purifying qualities.</p>
