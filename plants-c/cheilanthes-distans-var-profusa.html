                    <h1>Cheilanthes distans var. profusa</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes distans var. profusa, commonly known as the broad-leaf rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, upright rhizomes and its distinctive, lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, pale hairs. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of its leaves, which are typically found in the axils of the leaflets.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
