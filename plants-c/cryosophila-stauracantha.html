<p>Cryosophila stauracantha, commonly known as the snow cushion, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to extreme cold environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. It produces bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
