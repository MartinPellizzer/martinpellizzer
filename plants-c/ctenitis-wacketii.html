<p>Ctenitis wacketii, commonly known as the Wackett's sea holly, is a rare and unique species of flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features robust, succulent leaves with a waxy coating, adapted to withstand the harsh coastal environment. Its flowers are typically blue or purple, arranged in dense, spherical clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ctenitis wacketii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
