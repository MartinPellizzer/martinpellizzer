                    <h1>Cecropia eximia</h1>
<p>Cecropia eximia, commonly known as the giant cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and striking, showy inflorescences. The plant has a unique relationship with certain ants, which inhabit the hollow stems and provide protection against herbivores. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats make it an important species in ecological succession.</p>
<p>The tree also plays a role in supporting local biodiversity and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
