The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
