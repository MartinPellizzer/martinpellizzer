                    <h1>Carelia</h1>
<p>Carelia, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a halophytic shrub that thrives in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fleshy, red berries. Its roots form a dense network that stabilizes shorelines and prevents erosion.</p>
<p>Carelia is an important species in mangrove ecosystems, providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
