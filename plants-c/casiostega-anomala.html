                    <h1>Casiostega anomala</h1>
<p>Casiostega anomala, commonly known as the strange-case mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of other host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is native to parts of Africa and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
