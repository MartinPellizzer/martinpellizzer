                    <h1>Coffea arabica var. bullata</h1>
<p>Coffea arabica var. bullata, commonly known as the bullate coffee plant, is a variant of the arabica coffee species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, warty protrusions on the fruit's surface, which give it its common name. This unique morphological feature is a result of genetic mutations and is more pronounced in certain cultivars. The plant is native to Ethiopia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its potential for producing coffee beans.</p>
<p>While it is less common in commercial coffee production, it remains an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
