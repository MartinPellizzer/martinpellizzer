<p>Cheilanthes multifida subsp.</p>
<p>lacerata, commonly known as the fringed rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving it a fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky environments.</p>
