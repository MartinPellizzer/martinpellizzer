                    <h1>Cola sciaphila</h1>
<p>Cola sciaphila, commonly known as the shadow cola, is a rare and elusive plant species native to the dense rainforests of Central and West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by its characteristic caffeine-containing berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cola sciaphila is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed tropical ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and scientifically intriguing.</p>
