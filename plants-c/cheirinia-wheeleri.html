<p>Cheirinia wheeleri, commonly known as the Wheeler's cheirinia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often emitting a subtle scent when crushed.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cheirinia wheeleri is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
