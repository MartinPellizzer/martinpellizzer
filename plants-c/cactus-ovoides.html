<p>Cactus ovoides, commonly known as the Easter cactus, is a succulent plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features short, thick stems that often branch out, forming a compact, rounded shape. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are usually modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>The Easter cactus is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal watering to thrive.</p>
