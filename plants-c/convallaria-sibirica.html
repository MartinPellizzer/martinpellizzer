<p>Convallaria sibirica, commonly known as Siberian lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous root system, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It thrives in well-drained, loamy soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for both aesthetic and traditional uses.</p>
