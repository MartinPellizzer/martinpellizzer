                    <h1>Cybianthus apiculatus</h1>
<p>Cybianthus apiculatus, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically features dense clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Cybianthus apiculatus thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to survive in harsh, high-altitude conditions.</p>
