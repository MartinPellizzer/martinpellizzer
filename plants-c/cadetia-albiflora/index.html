                            <h1>Cadetia Albiflora</h1>
<p>Alpine whiteflower, scientifically known as Cadetia albiflora, is a rare and delicate plant that thrives in the high-altitude regions of the European Alps. This small flowering species is characterized by its pale white blooms and compact, low-growing habit, making it a striking yet subtle addition to alpine meadows. Found primarily in rocky and gravelly soils, it has adapted to harsh environmental conditions such as cold temperatures and strong winds. Its limited distribution and fragile nature make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike. Despite its modest appearance, the Alpine whiteflower plays an important ecological role in its specialized habitat.</p>
