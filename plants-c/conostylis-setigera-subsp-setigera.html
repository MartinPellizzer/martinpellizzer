<p>Conostylis setigera subsp.</p>
<p>setigera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved conostylis, is a perennial herb native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands, often in sandy or loamy soils.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers in dense spikes during spring. It is adapted to dry conditions and has a deep root system to access water.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in supporting local pollinators and its resilience to environmental stressors.</p>
