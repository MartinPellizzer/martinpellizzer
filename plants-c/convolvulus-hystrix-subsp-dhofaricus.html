<p>Convolvulus hystrix subsp.</p>
<p>dhofaricus, commonly known as the Dhofar convolvulus, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy, slender stems that help it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a rough texture that provides some protection against desert conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for xerophytic gardens.</p>
