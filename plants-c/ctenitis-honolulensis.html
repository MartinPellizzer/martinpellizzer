                    <h1>Ctenitis honolulensis</h1>
<p>Ctenitis honolulensis, commonly known as the Honululu fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
