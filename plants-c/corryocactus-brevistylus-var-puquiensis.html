<p>Corryocactus brevistylus var. puquiensis, commonly known as the Puquian cactus, is a rare and distinctive species native to the Andean regions of Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the dry season, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
