                    <h1>Calanthe alba</h1>
<p>Calanthe alba, commonly known as the white calanthe, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elegant, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb.</p>
<p>Calanthe alba prefers cool, humid environments and is often found in forest understories where it receives filtered sunlight.</p>
