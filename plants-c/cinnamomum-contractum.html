                    <h1>Cinnamomum contractum</h1>
<p>Cinnamomum contractum, commonly known as Malabar cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark purple berries. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial shade. Its bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to cinnamon.</p>
<p>However, it is less commercially significant than Cinnamomum verum.</p>
