                    <h1>Cocos leiospatha</h1>
<p>Cocos leiospatha, commonly known as the smooth-leaf coconut, is a rare and lesser-known species within the palm family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, smooth, and leathery leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces large, spadix-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many palms. Its fruit is a fibrous, coconut-like structure that contains a single seed.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
