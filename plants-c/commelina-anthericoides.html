<p>It belongs to the Commelinaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in wet soil, while its stems are often creeping or rhizomatous.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse seeds by wind.</p>
