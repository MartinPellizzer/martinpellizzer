<p>Cardamine foliacea, commonly known as water shield, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in wetlands, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has distinctive kidney-shaped leaves that are floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its small white flowers appear in clusters and bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Cardamine foliacea plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small aquatic organisms.</p>
