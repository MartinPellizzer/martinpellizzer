<p>Corion marinum var. leiospermum, commonly known as the smooth-seeded sea corion, is a coastal plant adapted to saline and sandy environments.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in smooth, leathery pods that disperse with the wind.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in dune ecosystems along the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts.</p>
