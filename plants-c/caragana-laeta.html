                    <h1>Caragana laeta</h1>
<p>Caragana laeta, commonly known as the yellow shrub peas, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, including parts of China, Mongolia, and Russia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Caragana laeta is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
