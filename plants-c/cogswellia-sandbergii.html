<p>Cogswellia sandbergii, commonly known as the sandberg's cogswellia, is a rare and unique succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple hues. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
