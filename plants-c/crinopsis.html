<p>Crinopsis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the dandelion family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to salty, sandy soils. They have distinctive blue or violet flowers that resemble holly berries, hence their common name. Crinopsis species often have a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to thrive in harsh maritime environments makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
