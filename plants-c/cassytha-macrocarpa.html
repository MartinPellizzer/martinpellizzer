                    <h1>Cassytha macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Cassytha macrocarpa, commonly known as the Christmas vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a climbing vine characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. Its rapid growth and ability to twine around other plants make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive.</p>
<p>Cassytha macrocarpa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
