                    <h1>Calyptrogenia bracteosa</h1>
<p>Calyptrogenia bracteosa, commonly known as the bracted calyptrogen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features distinctive bracts that enclose its flowering structures, giving it its scientific name. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Calyptrogenia bracteosa is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
