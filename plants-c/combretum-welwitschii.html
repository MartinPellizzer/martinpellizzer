<p>Combretum welwitschii, commonly known as the welwitschia, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant has a distinctive appearance with two large, strap-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. It also produces small, inconspicuous flowers and fruiting bodies that are adapted to the harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive extreme drought makes it a remarkable example of botanical adaptation.</p>
