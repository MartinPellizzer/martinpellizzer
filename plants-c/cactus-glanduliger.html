                    <h1>Cactus glanduliger</h1>
<p>Cactus glanduliger, commonly known as the glandular cactus, is a species native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has specialized structures called areoles, which are sites for the growth of spines, flowers, and branches. Its adaptations include thick, fleshy stems that store water and a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The glandular hairs on its surface help to deter herbivores and reduce evaporation.</p>
