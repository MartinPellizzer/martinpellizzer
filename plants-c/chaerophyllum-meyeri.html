                <h1>Chaerophyllum meyeri</h1>
<p>Chaerophyllum meyeri, commonly known as Meyer's hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, compound leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are often hairy and have a strong, aromatic odor.</p>
<p>Due to its resemblance to other toxic plants, it can be mistaken for harmful species, requiring caution when handling.</p>
