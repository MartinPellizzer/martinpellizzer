                    <h1>Carex digitata var. alpina</h1>
<p>Carex digitata var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and provides habitat for various small organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in arid and alpine landscapes.</p>
