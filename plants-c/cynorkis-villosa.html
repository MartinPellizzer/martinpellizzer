<p>Cynorkis villosa, commonly known as the hairy cycad, is a species of cycad native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being larger and more prominent than the male ones. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
