                    <h1>Cuscuta gronovii var. calyptrata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta gronovii var. calyptrata, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host to establish a connection. The plant is native to parts of North America and is often found on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread to new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural and ornamental crops.</p>
