                    <h1>Cryophytum arenarium</h1>
<p>Cryophytum arenarium, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense mat of small, fleshy, green leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise muted appearance. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant.</p>
