                    <h1>Cuscuta umbellata var. maritima</h1>
<p>Cuscuta umbellata var. maritima, commonly known as the sea dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is typically found in coastal areas, where it attaches to grasses and other low-growing vegetation. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas along shorelines.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants, making it a concern in agricultural and natural ecosystems.</p>
