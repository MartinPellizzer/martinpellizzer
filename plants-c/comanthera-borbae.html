<p>Comanthera borbae, commonly known as the Borba's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within dense tropical forests. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Comanthera borbae is considered critically endangered.</p>
