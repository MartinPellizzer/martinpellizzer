                    <h1>Carex breviculmis f. filiculmis</h1>
<p>Carex breviculmis f. filiculmis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedges, is a variant of the Carex genus characterized by its compact, grass-like appearance.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in width, giving it a delicate, refined look. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along stream edges.</p>
<p>This sedge is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
