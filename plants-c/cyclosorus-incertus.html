                    <h1>Cyclosorus incertus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus incertus, commonly known as the uncertain cyclosorus, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Peltasporaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, thalloid plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant's structure consists of a leafy thallus with a central axis and lateral branches, characteristic of many liverworts. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on specialized stalks called sporophytes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and morphological similarities to other species, Cyclosorus incertus remains a subject of taxonomic debate among botanists.</p>
