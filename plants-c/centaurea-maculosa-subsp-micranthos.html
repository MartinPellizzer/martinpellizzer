<p>Centaurea maculosa subsp.</p>
<p>micranthos, commonly known as the spotted knapweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive purple to pink flowers and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>The plant has lance-shaped leaves with white markings and produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land management.</p>
