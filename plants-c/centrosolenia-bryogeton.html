                    <h1>Centrosolenia bryogeton</h1>
<p>Centrosolenia bryogeton, commonly known as the mossy liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leaf-like structures that are typically arranged in a dense, carpet-like growth pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture through its entire surface. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, develop from specialized leaves called calyptrae.</p>
<p>Centrosolenia bryogeton plays an important role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its native habitats.</p>
