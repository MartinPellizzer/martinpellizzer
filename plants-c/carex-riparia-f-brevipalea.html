                    <h1>Carex riparia f. brevipalea</h1>
<p>Carex riparia f. brevipalea, commonly known as the narrow-pale sedge, is a variant of the common sedge found in wetland and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are shorter and more compact compared to the typical form. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often near streams or in marshy areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
