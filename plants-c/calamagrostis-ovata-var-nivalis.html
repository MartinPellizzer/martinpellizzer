                    <h1>Calamagrostis ovata var. nivalis</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis ovata var. nivalis, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in cold, moist environments. The plant produces slender, silver-blue to white plumes that give it a distinctive appearance, especially during the late summer and autumn months. It is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along the edges of lakes and rivers.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes for its aesthetic and habitat-supporting qualities.</p>
