<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its globular shape and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry environments.</p>
<p>Colletia disperma plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
