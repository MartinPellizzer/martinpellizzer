<p>Cactus quadrispinus, commonly known as the four-spine cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its roots are shallow and adapted to quickly absorb rainfall, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Overall, Cactus quadrispinus plays an important ecological role in its environment by providing shelter and food for various desert wildlife.</p>
