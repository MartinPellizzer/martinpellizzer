                    <h1>Corylus cornuta</h1>
<p>Corylus cornuta, commonly known as the horned hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky husks that encase its edible nuts, which are typically harvested in the fall. The plant produces yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by female flowers that develop into the characteristic horn-shaped fruits. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the autumn.</p>
<p>Corylus cornuta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks.</p>
