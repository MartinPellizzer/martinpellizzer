                    <h1>Coleotrype udzungwaensis</h1>
<p>Coleotrype udzungwaensis, commonly known as the Udzungwa shield-fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found exclusively in the Udzungwa Mountains of Tanzania.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in dense, velvety hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded microhabitats within montane forests, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its specialized ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
