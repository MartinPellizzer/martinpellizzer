<p>Cupressus sargentii var. duttonii, commonly known as the Dutton's lacebark cypress, is a rare and ornamental evergreen conifer native to the coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely textured, feathery foliage and distinctive, flaky, peeling bark that gives it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 15 feet, with a conical or broadly pyramidal shape. Its cones are small and woody, and it produces both male and female cones on the same plant.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal and adaptability to coastal conditions.</p>
