                    <h1>Cyclobalanopsis lineata var. grandifolia</h1>
<p>Cyclobalanopsis lineata var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hard, dense wood and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by woody, oblong fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland and hill forests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and durable timber, it is valued for both ecological and commercial purposes.</p>
