<p>Caribea litoralis, commonly known as the beach hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>

The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and mangrove swamps.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening and for erosion control in coastal areas.</p>
