                            <h1>Chamelaucium Repens</h1>
<p>Coastal banksia, scientifically known as Chamelaucium repens, is a unique evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. This plant is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray, strong winds, and sandy soils. It features dense, leathery leaves that help it conserve water and withstand extreme weather. The plant produces small, pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. Due to its ecological importance and resilience, Chamelaucium repens plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
