<p>Chiococca alba var. parvifolia, commonly known as the white cacao tree, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen tree with smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that are alternate and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic relationship to cacao, making it a subject of study for cocoa cultivation and biodiversity conservation.</p>
