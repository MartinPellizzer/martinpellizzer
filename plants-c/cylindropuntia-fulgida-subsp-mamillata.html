<p>Cylindropuntia fulgida subsp.</p>
<p>mamillata, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rounded, cylindrical stem that is covered in dense, yellowish spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stem. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for desert gardens.</p>
