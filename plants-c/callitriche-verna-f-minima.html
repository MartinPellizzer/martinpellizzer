                    <h1>Callitriche verna f. minima</h1>
<p>Callitriche verna f. minima, commonly known as the small spring starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the Callitriche genus in the family Hydrocharitaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers and narrow, ribbon-like leaves that often float on the water's surface. This plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and the edges of lakes. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing small, white or pale pink flowers that attract pollinators like bees and flies.</p>
<p>The subspecies minima is distinguished by its smaller size compared to other forms of Callitriche verna.</p>
