<p>Corethrodendron fruticosum var. lignosum, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline, waterlogged soils. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy fruits.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
