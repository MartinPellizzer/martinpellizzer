                    <h1>Cyperus helodes</h1>
<p>Cyperus helodes, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial wetland plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread rapidly in wet environments. It is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and rivers.</p>
<p>Its adaptability makes it both an important part of wetland ecosystems and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
