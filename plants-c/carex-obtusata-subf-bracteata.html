<p>Carex obtusata subf.</p>
<p>bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is typically found in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
