<p>Campanula aspera, commonly known as the rough bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name "aspera," meaning rough in Latin. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Campanula aspera is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
