<p>Cordylogyne mossambicense, commonly known as the Mozambique liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically green and covered in a layer of protective wax. This moss thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, produce spores that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Cordylogyne mossambicense plays a vital role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitat.</p>
