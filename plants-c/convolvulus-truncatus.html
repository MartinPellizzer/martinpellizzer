                    <h1>Convolvulus truncatus</h1>
<p>Convolvulus truncatus, commonly known as the cut-leaved morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are often notched or truncate at the ends. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in the early morning. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common weed in agricultural fields and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>The genus Convolvulus includes many species with similar morphological traits, but Convolvulus truncatus is distinguished by its unique leaf shape and flowering pattern.</p>
