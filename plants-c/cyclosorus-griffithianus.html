                    <h1>Cyclosorus griffithianus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus griffithianus, commonly known as the Griffith's waterwheel, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has a distinctive root system that helps stabilize the substrate and prevent erosion. Its reproductive structures are typically found in the water, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and pollution, Cyclosorus griffithianus is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
