                            <h1>Carum Hookeri</h1>
<p>Hooker's caraway, scientifically known as Carum hookeri, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. This member of the Apiaceae family is characterized by its slender stems, small white or greenish flowers, and aromatic, feathery leaves. Found primarily in alpine and subalpine habitats, it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Hooker's caraway is now considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a fascinating subject for botanical study and environmental protection.</p>
