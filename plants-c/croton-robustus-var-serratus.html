<p>Croton robustus var. serratus, commonly known as the serrated croton, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange to red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary appeal lies in its striking foliage.</p>
