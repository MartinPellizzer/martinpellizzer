<p>Carex flava var. rectirostra, commonly known as the yellow sedges, is a variant of the yellow sedge species native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellowish-green foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that mature into brown, cylindrical clusters. This plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization and wetland ecosystem health.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and the plant is often used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
