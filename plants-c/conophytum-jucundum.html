<p>Conophytum jucundum, commonly known as the "Happy Stone," is a species of succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, stone-like leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It is often cultivated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Conophytum jucundum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
