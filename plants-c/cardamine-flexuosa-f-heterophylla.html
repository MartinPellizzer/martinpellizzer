                    <h1>Cardamine flexuosa f. heterophylla</h1>
<p>Cardamine flexuosa f. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable water shield, is a rare and distinctive fern-like plant native to specific wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its unique, often lobed leaves that vary in shape and size, giving it its "heterophylla" designation. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into berries, which are dispersed by water or animals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
