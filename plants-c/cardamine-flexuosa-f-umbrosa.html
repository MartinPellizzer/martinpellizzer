                    <h1>Cardamine flexuosa f. umbrosa</h1>
<p>Cardamine flexuosa f. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving water cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating in still or slow-moving water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in early spring. Its rhizomes are frequently used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic properties.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its preference for low-light conditions and its ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
