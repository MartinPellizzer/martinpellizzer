                    <h1>Conopholis ludoviciana</h1>
<p>Conopholis ludoviciana, commonly known as the scarlet gourd, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain wildlife species.</p>
