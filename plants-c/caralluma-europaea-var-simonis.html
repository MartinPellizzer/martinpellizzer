<p>Caralluma europaea var. simonis, commonly known as the European horned cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.

It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
