<p>Centropogon diocleus, commonly known as the red sandalwood or Diocleous sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its woody structure and ornamental flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers. Its bark and wood have been historically valued for their aromatic properties and use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in many parts of its native range.</p>
