<p>Caralluma stalagmifera, commonly known as the rock fig or desert fig, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Caralluma stalagmifera is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional remedies for various health purposes.</p>
