                    <h1>Cuscuta veatchii var. typica</h1>
<p>Cuscuta veatchii var. typica, commonly known as the veatch's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of slender, thread-like stems. The plant is native to the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico, where it commonly parasitizes various shrubs and herbs. Its life cycle involves germination, attachment to a host, and the formation of specialized structures called haustoria to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, though it can sometimes be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
