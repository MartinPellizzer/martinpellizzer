<p>Ceratochloa breviaristata, commonly known as the narrow-awned fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant produces delicate, awned glumes that give it its common name, and its leaves are narrow and often hairy. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects or as a forage plant.</p>
