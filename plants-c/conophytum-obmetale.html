<p>Conophytum obmetale, commonly known as the "cushion stonecrop," is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth habit, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water. The leaves are typically green or bluish-green, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
