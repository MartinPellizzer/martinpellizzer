<p>Cyperus cremeomariscus, commonly known as the pink flatsedge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale pink to white flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common wetland species.</p>
<p>Cyperus cremeomariscus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments.</p>
