                    <h1>Cytisus purpureus var. albiflorus</h1>
<p>Cytisus purpureus var. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered broom, is a flowering shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thorned stems and compound leaves composed of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is distinct from the typical Cytisus purpureus due to its pale, almost white floral coloration.</p>
