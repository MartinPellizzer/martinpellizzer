<p>Chuniophoenix humilis, commonly known as the dwarf date palm, is a small, slow-growing palm native to the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of about 3 to 5 meters and has a short, slender trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish-white flowers, which eventually develop into edible dates. Its leaves are pinnate, with long, narrow segments that give it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
