<p>Cypripedium ebracteatum, commonly known as the nakedleaf lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped flower that is typically pink or white in color. The plant has a distinctive lack of leaf-like bracts, giving it its common name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
