                    <h1>Codiaeum ludovicianum var. rheophyticum</h1>
<p>Codiaeum ludovicianum var. rheophyticum, commonly known as the waterfall croton, is a striking tropical plant native to the humid regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, variegated foliage with shades of green, yellow, and red, which enhances its ornamental appeal. This variant is particularly adapted to moist, shaded environments, often growing near waterfalls or in stream-side habitats. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The plant is popular in horticulture for its dramatic appearance and ability to thrive in semi-shaded, humid conditions.</p>
