                    <h1>Cocos arechavaletana</h1>
<p>Cocos arechavaletana, commonly known as the Arechavaleta coconut, is a rare and lesser-known species of coconut palm native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tall trunk and elongated, narrow leaves that give it a distinct appearance compared to more common coconut varieties. The plant produces small, hairy fruits that contain a single, edible kernel, similar to other coconut species. It thrives in coastal areas with well-drained soil and is adapted to the unique climate of the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
