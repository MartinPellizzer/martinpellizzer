                    <h1>Casearia hydnocarpoides</h1>
<p>Casearia hydnocarpoides, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical shrub native to the coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black, bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that develop into fleshy, orange-red berries. Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in mangrove ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing shorelines.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
