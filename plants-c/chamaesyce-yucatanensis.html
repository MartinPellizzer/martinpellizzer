<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, blooming in the spring. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to the harsh, dry environment of its native habitat.</p>
