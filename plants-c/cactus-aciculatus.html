                    <h1>Cactus aciculatus</h1>
<p>Cactus aciculatus, commonly known as the needle cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are adapted to store water and minimize water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing transpiration and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Cactus aciculatus is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, dry environments.</p>
