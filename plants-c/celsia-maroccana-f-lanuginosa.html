The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered threatened in the wild.</p>
