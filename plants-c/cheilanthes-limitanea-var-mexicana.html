                    <h1>Cheilanthes limitanea var. mexicana</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes limitanea var. mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its succulent-like leaves. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
