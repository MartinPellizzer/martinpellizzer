                            <h1>Citronella Moorei</h1>
<p>Citronella, scientifically known as Citronella moorei, is a tropical plant widely recognized for its strong lemony scent and medicinal properties. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its essential oils. The plant's leaves contain high concentrations of citronellol, which is used in natural repellents against mosquitoes and other insects. Its versatility extends beyond pest control, as it is also used in aromatherapy and traditional medicine. Despite its benefits, Citronella requires careful handling due to its potential to cause skin irritation.</p>
