                    <h1>Centaurea acaulis</h1>
<p>Centaurea acaulis, commonly known as the cushion centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing, mat-forming structure, which helps it survive in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Centaurea acaulis is often used in rock gardens and as a ornamental plant due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
