                    <h1>Cinnagrostis divergens</h1>
<p>Cinnagrostis divergens, commonly known as the divergent sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Cinnagrostis divergens is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
