<p>Cytinus hypocistis subsp.</p>
<p>canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Island snailwort, is a unique parasitic plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, rounded stem that resembles a snail's shell.</p>
<p>The plant lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to the roots of host plants, drawing nutrients through a haustorium. Its flowers are small and typically pale pink or white, and it blooms during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its specialized parasitic lifestyle and limited geographic distribution.</p>
