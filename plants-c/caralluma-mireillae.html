                    <h1>Caralluma mireillae</h1>
<p>Caralluma mireillae, commonly known as the Mireille's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, paddle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season, followed by edible, red fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Caralluma mireillae is valued for its resilience and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
