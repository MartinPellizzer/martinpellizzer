<p>Cyclosorus remotipinnus, commonly known as the slender water clover, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, often forming dense mats. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, and it produces tiny, green fruits that contain several seeds. It is commonly found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize water bodies, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
