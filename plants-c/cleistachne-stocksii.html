The plant produces tiny, often invisible flowers that are enclosed within the spikelets, a feature typical of many grasses. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
