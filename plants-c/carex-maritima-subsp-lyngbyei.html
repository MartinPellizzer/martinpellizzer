<p>Carex maritima subsp.</p>
<p>lyngbyei, commonly known as the Lyngby's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of northern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes or salt marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to saline environments, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
