                    <h1>Cecropia pacis</h1>
<p>Cecropia pacis, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a fast-growing, evergreen shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, waxy leaves that have a velvety texture, and its distinctive, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings due to its rapid growth rate and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Cecropia pacis is also notable for its association with ants, which reside in the hollow stems and provide protection against herbivores.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its role as a pioneer species in forest succession and its contribution to local biodiversity.</p>
