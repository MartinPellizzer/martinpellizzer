<p>Citrus hystrix var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf citron, is a compact, shrub-like citrus plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant has dark green, glossy leaves and produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and citrus scent.</p>
