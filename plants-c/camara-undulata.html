<p>Camara undulata, commonly known as the wavy camara, is a flowering plant belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive wavy-lobed leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals.

<p>Its ornamental value is limited due to its toxic properties, but it is studied for its potential medicinal compounds.</p>
