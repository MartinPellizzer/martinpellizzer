                    <h1>Cyperus pygmaeus</h1>
<p>Cyperus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf papyrus, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, making it a low-growing species. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its natural environment.</p>
<p>Cyperus pygmaeus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
