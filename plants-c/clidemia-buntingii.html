                    <h1>Clidemia buntingii</h1>
<p>Clidemia buntingii, commonly known as the Bunting's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and white, tubular flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and ecological role, it plays a significant part in the biodiversity of its native habitats.</p>
