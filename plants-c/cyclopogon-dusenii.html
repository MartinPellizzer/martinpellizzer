                    <h1>Cyclopogon dusenii</h1>
<p>Cyclopogon dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's cyclopogon, is a rare and endangered bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, spathate inflorescence that is often brightly colored, typically in shades of red or orange. The plant has a rosette-shaped leaf structure that helps it collect and store water in its native humid environment. It thrives in shaded, moist conditions and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of the forest.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
