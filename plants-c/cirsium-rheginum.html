<p>Cirsium rheginum, commonly known as the Edible Thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a robust, spiny stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with large, silvery-green, woolly leaves that are often covered in prickles. The plant produces showy purple to pink flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves and young shoots are edible when properly prepared, though they contain irritants that require careful handling.</p>
<p>Cirsium rheginum is often found in dry grasslands, rocky slopes, and along coastal areas.</p>
