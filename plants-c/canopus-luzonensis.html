<p>Canopus luzonensis, commonly known as the Luzon canopoid, is a rare flowering plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cantharellaceae and is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped yellow-orange fruiting bodies. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded forest environments, where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its structure includes a delicate stem with a cup-like base that supports the fruiting body.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Canopus luzonensis is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
