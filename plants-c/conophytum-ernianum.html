                    <h1>Conophytum ernianum</h1>
<p>Conophytum ernianum, commonly known as the "Cushion Stonecrop," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant forms a low-growing, cushion-like structure, which helps it retain moisture and protect against harsh weather. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Conophytum ernianum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
