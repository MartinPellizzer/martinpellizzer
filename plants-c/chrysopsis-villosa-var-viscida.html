                    <h1>Chrysopsis villosa var. viscida</h1>
<p>Chrysopsis villosa var. viscida, commonly known as the woolly goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and disturbed areas. Its hairy stems and leaves provide a protective layer against water loss, adapting it to harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance.</p>
