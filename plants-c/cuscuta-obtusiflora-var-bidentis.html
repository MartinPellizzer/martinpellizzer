                    <h1>Cuscuta obtusiflora var. bidentis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta obtusiflora var. bidentis, commonly known as the two-toothed dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating on the surface of host plants. The plant's stems are slender and twining, allowing it to attach to and feed from various host species. It is native to North America and can be found in a variety of habitats, including fields and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
