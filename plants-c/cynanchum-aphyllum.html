                    <h1>Cynanchum aphyllum</h1>
<p>Cynanchum aphyllum, commonly known as the leafless milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive lack of leaves, with only a few small, scale-like structures at the base of the stem. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its stems are covered in fine, white hairs, and the plant exudes a milky sap when damaged.</p>
<p>Cynanchum aphyllum is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
