                    <h1>Cuscuta planiflora var. mossamedensis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta planiflora var. mossamedensis, commonly known as the flatleaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to parts of Africa and is often found growing on grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
