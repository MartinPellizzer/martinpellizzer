<p>Cypripedium × euryandrum, commonly known as the hybrid yellow lady's slipper, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is prized for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Cypripedium calceolus (the showy lady's slipper) and Cypripedium flavum (the yellow lady's slipper), resulting in a plant with distinctive yellow and green floral structures. The plant is characterized by its large, pouch-like lip and showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>Due to its beauty and rarity, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists.</p>
