<p>Campanula rotundifolia var. marchesettii, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a perennial herb native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features showy, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has rounded, toothed leaves that are typically covered in a fine, woolly coating. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in areas with standing water or saturated ground.</p>
