                    <h1>Cuscuta diaphana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta diaphana, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves attaching to host plants through specialized haustoria. The plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, where it parasitizes a variety of herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread across different habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Cuscuta diaphana plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant populations and contributing to seed dispersal.</p>
