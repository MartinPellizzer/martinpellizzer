                    <h1>Cheilanthes macleanii</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes macleanii, commonly known as the Maclean's rockcap, is a species of fern native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It is adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments, often growing on exposed limestone or sandstone.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and resilience make it a notable example of xerophytic adaptation in ferns.</p>
