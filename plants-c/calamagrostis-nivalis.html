                    <h1>Calamagrostis nivalis</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis nivalis, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, helping it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral display. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Calamagrostis nivalis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic animals.</p>
