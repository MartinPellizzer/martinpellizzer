<p>Crypsinna setiglumis, commonly known as the slender-leaved cryptogram, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers arranged in clusters at the base of the stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
