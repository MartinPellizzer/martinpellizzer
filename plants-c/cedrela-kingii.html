<p>Cedrela kingii, commonly known as African teak, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its straight, durable wood that is highly valued for its strength and resistance to decay. The tree typically grows to a height of 20â€“30 meters and has simple, alternate leaves with a lanceolate shape. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing flat, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overexploitation, Cedrela kingii is now listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List.</p>
