<p>Commiphora drake-brockmanii, commonly known as the Drake-Brockman's myrrh, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the arid regions of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh-producing trees. The plant is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces a resin that has been historically used in traditional medicine. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to extreme environmental conditions, making it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
