                    <h1>Carex aridula</h1>
<p>Carex aridula, commonly known as the desert sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically grouped in spikelets, which are clustered at the ends of its stems. Carex aridula is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in low-water environments.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
