                    <h1>Cardamine macrorrhiza</h1>
<p>Cardamine macrorrhiza, commonly known as the large-veined watercress, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant produces small white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively in moist environments.</p>
<p>Cardamine macrorrhiza is often found in shallow water, stream edges, and marshy areas, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystem dynamics.</p>
