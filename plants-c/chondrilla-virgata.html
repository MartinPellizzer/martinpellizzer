<p>Chondrilla virgata, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through its deep root system and ability to store water in its stems. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Chondrilla virgata plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
