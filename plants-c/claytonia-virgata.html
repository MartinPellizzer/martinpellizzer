                    <h1>Claytonia virgata</h1>
<p>Claytonia virgata, commonly known as the spring beauty, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters and features a basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, usually blooming in early spring. Its leaves are succulent and often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often moist, woodland habitat.</p>
<p>Claytonia virgata is adapted to thrive in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a common sight in forest understories.</p>
