                    <h1>Caralluma peckii</h1>
<p>Caralluma peckii, commonly known as the Indian date cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Peraceae and is characterized by its fleshy, spineless stems that store water, adapting to its harsh desert environment. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, edible fruits resembling dates. Caralluma peckii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in folk medicine.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in low-water conditions makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping in drought-prone areas.</p>
