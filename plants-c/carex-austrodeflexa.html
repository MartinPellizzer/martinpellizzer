                    <h1>Carex austrodeflexa</h1>
<p>Carex austrodeflexa, commonly known as the southern flexed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as swamps and margins of water bodies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly folded, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
