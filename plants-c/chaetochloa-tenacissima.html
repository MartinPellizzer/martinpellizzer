                    <h1>Chaetochloa tenacissima</h1>
<p>Chaetochloa tenacissima, commonly known as the hardstem bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it plays an important ecological role in arid regions.</p>
