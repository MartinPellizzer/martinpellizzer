                <h1>Cinna agrostoides</h1>
<p>Cinna agrostoides, commonly known as the grass-like fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often mistaken for true grasses, but it possesses the characteristic fronds of a fern. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cinna agrostoides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, partially shaded conditions.</p>
