<p>Circaea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>intermedia, commonly known as the alpine woodruff, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July.</p>
<p>The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its ability to adapt to high-altitude conditions and its role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
