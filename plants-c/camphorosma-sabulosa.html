                    <h1>Camphorosma sabulosa</h1>
<p>Camphorosma sabulosa, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Camphorosma sabulosa plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing dunes in coastal and desert ecosystems.</p>
