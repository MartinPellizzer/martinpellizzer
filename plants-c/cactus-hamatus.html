                    <h1>Cactus hamatus</h1>
<p>Cactus hamatus, commonly known as the spiny cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ribbed, cylindrical stems that are covered in sharp, spiny tubercles, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptations to extreme environments include a thick, waxy cuticle and the ability to store water in its stems.</p>
<p>Cactus hamatus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance.</p>
