                    <h1>Ctenopteris xanthotrichia</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris xanthotrichia, commonly known as the golden-haired sea palm, is a marine fern belonging to the family Cystothecaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden-brown coating of spores. This plant thrives in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates using its rhizomes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sorus, are clustered along the fronds and contribute to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Ctenopteris xanthotrichia plays an important ecological role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various small aquatic organisms.</p>
