                    <h1>Culhamia</h1>
<p>Culhamia, commonly known as the Culham water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy layer that helps repel water, while its roots anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>Culhamia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
