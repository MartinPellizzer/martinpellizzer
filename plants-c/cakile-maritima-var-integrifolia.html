<p>Cakile maritima var. integrifolia, commonly known as the coastal rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the western coast of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and has small, pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.

It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds.</p>
<p>Its robust root system helps stabilize dunes and prevent erosion in coastal environments.</p>
