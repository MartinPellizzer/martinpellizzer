<p>Chelonopsis albiflora var. cashmerica, commonly known as the Cashmere Chelonopsis, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white-pink flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle elegance to its foliage. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, which helps reflect sunlight in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts.</p>
