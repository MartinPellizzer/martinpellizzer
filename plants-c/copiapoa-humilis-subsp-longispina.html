<p>Copiapoa humilis subsp.</p>
<p>longispina, commonly known as the long-spined copiapoa, is a low-growing cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its spines are long and straight, providing protection from herbivores and aiding in shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
