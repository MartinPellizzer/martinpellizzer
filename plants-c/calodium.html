                    <h1>Calodium</h1>
<p>Calodium, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of coniferous trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which then spread its seeds to new host trees. Calodium lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients directly from its host through specialized structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, making it an important component of forest ecosystems.</p>
