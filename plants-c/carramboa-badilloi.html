<p>Carramboa badilloi, commonly known as the Sierra Madre daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Carramboa badilloi is often found in rocky slopes and sandy soils, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats.</p>
