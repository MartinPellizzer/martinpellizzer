                    <h1>Chamaesyce prostrata</h1>
<p>Chamaesyce prostrata, commonly known as creeping sandwort, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across disturbed soils. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers in early spring. It is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural or landscaped areas.</p>
