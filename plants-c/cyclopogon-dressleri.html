                    <h1>Cyclopogon dressleri</h1>
<p>Cyclopogon dressleri, commonly known as the Mexican bird's nest orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and its distinctive inflorescence that resembles a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Cyclopogon dressleri is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
