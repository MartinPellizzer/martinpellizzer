<p>Ciconium umbellatum, commonly known as the umbrella fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its feathery, arching fronds that resemble an umbrella.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions with high humidity and warm climates. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in shaded environments.</p>
<p>Ciconium umbellatum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance and air-purifying qualities.</p>
