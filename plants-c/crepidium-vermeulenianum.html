                    <h1>Crepidium vermeulenianum</h1>
<p>Crepidium vermeulenianum, commonly known as the Vermeulen's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
