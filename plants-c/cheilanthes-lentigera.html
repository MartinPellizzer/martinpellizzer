                    <h1>Cheilanthes lentigera</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes lentigera, commonly known as the spotted rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 10 inches in length. The plant has a distinctive appearance with dark, velvety, spore-bearing leaves that are often covered in small, dark spots. It thrives in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in harsh environments.</p>
