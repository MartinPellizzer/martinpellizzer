<p>Caralluma vaduliae, commonly known as the Desert Caper, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Caralluma vaduliae is adapted to extreme temperatures and can thrive with minimal rainfall.</p>
