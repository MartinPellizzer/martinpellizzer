                    <h1>Caralluma melanantha var. sousae</h1>
<p>Caralluma melanantha var. sousae, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, spine-tipped stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, further reducing water loss.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in low-water gardening settings.</p>
