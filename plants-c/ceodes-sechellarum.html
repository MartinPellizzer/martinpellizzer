<p>Ceodes sechellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles ceodes, is a rare endemic plant found exclusively on the Seychelles Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by dark, berry-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species.</p>
