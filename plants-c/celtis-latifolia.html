                    <h1>Celtis latifolia</h1>
<p>Celtis latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern and southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by spherical, green fruits that ripen to a dark purple color. Celtis latifolia is often found in moist bottomlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
<p>It is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in urban landscapes due to its tolerance of poor soil conditions.</p>
