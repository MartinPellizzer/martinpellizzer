<p>Citharexylum × perkinsii, commonly known as the Christmas bush, is a hybrid evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features dense, fragrant foliage with small, leathery leaves that are often used in floral arrangements. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and moderate drought.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its evergreen nature and seasonal flowering.</p>
