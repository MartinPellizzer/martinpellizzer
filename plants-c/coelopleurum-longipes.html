                    <h1>Coelopleurum longipes</h1>
<p>Coelopleurum longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it relies on its specialized bladders for nutrient acquisition.</p>
<p>Coelopleurum longipes plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web through both its prey capture and decomposition.</p>
