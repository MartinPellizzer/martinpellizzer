<p>Cryptobasis cathayensis, commonly known as the Chinese cryptobasis, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and other related plants. The plant is characterized by its upright, slender stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces tiny, greenish flowers that are typically inconspicuous and not showy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cryptobasis cathayensis is of interest to botanists studying plant diversity and adaptation in mountainous environments.</p>
