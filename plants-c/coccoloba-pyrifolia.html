<p>Coccoloba pyrifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often mistaken for those of the hibiscus due to their similar appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Coccoloba pyrifolia thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful ornamental plant and an invasive species in some regions.</p>
