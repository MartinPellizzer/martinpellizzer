                    <h1>Cladium procerum</h1>
<p>Cladium procerum, commonly known as the tall sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland ecosystems in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in terminal spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in marshy environments.</p>
<p>Cladium procerum plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms.</p>
