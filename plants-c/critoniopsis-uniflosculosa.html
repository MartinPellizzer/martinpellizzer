                    <h1>Critoniopsis uniflosculosa</h1>
<p>Critoniopsis uniflosculosa, commonly known as the single-flower clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate, and often clustered sporophylls that bear the spores. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are specialized, with each sporophyll producing a single, small sporangium.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Critoniopsis uniflosculosa is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
