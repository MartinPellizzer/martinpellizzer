                    <h1>Cremaspora maxima</h1>
<p>Cremaspora maxima, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, floating leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing shade over water surfaces. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink, which bloom at night and emit a strong scent to attract pollinators. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in shallow waters while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Cremaspora maxima plays an important ecological role by supporting aquatic life and contributing to water quality through oxygenation.</p>
