<p>Castilleja pratensis, commonly known as the meadow castilleja, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in fine hairs, and it typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Castilleja pratensis plays a role in supporting pollinators and contributes to the ecological diversity of its native range.</p>
