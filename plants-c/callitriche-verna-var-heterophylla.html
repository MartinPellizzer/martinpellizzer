                    <h1>Callitriche verna var. heterophylla</h1>
<p>Callitriche verna var. heterophylla, commonly known as spring water-starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often floating or partially submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are usually oval or lance-shaped. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are typically white or pale blue in color.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its morphological differences in leaf shape and size compared to the typical form of Callitriche verna.</p>
