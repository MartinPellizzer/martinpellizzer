                    <h1>Claytonia prostrata</h1>
<p>Claytonia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate springbeauty, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its often dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which bloom close to the ground. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a characteristic species of open, sunny areas.</p>
<p>Claytonia prostrata is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly environments.</p>
