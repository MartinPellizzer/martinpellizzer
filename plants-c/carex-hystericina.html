                    <h1>Carex hystericina</h1>
<p>Carex hystericina, commonly known as the silver hair sedge, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that features a distinctive silvery-gray hue due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures on the leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous brown flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Carex hystericina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
