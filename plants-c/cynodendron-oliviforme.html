                    <h1>Cynodendron oliviforme</h1>
<p>Cynodendron oliviforme, commonly known as the oval-leaf cycad, is a unique plant native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades. Its reproductive structures, including a large, cone-like structure, are typical of cycads, which are ancient seed plants.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it an important species for studying the evolution of gymnosperms.</p>
