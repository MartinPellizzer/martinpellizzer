<p>Crypsinus craspedosorus, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with high levels of atmospheric moisture. The plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow-orange flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns resembling flames. Its leaves are typically broad and glossy, adapted to capture as much light as possible in its low-light habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Crypsinus craspedosorus is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
