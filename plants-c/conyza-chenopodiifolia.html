                    <h1>Conyza chenopodiifolia</h1>
<p>Conyza chenopodiifolia, commonly known as desert star or silverleaf ironweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“100 cm, with silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are lanceolate and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Conyza chenopodiifolia is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural areas.</p>
