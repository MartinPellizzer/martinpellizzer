                    <h1>Cakile maritima var. auriculata</h1>
<p>Cakile maritima var. auriculata, commonly known as the golden beach mustard, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual plant that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by pods containing several seeds. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in saline environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize coastal dunes.</p>
