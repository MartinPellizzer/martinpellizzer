<p>Cyclosorus rurutensis, commonly known as the Rurut's cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in shallow, freshwater habitats. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a creeping rhizome and small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus rurutensis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
