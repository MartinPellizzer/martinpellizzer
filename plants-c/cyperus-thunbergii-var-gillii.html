                    <h1>Cyperus thunbergii var. gillii</h1>
<p>Cyperus thunbergii var. gillii, commonly known as the variegated flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves with distinctive variegation, often displaying white or yellow markings along the midribs. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically inconspicuous, characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species in its native habitat.</p>
