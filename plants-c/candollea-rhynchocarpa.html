                    <h1>Candollea rhynchocarpa</h1>
<p>Candollea rhynchocarpa, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, horn-like structures on its floral bracts, which give it its common name. Native to the Andean regions of South America, this plant thrives in high-altitude cloud forests. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often blooming during the cooler months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Candollea rhynchocarpa is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
