                    <h1>Calisto</h1>
<p>Calisto, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale blue, almost translucent petals that resemble the color of the moon, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant has a short flowering period, typically blooming only once every few years, which makes it highly sought after by botanists and collectors. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Calisto is also noted for its unique fragrance, which is described as a mix of citrus and spice, adding to its allure.</p>
