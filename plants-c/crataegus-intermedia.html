<p>Crataegus intermedia, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and mammals. Crataegus intermedia is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along streambanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable component of both ecological and ornamental landscapes.</p>
