                    <h1>Cylindropuntia fulgida f. cristata</h1>
<p>Cylindropuntia fulgida f. cristata, commonly known as the cristate hedgehog cactus, is a unique variant of the hedgehog cactus species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, flattened, rib-like structure that gives it a distinctive, almost geometric appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual element to its form. Native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its modified stems, known as areoles, bear clusters of spines and are adapted for water storage and photosynthesis.</p>
