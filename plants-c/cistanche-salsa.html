<p>Cistanche salsa, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic plant that grows primarily in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host plants for nutrients. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers and has a unique structure with a stem that wraps around its host. It is often found in the wild in areas such as China, Mongolia, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>Due to its medicinal properties, it is also cultivated for use in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
