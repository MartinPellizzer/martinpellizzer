                    <h1>Centropappus</h1>
<p>Centropappus, commonly known as the "safflower" or "false sunflower," is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, and they are well-adapted to dry environments. Centropappus species typically have hairy, gray-green leaves and produce bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant's unique seed heads, which resemble small parachutes, aid in wind dispersal of its seeds.</p>
<p>Many species are grown for their ornamental value and some have been used in traditional medicine.</p>
