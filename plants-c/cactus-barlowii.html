                    <h1>Cactus barlowii</h1>
<p>Cactus barlowii, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Cactus barlowii is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
