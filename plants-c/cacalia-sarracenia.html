                    <h1>Cacalia sarracenia</h1>
<p>Cacalia sarracenia, commonly known as the purple pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, tubular leaves that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's vibrant purple coloration is due to its rich pigmentation, which also helps attract prey. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires consistently moist conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
