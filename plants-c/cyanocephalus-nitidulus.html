                    <h1>Cyanocephalus nitidulus</h1>
<p>Cyanocephalus nitidulus, commonly known as the blue-headed cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and blue-tinted stems that give it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often clustered at the top of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a typical adaptation to its harsh, dry environment.</p>
<p>Cyanocephalus nitidulus is well adapted to survive in low-water conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat.</p>
