                    <h1>Chaetospora aurata</h1>
<p>Chaetospora aurata, commonly known as the golden coral moss, is a unique liverwort species characterized by its intricate, branching structure that resembles coral.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocks or decaying wood in temperate regions. The plant's leaves are small, overlapping, and often have a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, are borne on stalks and release spores into the air.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is often overlooked but plays a vital role in forest ecosystems.</p>
