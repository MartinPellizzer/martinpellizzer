                    <h1>Coffea jumellei</h1>
<p>Coffea jumellei, commonly known as the Jamaican coffee or Jamaican bitter bean, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica, and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain two seeds, which are used to make a unique, bitter coffee. It is less commonly cultivated than other coffee species due to its low yield and strong flavor profile.</p>
<p>Despite its limited commercial use, Coffea jumellei holds cultural significance in the Caribbean region.</p>
