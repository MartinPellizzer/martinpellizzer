<p>Carex goodenowii subsp.</p>
<p>stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and pond edges.</p>
<p>The plant features grass-like leaves that are generally narrow and grass-green in color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>The stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
