<p>Cibotium spectabile, commonly known as the golden tree fern, is a striking evergreen plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its tall, tree-like structure with a stout, fibrous trunk covered in a layer of dead fronds. The plant produces large, shield-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Cibotium spectabile is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in shaded, moist environments with well-drained soil.</p>
