                    <h1>Cynometra koko</h1>
<p>Cynometra koko, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local carpentry and furniture making.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
