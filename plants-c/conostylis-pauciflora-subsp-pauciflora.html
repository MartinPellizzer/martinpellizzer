<p>Conostylis pauciflora subsp.</p>
<p>pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered conostylis, is a low-growing, perennial herb native to southeastern Australia. It typically features a basal rosette of narrow, grey-green leaves and produces small, pale blue or white flowers in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. It has a compact growth habit and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
