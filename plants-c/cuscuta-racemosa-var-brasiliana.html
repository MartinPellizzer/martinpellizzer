                    <h1>Cuscuta racemosa var. brasiliana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta racemosa var. brasiliana, commonly known as the Brazilian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous yellow or green flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to South America and is often found growing on various shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
