<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and features small, dark green, leathery fronds. Native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, it thrives in rocky, arid environments. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in crevices and store water.</p>
