                    <h1>Crepidopteris humilis</h1>
<p>Crepidopteris humilis, commonly known as the spider fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a pale underside. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
