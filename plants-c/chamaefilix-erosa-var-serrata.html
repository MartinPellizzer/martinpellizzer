                    <h1>Chamaefilix erosa var. serrata</h1>
<p>Chamaefilix erosa var. serrata, commonly known as rough rocksam, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, leathery leaves that have serrated edges, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, five-petaled flowers in early summer, which are arranged in compact inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with poor soil conditions.</p>
