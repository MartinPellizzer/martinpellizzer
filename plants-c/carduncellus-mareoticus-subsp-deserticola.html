<p>Carduncellus mareoticus subsp.</p>
<p>deserticola, commonly known as the desert carduncellus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the arid regions of the Sahara. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the brief rainy season.</p>
<p>The plant has adapted to extreme desert conditions through deep root systems and water-storing tissues. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in isolated oases or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
