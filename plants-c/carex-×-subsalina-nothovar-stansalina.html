                    <h1>Carex × subsalina nothovar. stansalina</h1>
<p>Carex × subsalina nothovar. stansalina, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex subulata and Carex salina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish-brown flowers. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in wetland or marshy environments. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
<p>The nothovar. stansalina is a naturally occurring variant that exhibits traits from both parent species.</p>
