                    <h1>Cayratia roxburghii</h1>
<p>Cayratia roxburghii, commonly known as the climbing lychee or Chinese jujube vine, is a vigorous climbing plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in taste to lychees, though less commonly consumed.

<p>Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for trellises and living fences.</p>
