                    <h1>Carphopappus</h1>
<p>Carphopappus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of blue-green, woolly leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Carphopappus species are typically drought-tolerant and have adapted to harsh desert environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area.</p>
<p>They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in their native habitats.</p>
