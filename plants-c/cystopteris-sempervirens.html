                    <h1>Cystopteris sempervirens</h1>
<p>Cystopteris sempervirens, commonly known as the evergreen water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically evergreen, giving it a lush, green appearance throughout the year. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or near water sources. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid environments.</p>
