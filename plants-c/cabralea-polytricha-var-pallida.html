The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale pink or white, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
