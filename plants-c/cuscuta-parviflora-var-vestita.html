                    <h1>Cuscuta parviflora var. vestita</h1>
<p>Cuscuta parviflora var. vestita, commonly known as the white dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is often found growing on agricultural crops and weeds, making it a common weed in cultivated fields. Its seeds are tiny and can remain viable in the soil for many years, contributing to its persistent presence.</p>
<p>The species is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is widely distributed across Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
