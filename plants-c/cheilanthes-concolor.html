<p>Cheilanthes concolor, commonly known as the smooth rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and covered with a dense layer of trichomes. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is often found growing on cliffs or among limestone outcrops. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its ability to colonize harsh environments.</p>
