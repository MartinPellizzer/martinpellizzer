                    <h1>Chloris circumfontinalis</h1>
<p>Chloris circumfontinalis, commonly known as the coastal bluegrass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along the shoreline.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
