<p>Culcitium uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower culcitium, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, solitary flower that blooms in a vibrant shade of red or orange, making it a visually distinctive species. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Culcitium uniflorum is considered a conservation concern.</p>
