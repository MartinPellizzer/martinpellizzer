                    <h1>Cuscuta pentagona var. calycina</h1>
<p>Cuscuta pentagona var. calycina, commonly known as the calycine dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed dispersal and host attachment. The plant is characterized by its thread-like stems that coil around host plants, often causing damage to agricultural crops. It is native to North America and is commonly found in fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique parasitic adaptations and role in ecological interactions.</p>
