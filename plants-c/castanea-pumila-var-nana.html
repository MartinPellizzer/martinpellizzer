                    <h1>Castanea pumila var. nana</h1>
<p>Castanea pumila var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf chestnut, is a low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, spiny leaves and produces edible, chestnut-like fruits that mature in the fall. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in woodland areas. It has a short stature, typically reaching only a few inches in height, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic resource for chestnut restoration efforts.</p>
