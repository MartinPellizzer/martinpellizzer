                    <h1>Cissus crenata</h1>
<p>Cissus crenata, commonly known as the creeping fig or snow vine, is a vine species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to climb or spread across surfaces. The plant features heart-shaped, waxy leaves with a distinctive crenate margin, and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Cissus crenata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to cover trellises or walls.</p>
