<p>Chuquiraga lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's chuquiraga, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features silver-gray foliage with a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Chuquiraga lehmannii is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, sunny conditions.</p>
