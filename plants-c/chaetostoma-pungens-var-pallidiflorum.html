                    <h1>Chaetostoma pungens var. pallidiflorum</h1>
<p>Chaetostoma pungens var. pallidiflorum, commonly known as the paleflowered spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, spider-like appearance and pale, almost translucent floral structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer, are notable for their unique shape and coloration.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
