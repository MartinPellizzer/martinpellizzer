<p>Calyptrogyne ghiesbreghtiana subsp.</p>
<p>glauca, commonly known as the coastal senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and is often found in coastal and saline environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are usually trifoliate. It has a fibrous root system that helps it tolerate saltwater and sandy soils.</p>
<p>The subspecies glauca is distinguished by its glaucous, waxy coating on the foliage, which provides protection against harsh coastal conditions.</p>
