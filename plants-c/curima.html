                    <h1>Curima</h1>
<p>Curima, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, seed-like structures. Curima is valued for its dense, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and carving.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
