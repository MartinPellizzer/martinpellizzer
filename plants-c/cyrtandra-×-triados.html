<p>Cyrtandra × triados, commonly known as the hybrid Cyrtandra, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Cyrtandra corymbosa and Cyrtandra pedata, two native Hawaiian species. The plant typically exhibits a combination of characteristics from both parent species, including leaf shape and flower color. It is often found in moist, shaded forest habitats on the islands of Hawaii.</p>
