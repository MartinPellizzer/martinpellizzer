                    <h1>Corallorhiza macrantha</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza macrantha, commonly known as the showy coralroot, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>This herbaceous plant lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on mycorrhizal fungi for its nutrients, making it a myco-heterotroph. It produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright orange to red flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and wasps. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with other orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
