<p>Campanula macrorhiza subsp.</p>
<p>gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, typically from June to August.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found on rocky or gypsum-rich substrates. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions.</p>
