                    <h1>Cedrela imparipinnata</h1>
<p>Cedrela imparipinnata, commonly known as the yellowheart tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are odd-pinnate and have a distinctive yellowish hue when mature. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its heartwood is highly valued for its durability and rich golden color, making it a sought-after timber species.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in many regions.</p>
