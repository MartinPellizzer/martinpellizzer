<p>Cyperus microbulbosus, commonly known as the dwarf bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that bloom in summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Cyperus microbulbosus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
