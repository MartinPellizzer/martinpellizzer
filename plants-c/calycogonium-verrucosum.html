                    <h1>Calycogonium verrucosum</h1>
<p>Calycogonium verrucosum, commonly known as the rough bladdergrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the warmer regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread aggressively through vegetative propagation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by the development of distinctive, inflated, bladder-like fruits. Its leaves are lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>The species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
