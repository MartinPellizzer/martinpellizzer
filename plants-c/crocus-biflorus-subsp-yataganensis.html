<p>Crocus biflorus subsp.</p>
<p>yataganensis, commonly known as the Yatagan crocus, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, corm-based growth habit and produces showy, saucer-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange.</p>
<p>The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge after the flowering period.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
