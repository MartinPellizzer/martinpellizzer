                            <h1>Codonoprasum Complanatum</h1>
<p>Flatleaf codonopsis, scientifically known as Codonoprasum complanatum, is a rare and intriguing plant native to the mountainous regions of China. This species belongs to the Campanulaceae family, which includes a variety of flowering plants known for their bell-shaped flowers. Despite its delicate appearance, Flatleaf codonopsis is remarkably resilient, thriving in harsh, high-altitude environments. Its flat, broad leaves and pale blue flowers make it a unique addition to botanical collections. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this plant is now classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
