                    <h1>Colchicum autumnale var. gibraltaricum</h1>
<p>Colchicum autumnale var. gibraltaricum, commonly known as the Gibraltar autumn crocus, is a rare and striking member of the Colchicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of North Africa, including Gibraltar, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces striking purple to violet flowers with a distinctive red or orange corona, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
