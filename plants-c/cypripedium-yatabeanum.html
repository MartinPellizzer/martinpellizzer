                    <h1>Cypripedium yatabeanum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium yatabeanum, commonly known as the Yatabe lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a unique feature among orchids. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its foliage consists of broad, leathery leaves that help it thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
