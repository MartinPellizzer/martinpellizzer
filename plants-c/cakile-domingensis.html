                    <h1>Cakile domingensis</h1>
<p>Cakile domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the rocky coastal areas of the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in sunny, coastal environments. Its small, white or pink flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, rounded seed pods that disperse its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cakile domingensis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
