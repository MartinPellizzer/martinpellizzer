                    <h1>Crepidium seleniglossum</h1>
<p>Crepidium seleniglossum, commonly known as the silver-tongued orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated flowers with a silvery-blue hue and a distinctive, almost tongue-like shape that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in its harsh, mountainous habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to minimize water loss in the cold, dry environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Crepidium seleniglossum is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
