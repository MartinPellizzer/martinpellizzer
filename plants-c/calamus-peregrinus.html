                    <h1>Calamus peregrinus</h1>
<p>Calamus peregrinus, commonly known as the wandering reed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish-white flowers. Calamus peregrinus is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its morphology and ecological role.</p>
