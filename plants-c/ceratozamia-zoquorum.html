                    <h1>Ceratozamia zoquorum</h1>
<p>Ceratozamia zoquorum, commonly known as the Zoque cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a thick, fibrous root system and a distinctive, spiky appearance. It produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common among cycads.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ceratozamia zoquorum is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical research.</p>
