                    <h1>Cuscuta planiflora var. algeriana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta planiflora var. algeriana, commonly known as the Algerian dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant is native to North Africa and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
