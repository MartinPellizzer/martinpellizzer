                    <h1>Crocus versicolor var. urbanus</h1>
<p>Crocus versicolor var. urbanus, commonly known as the urban crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking, often variegated flowers in shades of yellow, white, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, globe-shaped bulbs that help it spread vegetatively. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for urban gardens and rockeries.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to disturbed soils has led to its naturalization in urban environments.</p>
