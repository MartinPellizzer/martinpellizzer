<p>Cousinia ramosissima, commonly known as the many-branched cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in the spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Cousinia ramosissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens.</p>
