                    <h1>Chamaecyparis obtusa var. ericoides</h1>
<p>Chamaecyparis obtusa var. ericoides, commonly known as the Japanese false cypress or ericoid false cypress, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen conifer.</p>
<p>It features scale-like leaves that are closely pressed to the branches, giving it a dense, mat-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its neat form and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
