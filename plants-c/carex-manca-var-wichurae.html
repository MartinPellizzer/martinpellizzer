<p>Carex manca var. wichurae, commonly known as the Wichura's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and swampy areas. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or brown, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>The varietal form, wichurae, is distinguished by specific morphological traits that set it apart from the typical Carex manca.</p>
