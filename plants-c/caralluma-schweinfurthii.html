<p>Caralluma schweinfurthii, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Caralluma schweinfurthii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
