                    <h1>Cuscuta inodora</h1>
<p>Cuscuta inodora, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that begins with a seed germinating on the surface of a host plant. The plant develops a network of fine, thread-like stems that attach to the host's vascular system, extracting water and nutrients. It is found in various regions across North America and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host plants, affecting their growth and productivity.</p>
