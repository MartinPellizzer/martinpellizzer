                    <h1>Carpogymnia disjuncta</h1>
<p>Carpogymnia disjuncta, commonly known as the disjunct carpogymnia, is a rare and specialized lichen species belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which consists of a loosely branched, foliose growth with a distinct upper and lower cortex. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a specific strain of green algae, which contributes to its photosynthetic capabilities. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found on decaying wood in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
