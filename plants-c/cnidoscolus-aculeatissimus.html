                    <h1>Cnidoscolus aculeatissimus</h1>
<p>Cnidoscolus aculeatissimus, commonly known as the "arrow leaf" or "spiny begonia," is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and spiny margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, spiny fruits containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, its spines and toxic sap make it potentially hazardous to handle without care.</p>
