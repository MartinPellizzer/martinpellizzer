                    <h1>Coespeletia elongata</h1>
<p>Coespeletia elongata, commonly known as the elongated cholla, is a species of cactus native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in clusters of spines, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. Its adaptations to high-altitude environments include reduced leaf surfaces and efficient water storage in its stem.</p>
<p>Coespeletia elongata plays a role in its ecosystem by providing shelter and food for various desert animals.</p>
