                    <h1>Carex aquatilis subsp. epigejos</h1>
<p>Carex aquatilis subsp.</p>
<p>epigejos, commonly known as the floating sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, ribbon-shaped leaves that float just above the water surface.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in shallow water.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
