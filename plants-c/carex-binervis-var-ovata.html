<p>Carex binervis var. ovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist environments in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in consistently moist to saturated soil conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike of small, greenish-brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its broader, more ovate leaves compared to the typical form of Carex binervis.</p>
