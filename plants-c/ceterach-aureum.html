                <h1>Ceterach aureum</h1>
<p>Ceterach aureum, commonly known as golden corymbia, is a species of flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small, shrub-like plant with dense, leathery foliage that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Ceterach aureum is well adapted to coastal environments and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
