                    <h1>Cinnagrostis deserticola var. deserticola</h1>
<p>Cinnagrostis deserticola var. deserticola, commonly known as desert sandgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass with fine, thread-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in desert ecosystems.</p>
