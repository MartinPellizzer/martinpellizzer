                            <h1>Calathea Lutea</h1>
<p>Calathea lutea is a striking tropical plant known for its vibrant, patterned leaves that change color throughout the day. Native to the rainforests of South America, it thrives in humid, shady environments with high light levels. This unique species belongs to the Marantaceae family and is often referred to as the "prayer plant" due to its leaves' tendency to fold at night. Its ability to display a range of hues makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening enthusiasts. Proper care, including consistent moisture and indirect sunlight, is essential to maintain its health and beauty.</p>
