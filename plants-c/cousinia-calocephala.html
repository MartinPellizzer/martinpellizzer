                    <h1>Cousinia calocephala</h1>
<p>Cousinia calocephala, commonly known as the woolly cushion flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of silver-gray, woolly foliage that helps it conserve moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Cousinia calocephala is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
