<p>Coeloglossum viride f. microbracteatum, commonly known as the small-bract green hawksbeard, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure, featuring small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, scale-like bracts that distinguish it from other members of the genus. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
