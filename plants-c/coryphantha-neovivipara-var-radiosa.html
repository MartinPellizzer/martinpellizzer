                    <h1>Coryphantha neovivipara var. radiosa</h1>
<p>Coryphantha neovivipara var. radiosa, commonly known as the Radiate Livebearers, is a unique cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that often branch into a spherical shape, covered in dense, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. It is a viviparous species, meaning it gives birth to live pups rather than producing seeds, which is a rare trait among cacti.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species, requiring careful conservation efforts.</p>
