<p>Critesion brevisubulatum subsp.</p>
<p>turkestanicum, commonly known as the Turkestan narrow-leaved cactus, is a low-growing succulent native to Central Asia. It features short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in regions with limited rainfall.</p>
