                    <h1>Crataegus benearnensis</h1>
<p>Crataegus benearnensis, commonly known as the Benearn hawthorn, is a rare shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red berries that are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Botanists study it to better understand its ecological role and conservation needs in its native environment.</p>
