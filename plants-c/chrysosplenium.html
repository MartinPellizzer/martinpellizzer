They are characterized by their delicate, often hairy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that may be green or yellow in color. Chrysosplenium species are often found in rocky or woodland habitats, where they contribute to the understory vegetation.</p>
<p>Their botanical features make them interesting subjects for study in both ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>
