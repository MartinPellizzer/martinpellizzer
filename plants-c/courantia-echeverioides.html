<p>Courantia echeverioides, commonly known as the silver echeveria, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple during the spring or summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
