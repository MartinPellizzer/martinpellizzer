                    <h1>Castilleja fissifolia var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Castilleja fissifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks true leaves, relying on its haustoria to extract water and nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in open, dry habitats like grasslands and sagebrush steppe.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
