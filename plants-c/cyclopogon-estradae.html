                    <h1>Cyclopogon estradae</h1>
<p>Cyclopogon estradae, commonly known as the Estrada's cyclopogon, is a rare bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with vibrant red bracts that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
