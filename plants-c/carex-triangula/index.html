                            <h1>Carex Triangula</h1>
<p>Carex triangula is a unique species of sedge known for its distinctive triangular stems and compact growth habit. Native to temperate regions, this plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. Its narrow leaves and clustered flower heads make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Despite its modest appearance, Carex triangula plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and improving soil stability. With its adaptability and low maintenance requirements, it is a valuable addition to both natural and cultivated environments.</p>
