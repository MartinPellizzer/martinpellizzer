                    <h1>Ctenopteris lanigera</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris lanigera, commonly known as the hairy sea palm, is a species of fern belonging to the family Ctenopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, bushy fronds that are covered in soft, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant is typically found growing in intertidal zones, where it tolerates periodic submersion in saltwater. Its rhizomes form a compact, cushion-like structure that helps anchor it in sandy or muddy substrates.</p>
<p>Ctenopteris lanigera plays a role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
