                    <h1>Cassytha filiformis</h1>
<p>Cassytha filiformis, commonly known as the slender cassytha, is a parasitic flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its thin, vine-like stems that lack true roots. The plant attaches itself to host plants using specialized structures called haustoria, which extract nutrients from the host. It produces small, greenish-white flowers and is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host plants.</p>
