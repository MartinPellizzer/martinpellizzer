<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in brackish or saline wetlands, particularly in coastal areas. The plant is characterized by its prop roots, which help it anchor in waterlogged soil and facilitate gas exchange. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in dense inflorescences, and it produces woody capsules as fruit.</p>
<p>Ceriops pauciflora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
