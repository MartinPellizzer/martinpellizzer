<p>Cyclotaxis turgida, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically spirally arranged around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance reminiscent of a waterwheel. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. It is notable for its ability to trap air bubbles, which aid in buoyancy and gas exchange.</p>
<p>Cyclotaxis turgida plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
