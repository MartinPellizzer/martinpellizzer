                    <h1>Caulanthus lasiophyllus var. rigidus</h1>
<p>Caulanthus lasiophyllus var. rigidus, commonly known as the rigid leaf silversword, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in late spring, typically arranged in a compact, terminal cluster. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, often growing in coastal scrub and dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
