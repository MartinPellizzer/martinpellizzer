                    <h1>Coffea oleifolia</h1>
<p>Coffea oleifolia, commonly known as the oil bean or wild coffee, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa, the Caribbean, and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, which is used for oil extraction rather than for coffee production. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique properties, it has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural oil.</p>
