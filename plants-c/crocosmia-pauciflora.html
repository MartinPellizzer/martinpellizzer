<p>Crocosmia pauciflora, commonly known as the slender flame or narrowleaf gladiolus, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features strap-like, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and upright, forming a dense clump. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of striking orange-red to yellow flowers, which are often tubular in shape. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is valued both for ornamental purposes and in horticultural collections.</p>
