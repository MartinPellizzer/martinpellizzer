                <h1>Chloris villosa</h1>
<p>Chloris villosa, commonly known as hairy grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
