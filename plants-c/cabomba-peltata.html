                    <h1>Cabomba peltata</h1>
<p>Cabomba peltata, commonly known as the waterweed or fragrant waterweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feather-like leaves that are often mistaken for those of water lilies. The plant produces small, white flowers that float on the water surface, which are pollinated by insects. Its rhizomes form dense underwater mats, contributing to water clarity by reducing algal growth.</p>
<p>Cabomba peltata is popular in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
