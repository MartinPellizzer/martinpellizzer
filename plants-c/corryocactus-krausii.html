                    <h1>Corryocactus krausii</h1>
<p>Corryocactus krausii, commonly known as the Kraus's corryocactus, is a rare and unique cactus native to a very limited geographic area in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and is typically found in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers during the warmer months, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a threatened species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and conservation efforts.</p>
