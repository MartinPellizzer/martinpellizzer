<p>Cousinia sicigera, commonly known as the Sicilian cushion plant, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of gray-green, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Cousinia sicigera is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand drought conditions.</p>
