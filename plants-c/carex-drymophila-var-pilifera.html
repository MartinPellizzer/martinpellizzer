                    <h1>Carex drymophila var. pilifera</h1>
<p>Carex drymophila var. pilifera, commonly known as the silky sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects.</p>
