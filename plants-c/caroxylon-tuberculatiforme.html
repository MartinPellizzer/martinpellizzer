                    <h1>Caroxylon tuberculatiforme</h1>
<p>Caroxylon tuberculatiforme, commonly known as the tuberculate caroxylon, is a rare and ancient plant species characterized by its unique tuberculate (bumpy) stem structure.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Alismataceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit with slender, segmented stems that often form dense mats. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Caroxylon tuberculatiforme is considered a conservation concern.</p>
