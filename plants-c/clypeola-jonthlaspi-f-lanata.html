                    <h1>Clypeola jonthlaspi f. lanata</h1>
<p>Clypeola jonthlaspi f. lanata, commonly known as the hairy clypeola, is a variant of the species Clypeola jonthlaspi, characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage.</p>
<p>This plant belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important flowering plants. It is typically found in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The hairy texture of its leaves is an adaptation that helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in racemes, adding to its botanical interest.</p>
