<p>Ctenopteris taxodioides, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as rivers and lakes. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, broad, and often lobed shape.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
