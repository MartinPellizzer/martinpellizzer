<p>Calanthe discolor var. kanashiroi, commonly known as the Kanashiro's calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a white or pale pink coloration with contrasting purple or violet markings. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments. It is often found in forest understories where it benefits from dappled sunlight and rich, well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
