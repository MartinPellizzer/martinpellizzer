                    <h1>Cactus cephalophorus</h1>
<p>Cactus cephalophorus, commonly known as the golden crown cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its roots are shallow and widespread, enabling it to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently.</p>
<p>The cactus also has spines that provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through evaporation.</p>
