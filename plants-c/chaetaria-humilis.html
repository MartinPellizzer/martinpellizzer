                    <h1>Chaetaria humilis</h1>
<p>Chaetaria humilis, commonly known as the dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
