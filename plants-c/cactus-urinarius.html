                    <h1>Cactus urinarius</h1>
<p>Cactus urinarius, commonly known as the urine cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to absorb rainwater efficiently in its dry environment. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Despite its unusual name, it plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various desert animals.</p>
