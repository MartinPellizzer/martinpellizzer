                    <h1>Cristaria setosa</h1>
<p>Cristaria setosa, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, which help in capturing prey. The plant is a carnivorous species, using its specialized bladder-like structures to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
