                    <h1>Cactus radiosus var. chloranthus</h1>
<p>Cactus radiosus var. chloranthus, commonly known as the green-flowered cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green, with spines that provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning, often in clusters along the stem. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and adapting to harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and resilience in low-water environments.</p>
