                    <h1>Cinna arundinacea var. inexpansa</h1>
<p>[WRONG START] Cinna arundinacea var. inexpensa, commonly known as the giant reed, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like formations. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it a common weed in wetlands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
