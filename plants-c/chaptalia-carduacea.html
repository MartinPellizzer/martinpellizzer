<p>Chaptalia carduacea, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with low moisture availability.</p>
<p>Chaptalia carduacea plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat.</p>
