                    <h1>Coleus scutellarioides var. laciniatus</h1>
<p>Coleus scutellarioides var. laciniatus, commonly known as the laceleaf coleus, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely cut, lobed leaves that give it a feathery appearance, often in shades of green, red, and purple. The plant belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is known for its vibrant foliage rather than its small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular in gardens and as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care.</p>
