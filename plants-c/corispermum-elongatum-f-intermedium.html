<p>Corispermum elongatum f. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate elongated corisperm, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Chenopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline or alkaline environments, often found in coastal areas or salt marshes. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are succulent, adapted to conserve water. It has a short lifespan, completing its reproductive cycle within a single growing season.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its morphological variation between its parent species, showing intermediate traits in stem length and leaf shape.</p>
