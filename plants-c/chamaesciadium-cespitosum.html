                    <h1>Chamaesciadium cespitosum</h1>
<p>Chamaesciadium cespitosum, commonly known as mountain mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of tiny, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers in early spring, which are typically clustered at the base of the leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate harsh conditions, it is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny areas.</p>
