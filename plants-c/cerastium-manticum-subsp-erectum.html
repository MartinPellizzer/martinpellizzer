<p>Cerastium manticum subsp.</p>
<p>erectum, commonly known as the upright mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features small, pale green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces tiny white or pinkish flowers in the spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowering stems are usually erect, hence the subspecies name "erectum.".</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion.</p>
