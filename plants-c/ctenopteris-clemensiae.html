                    <h1>Ctenopteris clemensiae</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris clemensiae, commonly known as the Bornean water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into numerous narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense tropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
