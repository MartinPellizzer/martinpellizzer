                    <h1>Cacara orbicularis</h1>
<p>Cacara orbicularis, commonly known as the globe cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, adding a burst of color to its otherwise desolate environment. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Cacara orbicularis is a slow-growing plant, often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
