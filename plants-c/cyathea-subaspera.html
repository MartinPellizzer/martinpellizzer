                    <h1>Cyathea subaspera</h1>
<p>Cyathea subaspera, commonly known as the rough tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately divided fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing cones, called sorangs, are located at the base of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Cyathea subaspera is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can grow up to several meters in height.</p>
