                    <h1>Cheilanthes lemmonii</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes lemmonii, commonly known as the Lemmon's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rock surfaces, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with thick, leathery fronds that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>This resilient fern is often found in rocky habitats across the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
