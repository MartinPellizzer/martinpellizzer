                    <h1>Cyanococcus angustifolius var. laevifolius</h1>
<p>Cyanococcus angustifolius var. laevifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are narrow and have a smooth, waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This plant is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in full sun.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
