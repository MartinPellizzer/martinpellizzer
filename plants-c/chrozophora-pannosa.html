<p>Chrozophora pannosa, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has hairy, grayish-green leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in the spring and are followed by small, bead-like fruits.</p>
<p>Chrozophora pannosa is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, desert-like conditions.</p>
