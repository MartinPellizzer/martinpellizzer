                    <h1>Cuscuta gamostyla</h1>
<p>Cuscuta gamostyla, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinct appearance with its thread-like, yellow stems that twine around its host. The plant is widespread in temperate regions and can infest a variety of crops and wild plants. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, animals, or through contaminated agricultural machinery.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural yields if left unchecked.</p>
