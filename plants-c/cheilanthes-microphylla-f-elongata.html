                    <h1>Cheilanthes microphylla f. elongata</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes microphylla f. elongata, commonly known as the elongated rock fern, is a variant of the rockcap fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white to pale green hairs. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperature fluctuations. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called soruses on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in distinctive, kidney-shaped patterns.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in crevices and on exposed rock faces, where it forms dense, resilient colonies.</p>
