                    <h1>Cenostigma eriostachys</h1>
<p>Cenostigma eriostachys, commonly known as the hairy leaf cenostigma, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central America and northern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fibrous roots make it well adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Cenostigma eriostachys is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
