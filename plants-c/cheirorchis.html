                    <h1>Cheirorchis</h1>
<p>Cheirorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the cloud forests of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil, Peru, and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its unique, elongated green leaves and its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Cheirorchis lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to deforestation, it is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs.</p>
