                    <h1>Conium moschatum</h1>
<p>Conium moschatum, commonly known as hemlock, is a toxic herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, hollow stems that are often mistaken for bamboo, and its leaves are finely divided, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It is particularly dangerous due to the presence of poisonings, such as coniine, which can be lethal even in small doses.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it has been historically used in medicine and as a poison.</p>
