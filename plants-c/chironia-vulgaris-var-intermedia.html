                    <h1>Chironia vulgaris var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Chironia vulgaris var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate marsh thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces large, showy purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and prominent veins, and are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its intermediate characteristics between the typical var. vulgaris and var. alpina, showing a blend of morphological traits.</p>
