<p>Campyloneurum oligophlebium, commonly known as the narrow-veined wall-rue, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant exhibits a thalloid structure, with a flattened, ribbon-like body that is often covered in a layer of fine, waxy secretions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocks or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, develop from specialized leaves called sporophylls, which produce spores for propagation.</p>
