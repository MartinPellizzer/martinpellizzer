                    <h1>Cactus nudus</h1>
<p>Cactus nudus, commonly known as the naked cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of spines, which distinguishes it from many other cactus species. The plant has a cylindrical stem that is covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
