The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by elongated, three-lobed pods containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
