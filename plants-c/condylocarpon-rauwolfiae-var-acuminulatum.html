                    <h1>Condylocarpon rauwolfiae var. acuminulatum</h1>
<p>Condylocarpon rauwolfiae var. acuminulatum, commonly known as the acuminulate lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a pale to dark green thallus with a distinct, leathery texture and a central, lobed structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide photosynthetic energy, while the fungal component offers structural support and protection. It typically grows on bark, soil, or rock surfaces, preferring shaded and moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological sensitivity, it is often used as an indicator of air quality and environmental health.</p>
