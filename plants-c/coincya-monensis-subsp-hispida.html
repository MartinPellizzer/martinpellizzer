<p>Coincya monensis subsp.</p>
<p>hispida, commonly known as the hairy water starwort, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinct appearance.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are usually submerged, though some may emerge slightly at the water's surface.</p>
<p>It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through oxygen production.</p>
