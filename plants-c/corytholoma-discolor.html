                    <h1>Corytholoma discolor</h1>
<p>Corytholoma discolor, commonly known as the yellow stinkhorn, is a unique fungal plant that belongs to the Phallaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow, gelatinous cap that emits a strong, unpleasant odor to attract insects for spore dispersal. The fungus typically grows on decaying wood, especially in moist, shaded environments. Its life cycle involves the formation of a slimy, egg-like structure that develops into the mature fruiting body.</p>
<p>Despite its unattractive appearance, it plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems.</p>
