                    <h1>Cissus coriacea</h1>
<p>Cissus coriacea, commonly known as the bone plant or rock fig, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible, fig-like fruits. Its stems are woody and can grow along the ground or climb over rocks and other surfaces.</p>
<p>Cissus coriacea is well adapted to rocky and dry habitats, making it a resilient and hardy species.</p>
