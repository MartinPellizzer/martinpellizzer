                            <h1>Conostegia Calocoma</h1>
<p>California flame tree, scientifically known as Conostegia calocoma, is a strikingly beautiful and fast-growing tree native to the coastal regions of southern California. With its vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring, it adds a dramatic splash of color to the landscape. This tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal climates with well-drained soil. Despite its beauty, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native plants. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a popular choice for landscaping and a subject of ecological concern.</p>
