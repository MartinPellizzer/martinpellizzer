                    <h1>Corrigiola squamosa</h1>
<p>Corrigiola squamosa, commonly known as sand rocket, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arid and coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its succulent stems and leaves store water, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Corrigiola squamosa is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
