                            <h1>Cyclobalanopsis Hui</h1>
<p>Cyclobalanopsis hui is a rare and ancient tree species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. This species is known for its distinctive broad leaves and robust, hardy wood that has been used historically in construction and crafts. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is now classified as endangered. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and preserve this unique plant for future generations.</p>
