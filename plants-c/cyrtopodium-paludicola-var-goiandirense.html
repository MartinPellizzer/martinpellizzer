                    <h1>Cyrtopodium paludicola var. goiandirense</h1>
<p>Cyrtopodium paludicola var. goiandirense, commonly known as the Goiandirenses marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and it has narrow, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, this variety is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
