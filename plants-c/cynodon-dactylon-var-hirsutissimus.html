                    <h1>Cynodon dactylon var. hirsutissimus</h1>
<p>Cynodon dactylon var. hirsutissimus, commonly known as hairy Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to warm climates.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture, giving it its common name. It is often used for lawns, erosion control, and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and rapid growth.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to spread aggressively, making it both useful and potentially invasive.</p>
