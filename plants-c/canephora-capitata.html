<p>Canephora capitata, commonly known as the wild coffee plant, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces red, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed, which is the source of its caffeine content. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to cultivated coffee species, it is of interest in botanical and agricultural research.</p>
