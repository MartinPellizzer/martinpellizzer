                    <h1>Cypripedium insigne var. nilsonii</h1>
<p>Cypripedium insigne var. nilsonii, commonly known as the Nilson's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or white with a contrasting veined pattern. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with a short rhizome and a single, fleshy leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of soft, white pubescence. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is highly valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological significance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
