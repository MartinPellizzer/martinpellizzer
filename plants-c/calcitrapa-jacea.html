<p>Calcitrapa jacea, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with fleshy, succulent stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Calcitrapa jacea is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
