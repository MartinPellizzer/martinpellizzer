                    <h1>Cyperus longus var. incompertus</h1>
<p>Cyperus longus var. incompertus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to wetland and marshy habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale blue to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its persistence in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
