                    <h1>Chionachne sclerachne</h1>
<p>Chionachne sclerachne, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it withstand harsh cold climates. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize rocky or barren ground.</p>
<p>Chionachne sclerachne plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife.</p>
