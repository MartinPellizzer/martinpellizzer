                <h1>Commicarpus tuberosus</h1>
<p>Commicarpus tuberosus, commonly known as the tuberous commicarpus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, tuberous roots that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The species is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens.</p>
