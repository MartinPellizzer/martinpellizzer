                    <h1>Cecropia pinnatiloba</h1>
<p>Cecropia pinnatiloba, commonly known as the giant water fig, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with Aztec ants, which protect it from herbivores in exchange for shelter and nectar. Its rapid growth rate makes it useful for erosion control and reforestation efforts.</p>
<p>The tree also produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, fig-like fruits containing seeds.</p>
