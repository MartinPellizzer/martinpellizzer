                    <h1>Carex verna f. glomerata</h1>
<p>Carex verna f. glomerata, commonly known as the clustered spring sedge, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 cm and thrives in rich, well-drained soil. It is often found in woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and ability to form dense ground cover, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens.</p>
