                    <h1>Cyathea hallieri</h1>
<p>Cyathea hallieri, commonly known as the Hall's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, with a rootstock that produces new shoots from the base. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft blue glow at night, which is a rare trait among ferns.</p>
<p>Cyathea hallieri thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
