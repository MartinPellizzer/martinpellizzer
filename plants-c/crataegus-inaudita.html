<p>Crataegus inaudita, commonly known as the silent hawthorn, is a rare and little-studied species of hawthorn native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white flowers and red berries that appear in the autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, preferring well-drained soils and temperate climates. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the bark is smooth and grayish in color.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Crataegus inaudita is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
