                    <h1>Clidemia phaeostaphis</h1>
<p>Clidemia phaeostaphis, commonly known as the white-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host trees through its haustelia, drawing water and nutrients from the host. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant stress to its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
