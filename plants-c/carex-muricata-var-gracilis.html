                    <h1>Carex muricata var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Carex muricata var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is native to wetlands and moist soils in temperate regions, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an effective wetland stabilizer.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and support diverse wildlife.</p>
