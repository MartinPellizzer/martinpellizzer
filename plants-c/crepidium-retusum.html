<p>Crepidium retusum, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in a spike. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>The orchid's reproductive strategy relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for successful seed germination.</p>
