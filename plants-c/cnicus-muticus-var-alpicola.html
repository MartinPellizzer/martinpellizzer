                    <h1>Cnicus muticus var. alpicola</h1>
<p>Cnicus muticus var. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in alpine regions.</p>
