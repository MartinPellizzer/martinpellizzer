                    <h1>Clethra chiapensis</h1>
<p>Clethra chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas clethra, is a shrub native to Central America, particularly found in the humid forests of Mexico and Guatemala.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its showy blooms and compact growth habit, though it is less commonly cultivated than other clethra species.</p>
