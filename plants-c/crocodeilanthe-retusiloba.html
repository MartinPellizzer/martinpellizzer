<p>Crocodeilanthe retusiloba, commonly known as the broad-leafed staghorn fern, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and typically attaches itself to trees or rocky surfaces. Its unique morphology includes a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in conservation programs aimed at preserving tropical biodiversity.</p>
