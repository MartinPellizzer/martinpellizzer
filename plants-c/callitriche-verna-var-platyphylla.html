<p>Callitriche verna var. platyphylla, commonly known as broadleaf water-starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, often near the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has opposite, broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a smooth surface and a waxy coating. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, appearing in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water clarity through its dense growth.</p>
