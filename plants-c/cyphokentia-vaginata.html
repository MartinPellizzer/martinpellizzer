                    <h1>Cyphokentia vaginata</h1>
<p>Cyphokentia vaginata, commonly known as the bottle palm, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk that resembles a bottle, hence its common name. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyphokentia vaginata is typically found in lowland rainforests and is adapted to humid, warm climates.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes.</p>
