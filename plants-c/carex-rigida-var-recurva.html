                    <h1>Carex rigida var. recurva</h1>
<p>Carex rigida var. recurva, commonly known as the recurved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curled at the tips, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires consistent moisture, making it a valuable addition to wetland restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in aquatic environments.</p>
