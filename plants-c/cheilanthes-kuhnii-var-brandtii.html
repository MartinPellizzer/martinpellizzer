<p>Cheilanthes kuhnii var. brandtii, commonly known as the Brandt's rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and rocky habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and can tolerate periods of drought, making it well-suited to harsh environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and geographic distribution compared to other members of the Cheilanthes genus.</p>
