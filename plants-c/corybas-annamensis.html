                    <h1>Corybas annamensis</h1>
<p>Corybas annamensis, commonly known as the Annam ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the orchid family native to the mountainous regions of Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, hooded flower that resembles a ghostly face, with a deep purple to black coloration. The plant is epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks, and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its small, leathery leaves are adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
