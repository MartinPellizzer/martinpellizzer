                            <h1>Capsella Segetum</h1>
<p>Capsella segetum, also known as the field pepper or wild pepper, is a small flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found along roadsides and in fields. Despite its modest size, it plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. The plant is often mistaken for a weed due to its rapid growth and widespread presence. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
