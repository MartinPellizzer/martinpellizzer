<p>Campanula patula var. costae, commonly known as the Woolly Bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright stems covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and also covered with a fine layer of soft, white hairs.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a drought-tolerant ground cover.</p>
