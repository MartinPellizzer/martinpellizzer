                    <h1>Crossoglossa tipuloides</h1>
<p>Crossoglossa tipuloides, commonly known as the narrow-winged gall midge, is a small fly belonging to the family Tipulidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated body and narrow wings, which are often transparent or lightly colored. The plant-associated life cycle of this species involves the formation of galls on the leaves of certain plants, primarily in the genus *Cotula*. These galls provide shelter and nutrients for the developing larvae.</p>
<p>While not a plant itself, Crossoglossa tipuloides plays a role in the ecological interactions of its host plants.</p>
