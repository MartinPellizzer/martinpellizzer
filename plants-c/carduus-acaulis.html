                    <h1>Carduus acaulis</h1>
<p>Carduus acaulis, commonly known as the mouse-eared chickweed, is a perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with woolly, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. Its scientific name reflects its lack of a stem (acaulis) and its association with the genus Carduus, which includes many thistle-like species.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
