<p>Crepis oreadis, commonly known as the mountain mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky and gravelly soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The small, yellowish flowers appear in late summer, producing seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
