<p>Cycas bglswamyi, commonly known as the Bglswamyi cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature known as dioecy. Cycas bglswamyi is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
