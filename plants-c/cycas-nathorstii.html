                    <h1>Cycas nathorstii</h1>
<p>Cycas nathorstii, commonly known as the Nathorst's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that resemble those of a fern. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo, this cycad is adapted to humid, warm climates. Its reproductive structures include large, cone-like strobili, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat loss, Cycas nathorstii is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical research.</p>
