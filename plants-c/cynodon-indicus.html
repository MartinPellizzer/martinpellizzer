<p>Cynodon indicus, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense growth habit, making it highly resilient to drought and heat. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions and withstand grazing. It is widely used for turfgrass in warm climates due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays an important ecological role in preventing soil erosion and supporting local wildlife.</p>
