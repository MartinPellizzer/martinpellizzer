                    <h1>Carex atrata var. spadicea</h1>
<p>Carex atrata var. spadicea, commonly known as the black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many sedges. Its dark green foliage and ability to thrive in saturated soils make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments.</p>
