                    <h1>Chaetostoma pungens</h1>
<p>Chaetostoma pungens, commonly known as the spiny pleco, is a freshwater fish native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Loricariidae family and is characterized by its armored body and distinctive spines. The plant in question is not applicable, as Chaetostoma pungens is a fish, not a plant. Therefore, I cannot provide botanical aspects for this species.</p>
<p>I can't reply.</p>
