<p>Carex praetutiana, commonly known as the Alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in alpine and subalpine environments. It produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers in the summer, which are followed by dark, edible berries.</p>
<p>Carex praetutiana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
