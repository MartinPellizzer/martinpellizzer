                    <h1>Cyclosorus longqishanensis</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus longqishanensis, commonly known as the Longqishan cyclosorus, is a rare fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an important species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
