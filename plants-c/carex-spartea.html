<p>Carex spartea, commonly known as narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. Native to wetland and moist habitats in North America, it thrives in poorly drained soils. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Carex spartea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife.</p>
