<p>Castilleja breweri, commonly known as the Brewster's paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its roots. The plant produces showy, red-orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and often obscured by the dense inflorescence.</p>
<p>Castilleja breweri thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments.</p>
