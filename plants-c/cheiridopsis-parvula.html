                    <h1>Cheiridopsis parvula</h1>
<p>Cheiridopsis parvula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ice plant, is a small, succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, cylindrical leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically during the winter months. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it requires minimal care once established.</p>
