<p>Carex socialis, commonly known as the social sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color.
