<p>Cystopteris tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that often grow in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant has a rhizome that is submerged, supporting the development of its finely divided, pinnate leaves. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cystopteris tibetica is native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
