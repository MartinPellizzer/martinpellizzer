                    <h1>Calanthe poilanei</h1>
<p>Calanthe poilanei, commonly known as the Poilane's calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and its clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on the forest floor. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Calanthe poilanei is considered a valuable species in botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
