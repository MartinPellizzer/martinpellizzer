                    <h1>Carex hystericina var. angustior</h1>
<p>Carex hystericina var. angustior, commonly known as narrowleaf marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and dark green, with a waxy coating that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in a cylindrical inflorescence. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Carex hystericina.</p>
