                    <h1>Cypripedium fasciculatum var. pusillum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium fasciculatum var. pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf lady's slipper, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is used to trap pollinators. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest floors, often among mosses and ferns. Its leaves are oval and革质 (leathery), and it produces a single flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
