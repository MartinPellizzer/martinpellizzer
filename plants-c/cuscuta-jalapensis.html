                    <h1>Cuscuta jalapensis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta jalapensis, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth rate, often smothering its host. The plant's roots are specialized for attachment to host stems, and it can thrive on a variety of plants, including crops and ornamentals. Its life cycle involves producing seeds that can remain viable in the soil for years.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a weed in many agricultural settings.</p>
