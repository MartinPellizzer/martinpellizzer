                    <h1>Calyptrochilum imbricatum</h1>
<p>Calyptrochilum imbricatum, commonly known as the imbricate lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to the wet tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a distinctive, imbricated (overlapping) lip that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>The orchid's floral structure is complex, featuring a spurred lip and a column, which are typical features of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
