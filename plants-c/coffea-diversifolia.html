                    <h1>Coffea diversifolia</h1>
<p>Coffea diversifolia, commonly known as the variable coffee plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its elliptical to ovate leaves, which are often pubescent and have a distinct venation pattern. It produces small, white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds used for coffee production.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated for commercial coffee due to its lower yield and specific growing requirements.</p>
