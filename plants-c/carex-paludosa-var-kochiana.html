                    <h1>Carex paludosa var. kochiana</h1>
<p>Carex paludosa var. kochiana, commonly known as the bog sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshy areas, along lake margins, and in other moist habitats, where it thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. The plant has grass-like leaves that are generally narrow and tapering, with a prominent midrib. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike that bears small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity.</p>
