                    <h1>Cercocoma macrantha</h1>
<p>Cercocoma macrantha, commonly known as the large-seeded desert fig, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fleshy, orange to red fruits that are edible and have a sweet, fig-like taste. Its fruit is an important food source for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Cercocoma macrantha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
