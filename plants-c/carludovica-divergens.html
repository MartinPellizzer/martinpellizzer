<p>Carludovica divergens, commonly known as the Mexican devil's backbone, is a rare and striking plant native to the highlands of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its unique, spiny, branched stems that resemble a skeletal structure. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by red, fleshy berries. Carludovica divergens is adapted to arid and rocky environments, often growing in limestone soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
