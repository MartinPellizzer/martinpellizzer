                    <h1>Colymbada scyria</h1>
<p>Colymbada scyria, commonly known as the common marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The species is also notable for its ability to tolerate seasonal flooding, making it an important indicator plant for wetland ecosystems.</p>
