<p>Cirsium pseudopalustre, commonly known as the swamp thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, woolly leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spherical shape at the top of the stem. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it plays a key role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity.</p>
