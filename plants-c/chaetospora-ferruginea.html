                    <h1>Chaetospora ferruginea</h1>
<p>Chaetospora ferruginea, commonly known as the rust lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, orange to reddish-brown thallus that often forms crust-like growths on tree bark and rock surfaces. The plant exhibits a complex symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. It is typically found in temperate and subtropical regions, often on shaded, moist substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for air quality and ecological health.</p>
