                    <h1>Colocynthis amarissima</h1>
<p>Colocynthis amarissima, commonly known as the bitter apple or wild cucumber, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers, pumpkins, and gourds. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers followed by spiny, orange-yellow fruits that mature in the autumn. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are woody and branched.</p>
<p>The fruit contains a toxic, bitter pulp and seeds, making it unsuitable for human consumption but valuable in traditional medicine.</p>
