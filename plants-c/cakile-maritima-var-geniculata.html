                    <h1>Cakile maritima var. geniculata</h1>
<p>Cakile maritima var. geniculata, commonly known as the coastal bladderwrack, is a variant of the bladderwrack species native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in saline and often wind-swept environments. The plant exhibits a succulent, leafy structure with a distinctive bladdery appearance due to its specialized air chambers. It typically grows in intertidal zones, where it withstands tidal fluctuations and high salinity.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to coastal conditions, making it an important component of maritime ecosystems.</p>
