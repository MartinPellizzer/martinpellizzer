                    <h1>Conocarpus sericeus</h1>
<p>Conocarpus sericeus, commonly known as the silky mangrove, is a halophytic tree native to the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fibrous, corky bark and dark green,革质 (leathery) leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing numerous seeds. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Conocarpus sericeus is adapted to thrive in intertidal zones, where it tolerates periodic submersion and high salinity.</p>
