<p>It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, aiding in moisture retention in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows, alpine tundra, and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its compact form and ability to tolerate cold climates, it is a hardy species adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
