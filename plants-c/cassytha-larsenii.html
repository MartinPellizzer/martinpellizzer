                    <h1>Cassytha larsenii</h1>
<p>Cassytha larsenii, commonly known as the creeping cassytha, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its slender, vine-like stems that often grow along the ground or through other vegetation. The plant lacks true leaves but has small, scale-like structures that perform photosynthesis. It produces small, white or greenish flowers and relies on host plants for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite.</p>
<p>Its unique growth habit and ecological role make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
