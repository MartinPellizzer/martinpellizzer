<p>Calomeria ozothamnoides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by a cluster of small, oval seeds enclosed in a pappus-like structure. It has adapted to drought conditions through its succulent leaves and deep root system.</p>
<p>Calomeria ozothamnoides is often found in rocky soils and is considered a characteristic species of desert scrub ecosystems.</p>
