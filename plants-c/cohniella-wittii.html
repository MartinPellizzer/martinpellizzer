<p>Cohniella wittii, commonly known as the Witt's coccoid fungus, is a unique organism that exhibits characteristics of both fungi and algae.</p>
<p>It is a unicellular, photosynthetic protist that belongs to the order Trentepohliales. This organism is often found in moist environments such as soil, water, and on plant surfaces. Its ability to perform photosynthesis allows it to thrive in low-nutrient conditions.</p>
<p>Cohniella wittii plays a role in nutrient cycling and can sometimes form dense mats that influence local microecology.</p>
