                    <h1>Chrysalidocarpus lanceolatus</h1>
<p>Chrysalidocarpus lanceolatus, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tall, evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach lengths of up to 5 meters. The plant produces large, fibrous fruits called coconuts, which contain both water and a white, fleshy interior. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize coastal areas, making it important for erosion control.</p>
<p>The coconut palm is also valued for its economic and cultural significance in many tropical countries.</p>
