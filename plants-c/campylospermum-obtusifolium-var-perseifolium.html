                    <h1>Campylospermum obtusifolium var. perseifolium</h1>
<p>Campylospermum obtusifolium var. perseifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved campylospermum, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, succulent stems and broad, fleshy leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne in the axils of the leaves. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping.</p>
