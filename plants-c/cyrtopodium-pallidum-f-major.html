<p>Cyrtopodium pallidum f. major, commonly known as the large-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, strap-like leaves and large, showy white or pale pink flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows on tree branches, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain rather than soil. Its delicate structure and unique appearance make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in its native range.</p>
