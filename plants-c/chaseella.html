<p>Chaseella, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaryllidaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their tall, erect stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, yellow, or orange. Chaseella species are typically perennial, with some varieties capable of surviving extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>These plants play an important ecological role in desert ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small animals.</p>
