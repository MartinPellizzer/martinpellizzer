                    <h1>Celtis pacifica var. subglabra</h1>
<p>Celtis pacifica var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, often glabrous bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are a food source for various birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished from other Celtis species by its reduced pubescence and specific geographic distribution.</p>
