                    <h1>Colobanthus apetalus var. alpinus</h1>
<p>Colobanthus apetalus var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to high-altitude regions of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, such as alpine tundras and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures are adapted to wind pollination, typical of many arctic and alpine species.</p>
<p>The species exhibits a high degree of morphological variation depending on its specific habitat and climatic conditions.</p>
