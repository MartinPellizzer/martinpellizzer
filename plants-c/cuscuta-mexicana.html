                    <h1>Cuscuta mexicana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to the Americas and is often found growing on crops such as corn and beans. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
