                    <h1>Ctenium minus</h1>
<p>Ctenium minus, commonly known as lesser ctenium, is a low-growing annual herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dry, disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
