<p>Cynanchum graphistemmatoides, commonly known as the hairy milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are also hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, is a distinguishing feature of the genus Cynanchum.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist woodlands and along stream banks, preferring partial to full shade.</p>
