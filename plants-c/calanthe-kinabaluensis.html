                    <h1>Calanthe kinabaluensis</h1>
<p>Calanthe kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu calanthe, is a rare and endemic orchid found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and intricate, fragrant floral structure. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically growing on rocky substrates or among moss-covered trees. Its flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring, are usually pale green to white with a distinct central lip.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Calanthe kinabaluensis is considered a conservation priority.</p>
