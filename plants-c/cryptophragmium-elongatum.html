                    <h1>Cryptophragmium elongatum</h1>
<p>Cryptophragmium elongatum, commonly known as the elongated cryptophragmium, is a rare and unique species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and intricate thalloid structure, which consists of a central axis with lateral lobes. The plant produces small, clustered capsules that are typically borne on short, erect stalks, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Cryptophragmium elongatum is often found in temperate regions, particularly in areas with rich, organic soil and high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
