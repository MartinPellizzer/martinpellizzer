                    <h1>Ctenitis pauciflora</h1>
<p>Ctenitis pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered ctenitis, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spores rather than flowers, which is why it is referred to as "sparse-flowered.". It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Ctenitis pauciflora is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists studying rare and threatened plant species.</p>
