                    <h1>Cyperus longus var. pallescens</h1>
<p>Cyperus longus var. pallescens, commonly known as the silver flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are often covered in a silvery or pale blue-gray bloom, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters.</p>
<p>This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
