                    <h1>Carex chordorrhiza var. major</h1>
<p>Carex chordorrhiza var. major, commonly known as the large root sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with slender, triangular stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually narrow and somewhat leathery, with a bluish-green hue that helps distinguish it from other sedges.</p>
