                    <h1>Chenopodium griseochlorinum f. integrifolium</h1>
<p>Chenopodium griseochlorinum f. integrifolium, commonly known as the gray-green goosefoot, is a variant of the Chenopodium genus characterized by its distinctive foliage.</p>
<p>This plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, grayish-blue waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The leaves are usually entire, meaning they lack teeth or lobes, a trait reflected in its subspecific name *integrifolium*. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically greenish or yellowish in color.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in semi-arid regions.</p>
