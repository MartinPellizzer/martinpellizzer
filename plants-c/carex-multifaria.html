<p>Carex multifaria, commonly known as the many-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands.</p>
<p>Carex multifaria is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
