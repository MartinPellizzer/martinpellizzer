<p>Chrysothamnus nauseosus var. frigidus, commonly known as the alpine goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine tundra and rocky slopes. Its small, glandular leaves are adapted to reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished from the typical form by its more compact growth habit and smaller stature.</p>
