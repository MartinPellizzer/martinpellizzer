<p>It is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Its leaves are covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Cliffortia ternata is often used in rock gardens and is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
