<p>Cystopteris sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian water clover, is a unique fern native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often covered in fine, scale-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coastal areas and forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms.</p>
