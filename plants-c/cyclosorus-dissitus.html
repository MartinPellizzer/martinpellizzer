<p>Cyclosorus dissitus, commonly known as the fluted water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Water Ferns.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often curled or twisted, giving it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are long and creeping, allowing it to spread across the substrate.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus dissitus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
