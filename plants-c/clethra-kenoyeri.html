                    <h1>Clethra kenoyeri</h1>
<p>Clethra kenoyeri, commonly known as the Kenoyeri sweet pepper, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Clethra genus.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Thailand and Vietnam. This plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the late spring and early summer. The leaves are oval-shaped with a glossy surface, and the plant generally grows as a shrub or small tree.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Clethra kenoyeri is considered a botanically significant but under-researched species.</p>
