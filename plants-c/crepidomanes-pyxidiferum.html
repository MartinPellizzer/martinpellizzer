                    <h1>Crepidomanes pyxidiferum</h1>
<p>Crepidomanes pyxidiferum, commonly known as the boxwood leaf gall, is a unique plant that exhibits specialized botanical features.</p>
<p>It is a type of gall-forming plant, which means it induces the growth of abnormal plant tissues in response to insect infestation. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a host for gall-forming insects and its contribution to the ecological diversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
