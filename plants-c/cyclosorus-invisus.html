                    <h1>Cyclosorus invisus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus invisus, commonly known as the invisible water fern, is a rare and elusive aquatic plant found in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, submerged leaves that are often difficult to detect. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizomes for anchoring and nutrient absorption. Its reproductive structures are concealed within its foliage, making it challenging to study.</p>
<p>Due to its cryptic nature, it is considered a rare and poorly understood species in botanical science.</p>
