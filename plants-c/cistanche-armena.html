<p>Cistanche armena, commonly known as the Armenian dodder, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to members of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers and has a distinctive, branched stem covered in small, scale-like leaves. It is native to regions of the Mediterranean and Central Asia, often growing in dry, arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and medicinal uses in traditional medicine, it is of interest to botanists and pharmacologists alike.</p>
