                    <h1>Caralluma corrugata</h1>
<p>Caralluma corrugata, commonly known as the wrinkled devil's tongue, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Caralluma corrugata is also valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
