<p>Calligonum arich, commonly known as the desert tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, multi-stemmed structure and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in panicles during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or saline soils.</p>
<p>Calligonum arich plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
