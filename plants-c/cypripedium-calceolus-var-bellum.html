                    <h1>Cypripedium calceolus var. bellum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium calceolus var. bellum, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinkish-white pouch-shaped flower, which is highly specialized for pollination by specific insects. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Its leaves are broad and oval, often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this species is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
