                            <h1>Clinopodium Piperitum</h1>
<p>Clinopodium piperitum, commonly known as wild basil, is a herbaceous plant native to regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by aromatic leaves and square stems. This plant is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are fragrant and have been used historically in culinary and medicinal applications. Despite its common name, it is not closely related to true basil, though it shares similar aromatic qualities.</p>
