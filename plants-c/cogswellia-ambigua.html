<p>Cogswellia ambigua, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, translucent leaves that give it a ghostly appearance, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. The plant is adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its thick, waxy leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts.</p>
