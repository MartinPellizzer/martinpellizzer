<p>Carex communis var. communis, commonly known as common sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, dark brown seeds.</p>
<p>Common sedge is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife.</p>
