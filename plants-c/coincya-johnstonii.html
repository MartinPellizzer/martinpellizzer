                    <h1>Coincya johnstonii</h1>
<p>Coincya johnstonii, commonly known as the Johnston's water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with long, thin roots submerged in the water. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters, often found in ponds and marshes. Its floral structure consists of tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, making it less noticeable to the naked eye.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
