                    <h1>Cephalanthera erecta f. subaphylla</h1>
<p>Cephalanthera erecta f. subaphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to specific regions of Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Mountains. The plant is distinguished by its reduced leaf structure, which is a key feature of the 'subaphylla' form. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, humus-filled soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range.</p>
