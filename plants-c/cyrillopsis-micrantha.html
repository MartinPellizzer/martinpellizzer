                    <h1>Cyrillopsis micrantha</h1>
<p>Cyrillopsis micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cyrillopsis micrantha is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
