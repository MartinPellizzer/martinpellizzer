<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, grasslands, and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
