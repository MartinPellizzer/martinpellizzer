                    <h1>Cheilanthes bonariensis</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes bonariensis, commonly known as the Argentine rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with tufted, lance-shaped fronds that are usually evergreen. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>This resilient fern is well adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a common sight in its native habitats across South America.</p>
