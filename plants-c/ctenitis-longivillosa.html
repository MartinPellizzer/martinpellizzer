<p>Ctenitis longivillosa, commonly known as the long-hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive hairy appearance, particularly on the underside of its fronds, which gives it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>The fronds are used in traditional medicine and basket weaving in some cultures.</p>
