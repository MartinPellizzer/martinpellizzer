<p>Chaetospora stygia, commonly known as the ghost sponge, is a deep-sea sponge that belongs to the family Halichondriidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching structure and translucent appearance, which helps it blend with its marine environment. The sponge's body is composed of a network of siliceous spicules, which provide structural support and defense against predators. It thrives in cold, dark waters and plays a role in nutrient cycling within deep-sea ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature, little is known about its full botanical and ecological characteristics.</p>
