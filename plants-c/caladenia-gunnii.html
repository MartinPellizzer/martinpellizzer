<p>Caladenia gunnii, commonly known as the Gunns' spider-orchid, is an orchid species native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and its striking, spider-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces a single, erect flower with a distinctive hooded labellum, which is a key feature in its identification. Caladenia gunnii is typically found in heathlands and open forests, often growing in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and threatened species.</p>
