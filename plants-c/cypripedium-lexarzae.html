                    <h1>Cypripedium lexarzae</h1>
<p>Cypripedium lexarzae, commonly known as the Lexarzae lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
