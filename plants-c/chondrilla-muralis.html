<p>Chondrilla muralis, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in rocky or calcareous soils. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Chondrilla muralis is an important species in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil in rocky environments.</p>
