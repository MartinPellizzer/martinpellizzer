<p>Chingyungia scutellarioidea, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and distinctive golden-colored fronds that contrast with its dark green base. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
