                    <h1>Cuscuta planiflora var. globularis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta planiflora var. globularis, commonly known as the globular dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique, spherical shape due to its clustered growth pattern. The plant's stems are covered in tiny, hair-like structures that help it attach to its host. It is often found growing on various agricultural crops and weeds.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable host plants, making it a common weed in disturbed environments.</p>
