<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle beauty to its alpine habitat. Cyrbasium jamesii thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
