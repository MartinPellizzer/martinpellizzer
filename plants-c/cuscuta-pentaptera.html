                    <h1>Cuscuta pentaptera</h1>
<p>Cuscuta pentaptera, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host to establish a connection. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to colonize a wide range of hosts. It is commonly found on crops such as soybeans and cotton, making it a significant agricultural pest.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to persist in various environments contribute to its widespread distribution.</p>
