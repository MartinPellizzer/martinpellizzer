                    <h1>Cuscuta vulgaris</h1>
<p>Cuscuta vulgaris, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize a wide range of host species. It is often found on crops like corn, beans, and sunflowers, causing economic damage in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unmanaged.</p>
