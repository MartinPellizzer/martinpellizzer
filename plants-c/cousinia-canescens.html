                    <h1>Cousinia canescens</h1>
<p>Cousinia canescens, commonly known as the woolly cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, pinkish or reddish flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to high altitudes and extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Cousinia canescens is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
