                    <h1>Ctenopteris yoderi</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris yoderi, commonly known as Yoder's sea holly, is a rare fern species native to the coastal regions of southern Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, blue-green fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments near the ocean, where it benefits from the coastal mist and salt spray. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a unique, clustered pattern.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ctenopteris yoderi is considered a conservation concern.</p>
