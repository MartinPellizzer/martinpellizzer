<p>Cucumis anguria subsp.</p>
<p>jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican bitter gourd, is a tropical vine native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It produces elongated, spiny fruits that are typically green when mature, though they may turn yellow or orange.</p>
<p>The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and is characterized by its vigorous climbing habit. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blooms, and it relies on insects for pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is often used in local cuisines, though it is generally less palatable than other cucurbit species due to its bitter taste.</p>
