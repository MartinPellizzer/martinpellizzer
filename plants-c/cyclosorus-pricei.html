                    <h1>Cyclosorus pricei</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus pricei, commonly known as the Price's cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to the freshwater ecosystems of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four parts, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters with soft, nutrient-rich substrates. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves, releasing spores into the water for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
