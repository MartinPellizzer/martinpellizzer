                    <h1>Carex tamana</h1>
<p>Carex tamana, commonly known as the Tamana sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, including Japan and China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. It produces small, clustered flowers that are often wind-pollinated, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Carex tamana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wet habitats.</p>
