<p>Cistus crispus var. vestitus, commonly known as the silver-haired rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features silver-white, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy pink or purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The leaves are covered in fine, glandular hairs that contribute to its distinctive appearance and aid in water conservation.</p>
