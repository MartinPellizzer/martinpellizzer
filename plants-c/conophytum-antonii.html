<p>Conophytum antonii, commonly known as the "Cape rose" or "stone plant," is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rosette-shaped body with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the summer months. Its leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water.</p>
<p>Conophytum antonii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
