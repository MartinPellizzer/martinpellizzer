                    <h1>Calamus setiger</h1>
<p>Calamus setiger, commonly known as the hairy calamus, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Aroid family, Araceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender rhizomes and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces inflorescences known as spadices, which consist of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Calamus setiger is typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist, humid conditions.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary ecological role is as a component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
