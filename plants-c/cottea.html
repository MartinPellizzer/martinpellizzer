                    <h1>Cottea</h1>
<p>Cottea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and indirect light, to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Cottea is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
