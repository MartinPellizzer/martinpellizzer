                    <h1>Cereus polyacanthus</h1>
<p>Cereus polyacanthus, commonly known as the Christmas star cactus, is a popular epiphytic cactus native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its segmented stems that branch into spiky, leaf-like structures called phylloclades. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming during the holiday season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Cereus polyacanthus is relatively low maintenance, making it a favored choice for indoor gardening.</p>
