                    <h1>Cladium teretifolium var. typicum</h1>
<p>Cladium teretifolium var. typicum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland ecosystems in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to prevent water loss. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater wetlands and is adapted to flooded conditions. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to the structure of wetland habitats.</p>
