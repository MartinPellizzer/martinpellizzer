<p>Ceropteris adiantoides var. peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian water fern, is a fern species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of true water ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are often submerged or partially submerged in water, which aids in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
