<p>Carex maritima subsp.</p>
<p>setina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal and brackish wetlands. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to saline and waterlogged soils, making it a common sight in estuaries and tidal marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to soil structure and nutrient cycling.</p>
