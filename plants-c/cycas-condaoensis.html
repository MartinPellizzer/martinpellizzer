<p>Cycas condaoensis, commonly known as the Condao cycas, is a rare cycad species native to the island of Condao in Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base of the plant and female cones emerging from the upper part of the stem. Cycas condaoensis is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
