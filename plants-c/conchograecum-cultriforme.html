                    <h1>Conchograecum cultriforme</h1>
<p>Conchograecum cultriforme, commonly known as the sword-shaped sea holly, is a striking member of the Aizoaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and sandy environments. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, sword-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers, which appear in spring, are typically yellow or orange and are borne in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Conchograecum cultriforme is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance.</p>
