<p>Cyanea salicina, commonly known as the Hawaiian sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
