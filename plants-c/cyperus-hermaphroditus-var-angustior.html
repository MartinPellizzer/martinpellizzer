                    <h1>Cyperus hermaphroditus var. angustior</h1>
<p>Cyperus hermaphroditus var. angustior, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, triangular seeds that are dispersed by water or wind.</p>
<p>This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
