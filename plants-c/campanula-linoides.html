<p>Campanula linoides, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or dry soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Campanula linoides is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments.</p>
