                    <h1>Carex pauciflora var. macroglossa</h1>
<p>Carex pauciflora var. macroglossa, commonly known as the broad-lip sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and specialized flowering structures called spikes. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a dense cluster of small, inconspicuous flowers at the top. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its broader, more prominent floral bracts compared to the typical form of C. pauciflora.</p>
