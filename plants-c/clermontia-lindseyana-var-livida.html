<p>Clermontia lindseyana var. livida, commonly known as the dark-leaved clermontia, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions.
