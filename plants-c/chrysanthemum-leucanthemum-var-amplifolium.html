<p>It is characterized by its large, white to pale yellow flower heads that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, which help it retain moisture in drier conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and wildflower gardens.</p>
<p>This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
