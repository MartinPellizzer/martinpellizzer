<p>Cereus mojavensis, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It is a cactus species that produces striking, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant has a tall, columnar stem with a spiny exterior, adapted to store water in its thick, fleshy tissue. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a single night, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths.</p>
<p>Cereus mojavensis is well-suited to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
