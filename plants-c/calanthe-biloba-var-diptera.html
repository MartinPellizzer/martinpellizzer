                    <h1>Calanthe biloba var. diptera</h1>
<p>Calanthe biloba var. diptera, commonly known as the winged calanthe, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on decaying organic matter. Its unique floral structure includes a prominent, wing-like lip that distinguishes it from other calanthe species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
