                    <h1>Chorisia ventricosa</h1>
<p>Chorisia ventricosa, commonly known as the bottle tree, is a striking plant native to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, swollen trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that range from white to pink and yellow, often in clusters at the ends of branches. Its leaves are palmate, with five to seven lobes, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The bark is fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
