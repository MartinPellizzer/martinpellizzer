<p>Caralluma decaisneana subsp.</p>
<p>hesperidum, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South Africa. It features fleshy, spiny stems that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are usually reduced to small spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its resilience and unique appearance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
