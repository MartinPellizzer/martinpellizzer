                    <h1>Cuscuta chinensis var. minor</h1>
<p>Cuscuta chinensis var. minor, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to Asia and is often found growing on crops such as rice and soybean. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can cause significant damage to agricultural plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in many regions.</p>
