                    <h1>Carex novae-angliae var. deflexa</h1>
<p>Carex novae-angliae var. deflexa, commonly known as the flexed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers in the summer, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its drooping or flexed leaf arrangement, which gives it its common name.</p>
