                    <h1>Cannabis generalis</h1>
<p>Cannabis generalis, commonly known as hemp, is a member of the Cannabaceae family and is native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and is characterized by its tall, fibrous stalks and broad, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically pollinated by wind. Its flowering period varies depending on the climate, but it generally blooms in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>Cannabis generalis is valued for its industrial uses, including fiber production, and contains low levels of THC compared to its psychoactive cousin, Cannabis sativa.</p>
