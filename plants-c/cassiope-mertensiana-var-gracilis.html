                    <h1>Cassiope mertensiana var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Cassiope mertensiana var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender cushion plant, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh, rocky environments and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pink and bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise muted appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in alpine and tundra habitats.</p>
