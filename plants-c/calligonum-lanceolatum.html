                    <h1>Calligonum lanceolatum</h1>
<p>Calligonum lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well-suited for harsh environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deep underground.</p>
<p>Calligonum lanceolatum plays an important role in stabilizing soils and preventing erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
