<p>Carlephyton diegoense, commonly known as Diego's carlephyton, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows in sandy soils near the shoreline, where it thrives in the moist, saline conditions of the coastal environment. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Carlephyton diegoense is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
