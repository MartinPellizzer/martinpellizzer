                    <h1>Clitocyamos pinnatifidus</h1>
<p>Clitocyamos pinnatifidus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along the stem, and it produces small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant relies on its host for nutrients and water, forming a symbiotic relationship that can sometimes be detrimental to the host's health. Its berries, which are usually red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Clitocyamos pinnatifidus is an interesting example of a hemiparasitic plant that plays a role in both ecological and ornamental contexts.</p>
