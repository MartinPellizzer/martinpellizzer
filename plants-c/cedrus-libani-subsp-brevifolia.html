<p>Cedrus libani subsp.</p>
<p>brevifolia, commonly known as the Lebanon cedar subspecies with short leaves, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountains of Lebanon. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and short, scale-like leaves that are densely packed on the shoots.</p>
<p>The tree produces cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to the more widely known Cedrus libani, but it is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences.</p>
