<p>Cyathea albomarginata, commonly known as the white-edged tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a unique structure with a central stem covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rhizome. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which is believed to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and swampy areas.</p>
