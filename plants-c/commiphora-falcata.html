                    <h1>Commiphora falcata</h1>
<p>Commiphora falcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved myrrh, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and produces a fragrant resin that has been historically used in incense and traditional medicine. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Its resin, known as myrrh, is collected by making incisions in the bark, allowing the sap to exude and harden.</p>
<p>Commiphora falcata is part of the Burseraceae family, which includes other resin-producing plants like frankincense.</p>
