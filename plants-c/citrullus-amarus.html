<p>Citrullus amarus, commonly known as bitter cucumber, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plant produces small, bitter-tasting fruits that are typically harvested when immature. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, and the vines are trailing, often climbing supports.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its edible young fruits, though its bitterness limits its culinary use compared to other cucurbits.</p>
