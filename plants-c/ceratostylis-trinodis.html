<p>Ceratostylis trinodis, commonly known as the three-node sword fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its erect, slender rhizome and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are pinnate, with a delicate, grass-like appearance.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
