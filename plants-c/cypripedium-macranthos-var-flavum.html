                    <h1>Cypripedium macranthos var. flavum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium macranthos var. flavum, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a large, showy yellow pouch-like flower that attracts pollinators such as bees and wasps. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a rhizomatous root system. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
