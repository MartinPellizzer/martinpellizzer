                    <h1>Cryosophila</h1>
<p>Cryosophila, commonly known as the snow lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in extremely cold environments, often blooming during the brief summer months when the snow begins to melt. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand harsh winds and low temperatures. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, with a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators like bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, Cryosophila is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from climate change and habitat loss.</p>
