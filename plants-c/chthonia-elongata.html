                    <h1>Chthonia elongata</h1>
<p>Chthonia elongata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, elongated floral structure that resembles a ghostly apparition. The plant relies on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient absorption, as it cannot photosynthesize due to its absence of chlorophyll. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Chthonia elongata is listed as endangered, making it a subject of conservation interest.</p>
