                    <h1>Cactus conopseus</h1>
<p>Cactus conopseus, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture quickly during rare rainfall events.</p>
<p>Cactus conopseus is well-suited to harsh desert environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
