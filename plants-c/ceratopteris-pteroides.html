<p>Ceratopteris pteroides, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a member of the fern family and is characterized by its large, floating fronds.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions and thrives in moist, aquatic environments. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing spores on the underside of its fronds rather than seeds. Its fronds are divided into small, finger-like segments that help in photosynthesis and buoyancy.</p>
<p>It is often used in scientific research due to its rapid growth and ease of cultivation.</p>
