<p>Cardamine cryptantha var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaf watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, pinnatifid leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to that of watercress.</p>
