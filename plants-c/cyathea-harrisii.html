<p>Cyathea harrisii, commonly known as the Harris's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in rainforests or along riverbanks. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its tall stature and enabling it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Cyathea harrisii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various forest organisms.</p>
