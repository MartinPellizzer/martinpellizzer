<p>Cordylostigma prolixipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that thrives on a variety of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white flowers. The plant produces fleshy, sticky berries that are a food source for birds and other animals. Its root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance and unique parasitic nature, it plays an important role in forest ecosystems.</p>
