                    <h1>Cylicodaphne unita</h1>
<p>Cylicodaphne unita, commonly known as the slender sago palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnately compound leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by clustered berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>However, it contains cycasin, a toxic compound, so care must be taken when handling it.</p>
