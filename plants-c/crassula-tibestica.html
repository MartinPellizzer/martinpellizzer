                    <h1>Crassula tibestica</h1>
<p>Crassula tibestica, commonly known as the Tibesti Crassula, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the Tibesti Mountains in Chad.</p>
<p>It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green, adapted to store water and withstand harsh desert conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the dry season. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a hardy choice for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
