<p>Clidemia urceolata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false mallow, is a tropical flowering plant native to the Caribbean and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy texture, while its stems are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Clidemia urceolata is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
