                    <h1>Calyptrochilum malangeanum</h1>
<p>Calyptrochilum malangeanum, commonly known as the Malangean orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which features a specialized labellum that aids in pollination. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, anchoring itself to tree bark while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are usually small and colorful, often displaying a combination of white, yellow, and green hues.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Calyptrochilum malangeanum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
