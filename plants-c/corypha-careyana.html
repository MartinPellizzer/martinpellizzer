                    <h1>Corypha careyana</h1>
<p>Corypha careyana, commonly known as the giant palm or coconut palm, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 6 meters. The plant produces large, clustered inflorescences with yellow flowers, which eventually develop into the familiar coconut fruits. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize coastal soils, making it valuable for erosion control.</p>
<p>Corypha careyana is also cultivated for its ornamental value and economic importance due to its fruit and palm oil.</p>
