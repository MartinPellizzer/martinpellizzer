<p>Clinostigma haerestigma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus.</p>
<p>It possesses small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its often arid environment. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that serve as a food source for various birds and small mammals. Clinostigma haerestigma is native to Australia and is often found in coastal regions where its host trees thrive.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from the host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
