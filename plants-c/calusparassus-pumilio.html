<p>Calusparassus pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf calusparassus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
