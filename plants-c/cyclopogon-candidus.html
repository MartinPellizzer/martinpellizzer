                    <h1>Cyclopogon candidus</h1>
<p>Cyclopogon candidus, commonly known as the white cyclopogon, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant grows as an epiphyte, often found in cloud forests where it attaches to trees and absorbs moisture from the air. Its leaves form a rosette that helps retain water, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
