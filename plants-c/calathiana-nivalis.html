                    <h1>Calathiana nivalis</h1>
<p>Calathiana nivalis, commonly known as the snow calathia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Calathiana nivalis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
