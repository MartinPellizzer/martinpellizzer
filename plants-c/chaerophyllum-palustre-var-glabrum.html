                    <h1>Chaerophyllum palustre var. glabrum</h1>
<p>Chaerophyllum palustre var. glabrum, commonly known as swamp cow parsley, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of basal leaves that are usually hairless, giving it the "glabrum" designation. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in aquatic environments.</p>
