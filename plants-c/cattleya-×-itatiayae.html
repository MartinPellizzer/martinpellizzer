<p>Cattleya × itatiayae, commonly known as the Itatiaya orchid, is a hybrid orchid native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange, with a distinctive red or purple lip. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. It produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The orchid is popular among horticulturists for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
