                    <h1>Cyperus squarrosus var. cylindraceus</h1>
<p>Cyperus squarrosus var. cylindraceus, commonly known as the cylindrical flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and floodplains, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant features slender, grass-like stems that often form dense clumps, with narrow, linear leaves that are usually pale green in color. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in clusters, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its cylindrical, swollen base and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity.</p>
