<p>Cylactis arcticus subsp.</p>
<p>acaulis, commonly known as the arctic bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic regions. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold climates.</p>

<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it plays a vital role in the ecological balance of Arctic ecosystems.</p>
