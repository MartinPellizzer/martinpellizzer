                    <h1>Chilopogon merrillii</h1>
<p>Chilopogon merrillii, commonly known as the Hainan cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of Hainan in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is typically dioecious, meaning male and female plants are separate. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected under international conservation agreements.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a significant subject in botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
