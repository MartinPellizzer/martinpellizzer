                    <h1>Carex tumidula</h1>
<p>Carex tumidula, commonly known as the inflated sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes over 5,000 species of grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Carex tumidula is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils.</p>
