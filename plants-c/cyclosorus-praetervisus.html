                    <h1>Cyclosorus praetervisus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus praetervisus, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique circular pattern along the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus praetervisus is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
