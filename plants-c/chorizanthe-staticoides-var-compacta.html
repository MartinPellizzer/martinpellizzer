<p>Chorizanthe staticoides var. compacta, commonly known as the compact choris, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer. It has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in poor soils and drought conditions.</p>
<p>The compact growth habit of this variety makes it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
