<p>Cystopteris chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water.</p>
<p>Cystopteris chilensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality regulation.</p>
