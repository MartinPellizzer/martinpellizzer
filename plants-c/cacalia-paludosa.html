<p>Cacalia paludosa, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale blue. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in moist, poorly drained soils. It is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Cacalia paludosa plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators.</p>
