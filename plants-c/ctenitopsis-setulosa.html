                    <h1>Ctenitopsis setulosa</h1>
<p>Ctenitopsis setulosa, commonly known as the hairy tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, scale-like leaves that are densely covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Ctenitopsis setulosa is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
