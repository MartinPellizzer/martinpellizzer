                    <h1>Callitriche stellata</h1>
<p>Callitriche stellata, commonly known as starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped leaves that are typically floating or submerged, depending on the water conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are often clustered near the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches.</p>
<p>Callitriche stellata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
