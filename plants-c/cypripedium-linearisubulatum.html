                    <h1>Cypripedium linearisubulatum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium linearisubulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like lip that is often brightly colored, typically in shades of pink or yellow. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears a few showy flowers, each with a distinct, intricate structure. Its leaves are linear and often clustered at the base, contributing to its overall elegant appearance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this species is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
