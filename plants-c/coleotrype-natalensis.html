<p>Coleotrype natalensis, commonly known as Natal's coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, coral-like inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients, making it a mycoheterotroph. It typically grows on the trunks of trees in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it blooms during the warmer months of the year.</p>
