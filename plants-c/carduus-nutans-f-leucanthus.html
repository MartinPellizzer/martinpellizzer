                    <h1>Carduus nutans f. leucanthus</h1>
<p>Carduus nutans f. leucanthus, commonly known as the white-flowered sagewort, is a botanical variant of the common thistle.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the typical purple of the species. This form is a naturally occurring mutation that results in a less aggressive growth pattern compared to the standard variety. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>The plant's foliage is typically gray-green with spiny leaves, making it easily identifiable in the wild.</p>
