                    <h1>Carya ovata var. complanata</h1>
<p>Carya ovata var. complanata, commonly known as the flat-leaf hickory, is a variant of the bitternut hickory.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that distinguish it from the typical ovate leaves of the main species. The plant is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States, typically found in moist, well-drained soils. Its fruits are small, spiny nuts that mature in the fall, and the tree produces a strong, aromatic scent when the leaves are crushed.</p>
<p>The flat-leaf hickory is valued for its hard wood and is often found in mixed hardwood forests.</p>
