                    <h1>Callista draconis</h1>
<p>Callista draconis, commonly known as the dragon's callista, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the remote highlands of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting a variety of pollinators. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. Its scientific name reflects both its appearance and the mythological significance attributed to it in local MƒÅori culture.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Callista draconis is considered endangered and is the subject of ongoing conservation efforts.</p>
