                    <h1>Cuscuta legitima</h1>
<p>Cuscuta legitima, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant's seeds are dispersed through the wind, allowing it to colonize a wide range of host species. It is often found on crops such as soybeans and cotton, causing significant agricultural damage.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, with the plant growing and reproducing in direct association with the host's vascular system.</p>
