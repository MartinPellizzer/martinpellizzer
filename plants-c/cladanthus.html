                    <h1>Cladanthus</h1>
<p>Cladanthus, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils, and it often grows in rocky or disturbed areas. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cladanthus produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its propagation in harsh environments.</p>
