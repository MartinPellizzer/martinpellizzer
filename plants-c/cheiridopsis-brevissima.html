                    <h1>Cheiridopsis brevissima</h1>
<p>Cheiridopsis brevissima, commonly known as the dwarf ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the winter months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
