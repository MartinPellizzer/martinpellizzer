<p>Crassula albertiniae, commonly known as the "Little Rose" or "Compact Crassula," is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a slight red or purple tinge under direct sunlight. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring or early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens, containers, or as part of a succulent arrangement due to its compact size and ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Crassula albertiniae requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive, making it ideal for arid or semi-arid climates.</p>
