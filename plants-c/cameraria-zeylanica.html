                    <h1>Cameraria zeylanica</h1>
<p>Cameraria zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon leaf miner, is a small moth species belonging to the family Lyonetiidae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Indian subcontinent and is known for its larvae that feed on the leaves of various plants, including tea and citrus. The larvae create distinctive leaf mines, which are winding tunnels within the leaf tissue, causing visible damage. The adult moths are tiny, with wingspan less than 5 mm, and are often overlooked due to their size.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, contributing to the natural cycle of plant decomposition and nutrient recycling.</p>
