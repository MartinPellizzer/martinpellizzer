                    <h1>Caltha palustris var. umbrosa</h1>
<p>Caltha palustris var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving marsh marigold, is a variant of the marsh marigold native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role as a nectar source for early pollinators and its ability to stabilize wetland soils.</p>
