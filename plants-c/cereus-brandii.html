                    <h1>Cereus brandii</h1>
<p>Cereus brandii, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height, often resembling a ghostly figure due to its pale coloration. The plant produces striking, nocturnal flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, opening only during the evening. These flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a single night before wilting.</p>
<p>Botanically, Cereus brandii is notable for its ability to thrive in extreme desert conditions with minimal water and high sunlight exposure.</p>
