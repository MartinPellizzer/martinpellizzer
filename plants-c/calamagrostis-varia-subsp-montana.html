<p>Calamagrostis varia subsp.</p>
<p>montana, commonly known as the mountain bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and slender, upright growth habit.</p>
<p>The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, low-growing mats.</p>
