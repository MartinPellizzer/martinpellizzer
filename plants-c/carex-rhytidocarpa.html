                    <h1>Carex rhytidocarpa</h1>
<p>Carex rhytidocarpa, commonly known as the scaly sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves are often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid or semi-arid habitats.</p>
<p>Carex rhytidocarpa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in moist to wet soils.</p>
