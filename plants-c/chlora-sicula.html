                    <h1>Chlora sicula</h1>
<p>Chlora sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian Chlorine Plant, is a rare flowering species native to the island of Sicily.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or limestone areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chlora sicula is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
