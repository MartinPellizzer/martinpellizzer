                    <h1>Cithareloma gedrosiacum</h1>
<p>Cithareloma gedrosiacum, commonly known as the Gedrosian tamarisk, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are often covered in a layer of salt-crusted bark, an adaptation to high salinity and extreme drought.</p>
<p>This resilient species is well-suited to desert and semi-desert habitats, playing a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
