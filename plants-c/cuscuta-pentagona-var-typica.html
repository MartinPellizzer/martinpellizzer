                    <h1>Cuscuta pentagona var. typica</h1>
<p>Cuscuta pentagona var. typica, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on crops such as soybeans and sunflowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can be a significant agricultural pest.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it has a complex relationship with its host, affecting both plant growth and yield.</p>
