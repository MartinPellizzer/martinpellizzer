                    <h1>Ctenitis opposita</h1>
<p>Ctenitis opposita, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, leathery fronds that are often divided into segments with a distinctive, tooth-like appearance. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Ctenitis opposita is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in wet, shaded conditions.</p>
