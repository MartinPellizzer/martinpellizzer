                    <h1>Cystopteris dalhousiana</h1>
<p>Cystopteris dalhousiana, commonly known as the Dalhousie water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's intricate structure and reproductive features make it a notable example of fern morphology and ecology.</p>
