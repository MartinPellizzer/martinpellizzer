The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by prickly, spherical seed heads. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Carduus callilepis is adapted to survive in harsh environments, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
