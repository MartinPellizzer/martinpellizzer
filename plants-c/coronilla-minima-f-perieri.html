                    <h1>Coronilla minima f. perieri</h1>
<p>Coronilla minima f. perieri, commonly known as the dwarf crown vetch, is a low-growing leguminous plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces delicate, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry environments. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil enrichment.</p>
<p>However, it is often considered invasive in some regions due to its vigorous growth and ability to spread readily.</p>
