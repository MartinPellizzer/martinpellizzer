<p>Chamaecrista acosmifolia var. euryloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf crown flower, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded environments.</p>
