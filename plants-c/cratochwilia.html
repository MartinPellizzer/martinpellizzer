<p>Cratochwilia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Cratochwilia thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in swamp forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
