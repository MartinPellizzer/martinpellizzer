<p>Coral bells, scientifically known as Codonanthe calcarata, are a striking addition to any garden with their vibrant foliage and unique appearance. Native to South America, these plants thrive in shaded to partially sunny conditions and are prized for their ornamental value. Their leaves, which range from deep green to reddish hues, create a dramatic visual contrast against their surroundings. While they are relatively low-maintenance, they require well-draining soil and consistent moisture to flourish. Overall, Coral bells offer a beautiful and easy-to-care-for option for gardeners seeking to add texture and color to their landscapes.</p>
