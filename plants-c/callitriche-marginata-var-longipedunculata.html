                    <h1>Callitriche marginata var. longipedunculata</h1>
<p>Callitriche marginata var. longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-pedunculate water starwort, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and slender stems.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The leaves are usually oval-shaped with a waxy coating, and the plant produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its long peduncles, or stalks, support the flowers and are a distinguishing feature of this variety.</p>
<p>This plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through oxygenation.</p>
