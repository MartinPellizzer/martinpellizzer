                    <h1>Cyanococcus vacillans</h1>
<p>Cyanococcus vacillans, commonly known as the wavering blue moss, is a unique species of cyanobacteria that forms dense, carpet-like colonies.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant's structure consists of filamentous cells that intertwine to create a cohesive mat. It is capable of photosynthesis and can fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
<p>Its vibrant blue-green color is due to the presence of phycocyanin, a pigment common in cyanobacteria.</p>
