                    <h1>Cuscuta durangana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta durangana, commonly known as the Durango dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous yellow or green flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hairless stems. The plant is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it commonly parasitizes various grasses and shrubs. Its life cycle involves germinating on the surface of host plants and then establishing a connection through specialized root-like structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>Cuscuta durangana plays a role in ecological interactions by influencing the growth and distribution of its host species.</p>
