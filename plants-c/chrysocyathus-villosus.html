<p>Chrysocyathus villosus, commonly known as the hairy cyathus, is a unique member of the family Cyathaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, cup-shaped structure called a cyathium, which houses its reduced flowers. Its hairy stems and leaves contribute to its identification and help in water retention.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Chrysocyathus villosus make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and ecology.</p>
