<p>Callitriche elegans f. submersa, commonly known as the submerged water starwort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves that are fully submerged. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that emerge from the water surface, often in clusters. Its stems are slender and flexible, adapted for life in aquatic conditions.</p>
<p>It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
