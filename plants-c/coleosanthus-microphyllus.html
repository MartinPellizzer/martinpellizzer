                    <h1>Coleosanthus microphyllus</h1>
<p>Coleosanthus microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
