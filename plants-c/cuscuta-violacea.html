                    <h1>Cuscuta violacea</h1>
<p>Cuscuta violacea, commonly known as the purple dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant's vine-like structure allows it to缠绕 and attach to various host species, including crops and wild plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Cuscuta violacea is considered an agricultural pest in many regions due to its ability to weaken and damage host plants.</p>
