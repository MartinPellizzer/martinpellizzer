                    <h1>Cheilanthes corsica</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes corsica, commonly known as the Corsican rock fern, is a species of fern native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in rocky, dry environments, often growing on limestone or sandstone substrates. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form with dense, leathery fronds that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes corsica is well adapted to Mediterranean climates and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
