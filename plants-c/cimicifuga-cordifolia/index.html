                            <h1>Cimicifuga Cordifolia</h1>
<p>Cimicifuga cordifolia, also known as heart-leaved bugbane, is a striking plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and tall, spiky flower clusters that bloom in late summer. This perennial herb thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Its common name comes from the shape of its foliage, which resembles a beating heart. Despite its beauty, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
