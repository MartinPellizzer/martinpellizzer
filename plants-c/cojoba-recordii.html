                    <h1>Cojoba recordii</h1>
<p>Cojoba recordii, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red bark, which contains high concentrations of tannins, and its ability to thrive in brackish water environments. The plant has aerial roots, known as pneumatophores, that help it extract oxygen from the air, adapting to waterlogged soil conditions. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cojoba recordii plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
