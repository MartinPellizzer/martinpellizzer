                    <h1>Conophallus tuberculiger</h1>
<p>Conophallus tuberculiger, commonly known as the wrinkled conophallus, is a rare and unusual member of the Lepidoptera family, specifically the Psychidae, which includes the bagworms.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its unique, tuberculate (wart-like) surface and a conical structure that resembles a small, spiny cone. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's morphology includes a central stem with spirally arranged, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Conophallus tuberculiger is often found in protected areas and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
