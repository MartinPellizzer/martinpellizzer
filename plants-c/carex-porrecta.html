                    <h1>Carex porrecta</h1>
<p>Carex porrecta, commonly known as the flatleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Carex porrecta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
