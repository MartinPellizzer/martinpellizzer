<p>Cheilanthes buchtienii, commonly known as the Buchtien's rock fern, is a species of fern found in arid and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It typically grows on limestone or sandstone, forming dense mats in crevices.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in harsh environments.</p>
