                    <h1>Cereus macrogonus</h1>
<p>Cereus macrogonus, commonly known as the giant night bloomer, is a cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a few hours, and are a striking feature of the plant's botanical profile.</p>
