                    <h1>Cleobula pinnata</h1>
<p>Cleobula pinnata, commonly known as the featherleaf sedge, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, feather-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, forming a low, mat-like structure that helps stabilize soil in wet environments. Cleobula pinnata produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
