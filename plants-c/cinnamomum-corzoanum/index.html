                            <h1>Cinnamomum Corzoanum</h1>
<p>Cordia, scientifically known as Cinnamomum corzoanum, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. This evergreen shrub or small tree is characterized by its aromatic leaves and distinctive, waxy fruits that attract a variety of wildlife. Despite its ornamental value, it remains largely unknown to the general public due to its limited distribution and cultivation. Its essential oils are prized in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. However, habitat destruction and climate change pose significant threats to its survival in the wild.</p>
