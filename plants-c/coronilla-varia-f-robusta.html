<p>Coronilla varia f. robusta, commonly known as the robust form of the variable coronilla, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>It is often used in dryland restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen.</p>
