                    <h1>Cerastium alpinum var. sordidum</h1>
<p>Cerastium alpinum var. sordidum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, pale green to grayish leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings.</p>
