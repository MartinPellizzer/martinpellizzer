                    <h1>Crataegus monogyna var. insularis</h1>
<p>Crataegus monogyna var. insularis, commonly known as the island hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the British Isles.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows or woodland edges.</p>
<p>This variety is distinct from the common hawthorn due to its smaller size and specific geographic distribution.</p>
