                    <h1>Ceterach papaverifolium</h1>
<p>Ceterach papaverifolium, commonly known as the papaver leaf ceterach, is a rare and unique plant native to the eastern coast of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, often in shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, papaver-like leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble those of the poppy family. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in spring and are clustered in terminal inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
