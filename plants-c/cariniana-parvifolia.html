<p>Cariniana parvifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are alternate along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, sweet fruits that are encased in a spiny husk. Cariniana parvifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, it is now considered endangered due to habitat loss and overharvesting.</p>
