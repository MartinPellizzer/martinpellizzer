<p>Ctenitis bidecorata, commonly known as the double-fronded sea holly, is a marine plant belonging to the family Zosteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive branching structure and the presence of specialized structures called rhizoids that anchor it to substrates in intertidal zones. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for pollination by water currents. Its leaves are typically narrow and ribbon-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms.</p>
