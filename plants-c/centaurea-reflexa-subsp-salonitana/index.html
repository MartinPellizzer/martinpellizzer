                            <h1>Centaurea Reflexa Subsp. Salonitana</h1>
<p>Salonitan thistle, scientifically known as Centaurea reflexa subsp. salonitana, is a striking member of the thistle family native to the Mediterranean region. This perennial plant is characterized by its spiny leaves and vibrant purple flowers that bloom in late spring and summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas of southern Europe. Despite its prickly appearance, the Salonitan thistle plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it a fascinating subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
