                    <h1>Cargillia maritima</h1>
<p>Cargillia maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and spiny, lobed leaves adapted to salt-laden environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Its short stature and drought tolerance make it well-suited for coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Cargillia maritima plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small coastal organisms.</p>
