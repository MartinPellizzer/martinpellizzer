                    <h1>Calyptropsidium ekmanii</h1>
<p>Calyptropsidium ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekman's ghostflower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is notable for its unique morphology, featuring a short, stocky stem and narrow, linear leaves. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the top of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calyptropsidium ekmanii is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
