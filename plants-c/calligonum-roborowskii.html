<p>Calligonum roborowskii, commonly known as the Roborowskii saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Calligonum roborowskii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
