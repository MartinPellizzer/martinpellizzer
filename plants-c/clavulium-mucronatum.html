<p>Clavulium mucronatum, commonly known as the sharp-pointed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, leafless stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it can thrive in still or slow-moving water. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, with small flowers that are often submerged or partially submerged.</p>
<p>Clavulium mucronatum plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems but is an indicator species for nutrient-rich waters.</p>
