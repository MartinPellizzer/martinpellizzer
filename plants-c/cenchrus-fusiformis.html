                    <h1>Cenchrus fusiformis</h1>
<p>Cenchrus fusiformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Cenchrus fusiformis is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions, making it a common component of desert and coastal vegetation.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh environments.</p>
