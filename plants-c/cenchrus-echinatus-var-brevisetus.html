                    <h1>Cenchrus echinatus var. brevisetus</h1>
<p>Cenchrus echinatus var. brevisetus, commonly known as the short-bristled sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often used for soil stabilization and has some traditional uses in local communities.</p>
