                    <h1>Crataegus suecica</h1>
<p>Crataegus suecica, commonly known as the Swedish hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to elliptic leaves, and clusters of small white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits called pomes in the autumn, which are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus suecica is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and ornamental purposes.</p>
