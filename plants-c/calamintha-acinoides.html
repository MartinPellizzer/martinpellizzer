<p>Calamintha acinoides, commonly known as creeping calamint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, hairy leaves with a distinctive mint-like scent, which is due to the presence of essential oils.

It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
