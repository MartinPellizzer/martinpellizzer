The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome and produces showy, fragrant blooms that attract specific pollinators. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
