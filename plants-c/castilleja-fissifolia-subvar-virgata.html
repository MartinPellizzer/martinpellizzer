                    <h1>Castilleja fissifolia subvar. virgata</h1>
<p>Castilleja fissifolia subvar. virgata, commonly known as the fissured leaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vivid red or orange floral bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its roots penetrate the roots of neighboring plants to obtain water and nutrients, making it a partial parasite.</p>
<p>The subspecies virgata is distinguished by its finely divided, fissured leaves and smaller, more clustered flowers compared to other varieties.</p>
