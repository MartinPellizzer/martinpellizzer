                    <h1>Cinnamomum rivulorum</h1>
<p>Cinnamomum rivulorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinnamon or Indian cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by oval, reddish-brown fruits containing a single seed. Its bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to cinnamon.</p>
<p>However, it is not as commercially significant as other cinnamon species.</p>
