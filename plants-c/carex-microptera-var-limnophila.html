The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to aquatic conditions, often found in ponds, ditches, and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet habitats, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems.</p>
