                    <h1>Cyperus cyrtolepis var. denticarinatus</h1>
<p>Cyperus cyrtolepis var. denticarinatus, commonly known as the denticulate flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in moist soils.</p>
<p>It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
