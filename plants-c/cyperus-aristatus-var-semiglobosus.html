                    <h1>Cyperus aristatus var. semiglobosus</h1>
<p>Cyperus aristatus var. semiglobosus, commonly known as the globular flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a low-growing rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in wetland and aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
