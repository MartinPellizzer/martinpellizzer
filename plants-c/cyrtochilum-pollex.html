                    <h1>Cyrtochilum pollex</h1>
<p>Cyrtochilum pollex, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like flower that resembles a slipper, with a vibrant pink or reddish hue. The plant has a compact growth habit, typically reaching only a few inches in height, and features broad, lance-shaped leaves. Cyrtochilum pollex is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
