<p>Cephalocereus nobilis var. nigricans, commonly known as the Black Thorn Cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a tall, columnar cactus with dark green, ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its distinctive black spines are dense and provide protection against herbivores.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and minimizing transpiration through its waxy surface.</p>
