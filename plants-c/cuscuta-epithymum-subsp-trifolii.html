<p>Cuscuta epithymum subsp.</p>
<p>trifolii, commonly known as the three-leaved dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched stem covered in tiny, adhesive twining structures called haustoria, which attach to the host.</p>
<p>The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves seed germination, attachment to a host, and the development of a network of haustoria to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The three-leaved dodder is an example of a holoparasitic species, meaning it cannot survive without a host.</p>
