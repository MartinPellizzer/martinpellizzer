                    <h1>Cedrus libani f. nana</h1>
<p>Cedrus libani f. nana, commonly known as the miniature Lebanon cedar, is a compact form of the Lebanon cedar, characterized by its dwarf growth habit.</p>
<p>It features dense, scale-like foliage that gives it a bushy appearance, and its cones are typically smaller than those of the standard species. This form is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its size. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in a variety of garden settings.</p>
