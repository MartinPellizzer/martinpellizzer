                    <h1>Coryphopteris viscosa var. borneensis</h1>
<p>Coryphopteris viscosa var. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean sticky holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, serrated fronds that are often covered in a fine, sticky substance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid and nutrient-rich environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky substrates or decaying organic matter.</p>
<p>The varietal form, borneensis, is distinguished by its specific morphological traits adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Borneo.</p>
