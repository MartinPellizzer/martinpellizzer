                    <h1>Cirsium × rollowii</h1>
<p>Cirsium × rollowii, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Cirsium arvense (Canada thistle) and Cirsium vulgare (common thistle), resulting in a plant with traits from both parents. The species is characterized by its spiny, leafy stems and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a wide range of morphological variability.</p>
