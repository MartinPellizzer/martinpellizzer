                    <h1>Cephalanthera latifolia f. collina</h1>
<p>Cephalanthera latifolia f. collina, commonly known as the alpine broad-leaved lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>This variant exhibits broader leaves compared to the typical form, adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environments where it grows. It produces a dense, fragrant spike of pinkish-white flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is often found in calcareous soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
