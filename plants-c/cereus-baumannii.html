<p>Cereus baumannii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces large, white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong fragrance. Its succulent leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Cereus baumannii is well adapted to desert conditions, storing water in its thick stems and thriving in full sun.</p>
