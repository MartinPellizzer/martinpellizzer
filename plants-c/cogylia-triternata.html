                    <h1>Cogylia triternata</h1>
<p>Cogylia triternata, commonly known as the three-parted cogon grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a triangular pattern. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural areas.</p>
