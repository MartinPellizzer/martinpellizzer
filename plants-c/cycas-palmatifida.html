                    <h1>Cycas palmatifida</h1>
<p>Cycas palmatifida, commonly known as the broad-leafed cycad, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves that give it a palm-like appearance. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Cycas palmatifida is a slow-growing, evergreen plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
<p>Its ancient lineage dates back to the Mesozoic era, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance.</p>
