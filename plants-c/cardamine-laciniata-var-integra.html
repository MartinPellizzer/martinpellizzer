<p>Cardamine laciniata var. integra, commonly known as the smooth water shield, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, toothed leaves that are typically smooth and not lobed, distinguishing it from other varieties of Cardamine. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Its leaves are often submerged or partially submerged in water, adapting to wetland environments.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic invertebrates and as a indicator plant for wetland health.</p>
