                    <h1>Cyanella lineata</h1>
<p>Cyanella lineata, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a member of the Poaceae family, though it is often mistaken for a flowering plant due to its grass-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, sandy soils, often found in coastal dunes or wetlands. The plant features slender, grass-like blades with small, clustered blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often have a bluish-gray hue, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Cyanella lineata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
