                            <h1>Camara Sellowiana</h1>
<p>Sellow's camara, scientifically known as Camara sellowiana, is a striking plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of red and yellow. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses. Despite its beauty, it is also known for its toxic properties, which have led to caution in its handling. Camara sellowiana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting various pollinators and contributing to biodiversity.</p>
