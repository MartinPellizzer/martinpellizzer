<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a striking blue-gray coloration that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant features dense, spiny stems covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are typically pale blue or purple, appearing in the spring and attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
