                    <h1>Campella</h1>
<p>Campella, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves, often with a distinctive reddish hue. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with a pea-like structure typical of the legume family. Campella species are native to various regions in Africa and are valued for their hard, durable wood.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, many species are now threatened with extinction.</p>
