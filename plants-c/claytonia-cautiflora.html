<p>Claytonia cautiflora, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, alpine habitat. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its rocky surroundings. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and open slopes at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
