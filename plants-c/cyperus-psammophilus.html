                    <h1>Cyperus psammophilus</h1>
<p>Cyperus psammophilus, commonly known as the sandplain flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in loose, dry substrates.</p>
<p>Cyperus psammophilus plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats.</p>
