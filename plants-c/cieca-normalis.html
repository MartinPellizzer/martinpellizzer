<p>Cieca normalis, commonly known as the common bladderworts, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures used for trapping small aquatic organisms. They are typically found in wetlands, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Cieca normalis species are carnivorous, supplementing their nutrient intake by digesting captured prey.</p>
<p>Their botanical features include slender stems, whorled leaves, and specialized trap organs that facilitate predation.</p>
