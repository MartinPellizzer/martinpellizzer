                    <h1>Cystopteris fragilis var. apiiformis</h1>
<p>Cystopteris fragilis var. apiiformis, commonly known as the fragrant water fern, is a varietal form of the brittle bladder fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in clusters along the edges of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
