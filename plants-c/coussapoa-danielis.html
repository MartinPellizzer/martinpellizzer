                    <h1>Coussapoa danielis</h1>
<p>Coussapoa danielis, commonly known as the Daniel's cupuaçu, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to the Amazon rainforest of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces edible, bean-like fruits that are similar in appearance to cupuaçu but are less commonly cultivated. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and potential ecological role within its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species.</p>
