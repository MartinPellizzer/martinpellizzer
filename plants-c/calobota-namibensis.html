<p>Calobota namibensis, commonly known as the Namibian rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the hyperarid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant is adapted to extreme drought conditions, with a compact growth form and a deep root system to access limited water. Its leaves are succulent, helping to reduce water loss, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during brief rainy seasons.</p>
