<p>Conophytum amplum, commonly known as the "Lamb's Ear" or "Cape Plush," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as a cuticle, which reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Conophytum amplum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
