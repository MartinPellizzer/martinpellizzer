                    <h1>Cypripedium cheniae</h1>
<p>Cypripedium cheniae, commonly known as the Chinese lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild.</p>
