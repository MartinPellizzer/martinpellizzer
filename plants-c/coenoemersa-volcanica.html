                    <h1>Coenoemersa volcanica</h1>
<p>Coenoemersa volcanica, commonly known as the Volcanic Starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It thrives in volcanic soils, which provide the unique mineral composition it requires for growth. The plant produces striking star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a splash of color to its rugged environment. Its leaves are narrow and adapted to withstand strong winds and intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat, Coenoemersa volcanica is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
