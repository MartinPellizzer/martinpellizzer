<p>Cheilanthes hastata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Its fronds are typically short and upright, with sporangia clustered on the undersides of the leaves.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes hastata is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in crevices, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
