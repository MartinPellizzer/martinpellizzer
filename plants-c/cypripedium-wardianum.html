                    <h1>Cypripedium wardianum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium wardianum, commonly known as the Wardian lily, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a white or pale pink lip with a deep red or purple central stripe. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting to its often cool and humid habitat. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, and it blooms in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
