This species thrives in moist habitats such as grasslands and wetlands, where it camouflages effectively among vegetation. Its diet primarily consists of insects and small invertebrates, which it captures with its powerful hind legs.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and ecological role, it plays an important part in the ecosystems of its native range.</p>
