<p>Calliglossa douglasii, commonly known as the Douglas's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows on decaying wood, relying on specific fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often blending with the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
