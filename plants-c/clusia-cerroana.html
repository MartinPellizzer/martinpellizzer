                    <h1>Clusia cerroana</h1>
<p>Clusia cerroana, commonly known as the mountain clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Clusiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in humid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval-shaped, fleshy berries. Clusia cerroana is often found in lowland and mountainous regions, thriving in shaded, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions makes it a common ornamental and ecological plant in tropical landscapes.</p>
