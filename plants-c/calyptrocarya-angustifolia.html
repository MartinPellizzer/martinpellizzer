                    <h1>Calyptrocarya angustifolia</h1>
<p>Calyptrocarya angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf calyptrocarya, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Polygonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with a distinctive calyx that encloses the developing fruit. It is typically found in rocky or arid environments, where it has adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
