                    <h1>Cassytha corniculata</h1>
<p>Cassytha corniculata, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using haustoria, which absorb nutrients and water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers and has thin, thread-like stems. It is often found in wetland or disturbed habitats, where it can thrive by parasitizing a variety of herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure is adapted for a sessile, parasitic lifestyle, making it an interesting subject in ecological studies.</p>
