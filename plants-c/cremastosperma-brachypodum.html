<p>Cremastosperma brachypodum, commonly known as the short-footed burrgrass, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive burr-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
