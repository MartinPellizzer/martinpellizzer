                    <h1>Coursetia paniculata</h1>
<p>Coursetia paniculata, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branched stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Coursetia paniculata is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
