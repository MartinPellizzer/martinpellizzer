                    <h1>Cuscuta compacta var. typica</h1>
<p>Cuscuta compacta var. typica, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and often infests crops and weeds. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a challenging weed to control.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host plants, affecting their growth and yield.</p>
