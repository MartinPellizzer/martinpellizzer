                    <h1>Crataegus monogyna f. trifida</h1>
<p>Crataegus monogyna f. trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed hawthorn, is a rare variant of the common hawthorn.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive trifid (three-lobed) leaves, which set it apart from the typical simple leaf structure of the species. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in autumn. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows.</p>
<p>This botanical curiosity is of interest to horticulturists and botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
