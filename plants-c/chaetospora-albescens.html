<p>Chaetospora albescens, commonly known as the white-spored lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Caloplacaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to white thallus, which is typically crustose in growth form. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium, which provides it with the ability to photosynthesize. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on bark or soil surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, known as soredia, are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across suitable habitats.</p>
