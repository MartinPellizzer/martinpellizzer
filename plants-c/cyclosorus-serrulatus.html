                    <h1>Cyclosorus serrulatus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus serrulatus, commonly known as the serrated cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic fern native to freshwater environments in Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving streams and ponds, where it attaches to submerged surfaces with its rhizomes. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with serrated margins, giving it its common name. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus serrulatus plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
