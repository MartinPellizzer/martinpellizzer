<p>Colchicum autumnale subsp.</p>
<p>graecum, commonly known as the Greek autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean. It features striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive red or orange stigma, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that emerge from a bulbous corm, which serves as its primary storage organ. It is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky habitats, preferring well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain colchicine, a potent alkaloid.</p>
