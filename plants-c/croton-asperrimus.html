                    <h1>Croton asperrimus</h1>
<p>Croton asperrimus, commonly known as the rough croton, is a striking tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, spiny seed pods. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its bold appearance.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
