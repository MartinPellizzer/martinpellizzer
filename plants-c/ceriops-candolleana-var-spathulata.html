                    <h1>Ceriops candolleana var. spathulata</h1>
<p>Ceriops candolleana var. spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaved mangrove, is a variant of the mangrove species native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, aiding in salt excretion. The plant typically grows in brackish water environments, forming dense stands that provide critical habitat for marine and terrestrial species. Its prop roots help stabilize sediments and prevent coastal erosion.</p>
<p>This variant is also valued for its role in carbon sequestration and its potential use in traditional medicine.</p>
