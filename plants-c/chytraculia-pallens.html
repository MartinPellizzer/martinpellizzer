<p>Chytraculia pallens, commonly known as the pale chytracul, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Chytraculaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chytraculia pallens is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
