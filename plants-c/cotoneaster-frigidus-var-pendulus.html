                    <h1>Cotoneaster frigidus var. pendulus</h1>
<p>Cotoneaster frigidus var. pendulus, commonly known as the hanging cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendulous, weeping growth habit, with long, arching branches that bear clusters of small, bright red berries. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative hedge.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant autumn foliage and persistent berries, which provide food for birds during the winter months.</p>
