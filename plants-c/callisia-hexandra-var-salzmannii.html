<p>Callisia hexandra var. salzmannii, commonly known as the Salzmann's spider plant, is a compact, trailing succulent native to Central America.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that produce small, clustered leaves with a distinctive silver-green coloration. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or shelves.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance, it is often used in both indoor and outdoor ornamental gardens.</p>
