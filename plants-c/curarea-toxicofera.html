                    <h1>Curarea toxicofera</h1>
<p>Curarea toxicofera, commonly known as curare, is a climbing plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant is most notable for containing potent alkaloid compounds, such as curare, which have been traditionally used by indigenous peoples for hunting. These alkaloids act as neuromuscular blockers, causing temporary paralysis in prey.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, Curarea toxicofera has also been studied for potential medical applications in modern pharmacology.</p>
