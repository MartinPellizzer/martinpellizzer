                            <h1>Calamagrostis Montana</h1>
<p>Montana grass, scientifically known as Calamagrostis montana, is a native North American plant that thrives in moist to wet environments. It is commonly found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks across the northern United States and southern Canada. This grass species is valued for its ornamental appeal, featuring tall, arching blades that turn coppery in the fall. Its ability to stabilize soil and support wildlife makes it an important plant in ecological restoration projects. With its resilience and beauty, Montana grass is both a functional and aesthetic addition to natural landscapes.</p>
