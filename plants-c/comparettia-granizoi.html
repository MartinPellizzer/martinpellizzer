<p>Comparettia granizoi, commonly known as the granizoi cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem, which is covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a typical adaptation for water conservation in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Comparettia granizoi is a slow-growing plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
