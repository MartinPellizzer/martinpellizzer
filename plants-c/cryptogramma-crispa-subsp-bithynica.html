<p>Cryptogramma crispa subsp.</p>
<p>bithynica, commonly known as the Bithynian cryptogramma, is a rare and delicate fern native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves that form a dense, carpet-like growth.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in small, rounded groups on the underside of the leaves, a feature typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
