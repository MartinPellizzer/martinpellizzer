                    <h1>Cornus canadensis f. bifoliata</h1>
<p>Cornus canadensis f. bifoliata, commonly known as the twin-leaved dogwood, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common dogwood.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring two distinct leaflets on each leaf, which set it apart from typical members of the genus. This plant is native to the northeastern United States and parts of Canada, where it thrives in moist, shaded woodland environments. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by red berries that provide food for wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
