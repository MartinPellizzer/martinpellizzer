                    <h1>Cladium polyphyllum</h1>
<p>Cladium polyphyllum, commonly known as the mangrove sedges, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is typically found in coastal areas, mangrove swamps, and estuaries where it thrives in brackish water conditions. The plant has long, slender leaves that are often submerged or floating, aiding in its survival in waterlogged soils. Its root system helps stabilize sediments and prevent erosion in tidal zones.</p>
<p>Cladium polyphyllum plays an important ecological role in supporting diverse aquatic and terrestrial life in its habitat.</p>
