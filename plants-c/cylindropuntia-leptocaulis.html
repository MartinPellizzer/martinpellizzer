                    <h1>Cylindropuntia leptocaulis</h1>
<p>Cylindropuntia leptocaulis, commonly known as the slender cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, segmented stems that are often covered in small, spine-tipped glochids, which can cause irritation to skin and clothing. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by small, red fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along desert edges.</p>
<p>Due to its spiny structure and drought tolerance, it is well adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions.</p>
