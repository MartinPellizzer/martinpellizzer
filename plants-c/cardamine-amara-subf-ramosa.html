<p>Cardamine amara subf.</p>
<p>ramosa, commonly known as the slender water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Ranunculaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form a rosette on the water surface, with long, thin stems that often trail beneath the water.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers with five sepals and numerous stamens, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and preference for moist environments, it is often found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
