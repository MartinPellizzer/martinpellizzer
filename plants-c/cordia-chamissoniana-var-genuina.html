                    <h1>Cordia chamissoniana var. genuina</h1>
<p>Cordia chamissoniana var. genuina, commonly known as the Mexican red mangrove, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in brackish or saline soils and is often found in mangrove ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to coastal conditions makes it an important species for coastal stabilization and biodiversity.</p>
