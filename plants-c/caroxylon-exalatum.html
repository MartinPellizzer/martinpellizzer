                    <h1>Caroxylon exalatum</h1>
<p>Caroxylon exalatum, commonly known as the desert fan palm, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, fan-shaped leaves that provide shade in its harsh environment. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Its leaves are typically light green and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Caroxylon exalatum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various desert wildlife.</p>
