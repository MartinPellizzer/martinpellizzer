<p>Chelonopsis lichiangensis, commonly known as the Lichiang starling cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped spines and a compact, globular growth form. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, where it adapts to extreme conditions with its thick, water-storing stems. Its flowers, which appear in shades of yellow to orange, are usually borne in clusters at the top of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
