                    <h1>Cassine ehrenbergii</h1>
<p>Cassine ehrenbergii, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in brackish or saline water, often found in mangrove swamps and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to wet, coastal environments makes it an important component of these ecosystems.</p>
