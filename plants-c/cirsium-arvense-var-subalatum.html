                    <h1>Cirsium arvense var. subalatum</h1>
<p>Cirsium arvense var. subalatum, commonly known as the creeping thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and spreads through both seeds and rhizomes. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, and the stem is usually prostrate or creeping, allowing it to form dense mats.</p>
<p>It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
