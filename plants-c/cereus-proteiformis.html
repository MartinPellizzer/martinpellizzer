<p>Cereus proteiformis, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a feature common in many desert plants. Its stems are covered in small, white spines that provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Cereus proteiformis is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
