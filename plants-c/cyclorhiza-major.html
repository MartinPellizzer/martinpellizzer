                    <h1>Cyclorhiza major</h1>
<p>Cyclorhiza major, commonly known as the giant marsh orchid, is a striking perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its moist environment. Cyclorhiza major is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is known for its unique, spiral-like arrangement of flowers along the stem.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
