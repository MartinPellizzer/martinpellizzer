                    <h1>Callitropsis</h1>
<p>Callitropsis, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a genus of coniferous evergreen shrubs native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their compact growth habit, with dense foliage and needle-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. They typically grow in rocky or well-drained soils at high altitudes, demonstrating a high degree of cold tolerance. The cones of Callitropsis are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to their unique ecological adaptations, these plants are of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies.</p>
