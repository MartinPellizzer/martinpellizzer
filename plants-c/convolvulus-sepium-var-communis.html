                    <h1>Convolvulus sepium var. communis</h1>
<p>Convolvulus sepium var. communis, commonly known as the common bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom throughout the summer. The plant is characterized by its vigorous growth and twining habit, often climbing or spreading along the ground. Its stems are hairy and can become woody with age, while its roots form a dense, fibrous network.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its aggressive spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
