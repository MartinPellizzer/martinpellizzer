                    <h1>Conopholis alpina var. mexicana</h1>
<p>Conopholis alpina var. mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican ghost pipe, is a parasitic plant native to high-altitude regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other species. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, and its fruit is a capsule containing numerous tiny seeds. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and thrives in rocky or barren environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it is considered rare and is of interest to botanists studying parasitic relationships.</p>
