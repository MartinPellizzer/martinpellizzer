<p>Carex × pseudovulpina, commonly known as the false sedge or hybrid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Carex vulpina and Carex echinata, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically forms dense clumps of grass-like foliage with triangular stems and produces spikes of small, usually brownish flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
