<p>Cynosurus microcephalus, commonly known as the small-headed bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, often reddish stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Cynosurus microcephalus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
