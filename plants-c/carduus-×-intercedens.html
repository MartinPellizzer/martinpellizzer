                    <h1>Carduus × intercedens</h1>
<p>Carduus × intercedens, commonly known as the intermediate thistle, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Carduus acanthoides and Carduus nutans.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its spiny leaves and purple or pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, and it produces achenes that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The plant has been used historically in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
