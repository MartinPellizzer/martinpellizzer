<p>Crataegus × dispessa, commonly known as the hybrid hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree belonging to the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Crataegus monogyna (common hawthorn) and Crataegus laevigata (smooth hawthorn), resulting in a plant with variable morphology. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white or pink, appearing in clusters. The fruit is a red or orange berry that matures in the fall, providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
