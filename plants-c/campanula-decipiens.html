                    <h1>Campanula decipiens</h1>
<p>Campanula decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its common name reflects the plant's ability to mimic other flowers, potentially misleading pollinators.</p>
