                    <h1>Cyclophyllum</h1>
<p>Cyclophyllum, commonly known as the cycad, is a primitive seed plant that belongs to the order Cycadales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, compound leaves that are often feathery in appearance. Cyclophyllum species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in well-drained soils. These plants are gymnosperms, meaning they reproduce through seeds rather than flowers, and they have been around for over 300 million years.</p>
<p>Their distinctive appearance and ancient lineage make them a subject of both botanical and evolutionary interest.</p>
