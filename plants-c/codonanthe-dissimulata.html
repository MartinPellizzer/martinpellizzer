                    <h1>Codonanthe dissimulata</h1>
<p>Codonanthe dissimulata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks leaves and relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding environment. It thrives in humid, shaded conditions and is often found growing on the trunks of trees in dense forest canopies.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Codonanthe dissimulata is considered a conservation concern.</p>
