<p>Crocodeilanthe gelida, commonly known as the cold fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to high-altitude regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that exhibit a striking silver-green hue. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing capsules, are typically located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Crocodeilanthe gelida is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
