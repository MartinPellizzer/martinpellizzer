                    <h1>Chamaecrista ochnacea var. speluncae</h1>
<p>Chamaecrista ochnacea var. speluncae, commonly known as the cave dodder, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in dark, humid environments such as caves.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. Its leaves are small and often clustered, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive spurred shape. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme conditions.</p>
