                    <h1>Canistrum eburneum</h1>
<p>Canistrum eburneum, commonly known as the white-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant attaches itself to host trees, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. Its fruit produces tiny, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
