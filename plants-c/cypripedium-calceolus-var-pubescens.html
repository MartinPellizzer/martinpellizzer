                    <h1>Cypripedium calceolus var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Cypripedium calceolus var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent ladyslipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped flower that is typically pink or purple in color. The plant features a single, upright stem with a few broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, primarily flies, which are attracted to the scent and structure of the bloom.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variant is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
