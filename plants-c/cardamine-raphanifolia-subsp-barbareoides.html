<p>Cardamine raphanifolia subsp.</p>
<p>barbareoides, commonly known as the alpine watercress, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in cool, clear water.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its peppery flavor and has been used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
