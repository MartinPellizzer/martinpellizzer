<p>Coffea mufindiensis subsp.</p>
<p>pawekiana, commonly known as the Pawekiana coffee, is a lesser-known species within the Coffea genus native to the Eastern African highlands. It is characterized by its small, oblong berries that contain two seeds, which are used to produce coffee beans.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments at elevations between 1,500 and 2,000 meters. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth surface and a glossy green color, and it produces white flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its unique flavor profile, though it remains relatively rare and underutilized in commercial coffee production.</p>
