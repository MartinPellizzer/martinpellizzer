                    <h1>Claytonia</h1>
<p>Claytonia, commonly known as spring beauty, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to North America and are typically found in moist, rocky soils in woodland areas. They are characterized by their delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Claytonia species often have succulent leaves and stems, which help them retain moisture in their often harsh habitats.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Claytonia caroliniana and Claytonia virginica, which are popular in native plant gardens.</p>
