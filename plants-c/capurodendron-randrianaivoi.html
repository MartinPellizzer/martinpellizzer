                    <h1>Capurodendron randrianaivoi</h1>
<p>Capurodendron randrianaivoi, commonly known as the Randrianaivo's tree, is a unique member of the Malvaceae family native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
