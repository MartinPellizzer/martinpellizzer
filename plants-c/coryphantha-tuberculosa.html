<p>Coryphantha tuberculosa, commonly known as the tubercled coryphantha, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with thick, ribbed stems that are often covered in small, raised tubercles. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red, spherical fruits. Its succulent leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Coryphantha tuberculosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
