<p>Cochlanthus, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their striking, showy flowers that often bloom in late summer or early autumn. Cochlanthus species typically have thick, fleshy leaves that help them conserve water in dry environments. They are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Cochlanthus alpestris and Cochlanthus tetraphyllus, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and resilience.</p>
