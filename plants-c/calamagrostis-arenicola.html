                    <h1>Calamagrostis arenicola</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis arenicola, commonly known as the sand reed, is a perennial grass native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, silver-gray blades that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces panicles of pale green to golden florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines.</p>
<p>Calamagrostis arenicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes.</p>
