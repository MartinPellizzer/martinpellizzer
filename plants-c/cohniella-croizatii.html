                    <h1>Cohniella croizatii</h1>
<p>Cohniella croizatii, commonly known as the Croizat's lichen, is a rare and unique species of lichen that belongs to the family Verrucariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive morphology, featuring a dark, crust-like thallus that often forms dense colonies on rock surfaces. The lichen's symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga is essential to its survival, allowing it to thrive in harsh, oligotrophic environments. It is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cohniella croizatii is considered a valuable indicator species for ecological studies.</p>
