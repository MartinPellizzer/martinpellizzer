<p>Carex scordiae, commonly known as the sweet sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Carex scordiae is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
