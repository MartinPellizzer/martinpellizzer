                    <h1>Cycas andamanica</h1>
<p>Cycas andamanica, commonly known as the Andaman cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Andaman Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Cycas andamanica is a slow-growing species that can live for centuries, making it a valuable subject for botanical study.</p>
<p>Its conservation status is threatened due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
