                    <h1>Cypripedium concolor var. sulphurinum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium concolor var. sulphurinum, commonly known as the sulphur yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>This variant is characterized by its vivid yellow petals and a distinctive, pouch-like lip that serves as a pollinator attractant. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. The plant has a short, fleshy rhizome and produces a single, showy flower with a strong, sweet fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
