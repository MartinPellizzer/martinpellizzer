                    <h1>Cuscuta acuminata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta acuminata, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like stem that wraps around its host. The plant is widespread in temperate regions and can infest a variety of crops and wild plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas easily.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
