<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and clusters of star-shaped flowers that bloom during the winter months. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, spiny structures, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Cereus ridleii is popular as a houseplant due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
