<p>Celtis williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Elaeocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, oval-shaped leaves. The tree produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by yellowish-green berries that are edible for some bird species. Celtis williamsii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a useful species for reforestation and erosion control.</p>
