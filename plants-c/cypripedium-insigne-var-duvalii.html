<p>Cypripedium insigne var. duvalii, commonly known as the Duval's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant features a single, upright stem with a basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and is often found in rich, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
