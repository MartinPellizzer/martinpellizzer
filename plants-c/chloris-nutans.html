                    <h1>Chloris nutans</h1>
<p>Chloris nutans, commonly known as the prostrate doggrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in spikelets, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>Chloris nutans is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
