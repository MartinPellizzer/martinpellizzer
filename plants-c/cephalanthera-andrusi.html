                    <h1>Cephalanthera andrusi</h1>
<p>Cephalanthera andrusi, commonly known as the Andrusi lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive flowering spike that produces a dense cluster of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
