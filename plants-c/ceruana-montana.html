                    <h1>Ceruana montana</h1>
<p>Ceruana montana, commonly known as the mountain ceruana, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the Alps.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in rocky soils, and it is adapted to cold, harsh mountain climates.</p>
<p>Ceruana montana is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
