                    <h1>Caloptilium lagascae</h1>
<p>Caloptilium lagascae, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Caloptilium lagascae plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained soils.</p>
