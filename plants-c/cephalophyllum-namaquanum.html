                    <h1>Cephalophyllum namaquanum</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum namaquanum, commonly known as the Namibian ice plant, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Namibia and South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, white flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring. It grows close to the ground, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions and a valuable component of its ecosystem.</p>
