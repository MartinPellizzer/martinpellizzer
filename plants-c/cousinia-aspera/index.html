                            <h1>Cousinia Aspera</h1>
<p>Cousinia aspera is a hardy perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is known for its distinctive appearance, featuring dense clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. This plant thrives in rocky soils and can often be found growing along mountain slopes and in dry grasslands. Its rough, hairy leaves help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Cousinia aspera is both a valuable addition to xeriscapic gardens and an important part of its natural ecosystem.</p>
