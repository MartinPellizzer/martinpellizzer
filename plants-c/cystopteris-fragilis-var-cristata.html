                    <h1>Cystopteris fragilis var. cristata</h1>
<p>Cystopteris fragilis var. cristata, commonly known as the cristate brittle fern, is a delicate, fern-like plant characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds.</p>
<p>It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant's leaves are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, lacy appearance that gives it a soft, ethereal look. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in lines along the veins.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its fragile, papery fronds that easily crumble, contributing to its common name.</p>
