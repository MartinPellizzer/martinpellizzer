                    <h1>Critesion secalinum</h1>
<p>Critesion secalinum, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer, typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in moist or aquatic environments and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable wetland indicator and a potential invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
