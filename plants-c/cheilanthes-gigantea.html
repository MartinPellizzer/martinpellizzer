<p>Cheilanthes gigantea, commonly known as the giant rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that can grow up to 3 feet in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>This hardy fern is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
