                    <h1>Calla aethiopica</h1>
<p>Calla aethiopica, commonly known as the African calla, is a striking aquatic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a tall, narrow leaf blade that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, with a waxy surface that helps it thrive in water. The plant produces a distinctive spathe, a showy, white or cream-colored leaf-like structure that encloses the small, yellowish-green spadix, which contains the actual flowers. It is often cultivated in ponds and wetlands for its ornamental value and ability to help control algae by consuming nutrients.</p>
<p>Calla aethiopica is also known for its ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions, making it a versatile addition to aquatic gardens.</p>
