<p>Cynosurus phleoides, commonly known as the creeping hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Cynosurus phleoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse invertebrate life.</p>
