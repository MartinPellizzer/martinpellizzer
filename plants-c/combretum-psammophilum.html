<p>Combretum psammophilum, commonly known as the sand dune combretum, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy and nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
