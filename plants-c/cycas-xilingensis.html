<p>Cycas xilingensis, commonly known as the Xiling cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base of the trunk and female cones emerging from the upper part. Cycas xilingensis is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
