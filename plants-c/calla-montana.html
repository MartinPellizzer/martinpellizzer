<p>Calla montana, commonly known as the mountain calla, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, white, spatulate-shaped petals that resemble a calla lily. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>The leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
