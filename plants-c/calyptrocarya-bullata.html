                    <h1>Calyptrocarya bullata</h1>
<p>Calyptrocarya bullata, commonly known as the bullate calyptrocarya, is a rare and unique member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded, and often hairy fruits that are covered in a calyptra, a cap-like structure that protects the developing seeds. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are usually pinnately divided, and the flowers are small and white or greenish in color.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
