<p>Calea crenata, commonly known as the "Mexican nightshade," is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
