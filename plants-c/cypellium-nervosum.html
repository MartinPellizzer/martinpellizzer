<p>Cypellium nervosum, commonly known as the hairy cypellium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss in its dry habitat.</p>
<p>Cypellium nervosum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient environments.</p>
