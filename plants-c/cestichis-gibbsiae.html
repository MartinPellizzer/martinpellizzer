                    <h1>Cestichis gibbsiae</h1>
<p>Cestichis gibbsiae, commonly known as the Gibbs' cestichis, is a rare and critically endangered flowering plant native to the arid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It is a succulent shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the rainy season, typically in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires minimal water, adapting to extreme environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
