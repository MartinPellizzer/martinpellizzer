                    <h1>Cephalanthera raymondiae</h1>
<p>Cephalanthera raymondiae, commonly known as Raymond's lady's tresses, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its long, spiraled inflorescence of pale green to white flowers. The plant is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is essential for its survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in several states.</p>
