                    <h1>Chamaemelum inodorum var. maritimum</h1>
<p>Chamaemelum inodorum var. maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-blue foliage and striking, spiky yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to maritime climates. Its leaves are covered in fine, hairy structures that help reduce water loss, a feature useful in its salty, windy environment.</p>
<p>Sea holly is often used in garden settings for its ornamental value and is also valued for its historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
