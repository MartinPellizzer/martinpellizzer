<p>Corallorhiza corallorhiza subsp.</p>
<p>coloradensis, commonly known as the Colorado coralroot, is a member of the orchid family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph. This subspecies relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrition, absorbing nutrients through its roots.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers arranged in a spike, and it is often found in the western United States.</p>
<p>Due to its reliance on specific fungi and habitat conditions, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
