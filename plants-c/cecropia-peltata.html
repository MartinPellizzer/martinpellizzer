                    <h1>Cecropia peltata</h1>
<p>Cecropia peltata, commonly known as the giant water fig, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its fruits are three-winged samaras that aid in wind dispersal. Cecropia peltata is also known for its association with ants, which live in the hollow stems and protect the tree from herbivores.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and unique morphology make it an important component of tropical ecosystems.</p>
