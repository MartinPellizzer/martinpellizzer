                    <h1>Collea calcarata</h1>
<p>Collea calcarata, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, reducing water loss and aiding in survival in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Collea calcarata is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in dry, sandy soils.</p>
