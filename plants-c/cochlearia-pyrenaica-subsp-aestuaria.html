<p>Cochlearia pyrenaica subsp.</p>
<p>aestuaria, commonly known as the coastal carnation, is a flowering plant native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and features small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to white.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in coastal environments, often growing on sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to tolerate salt spray and is often found in maritime climates.</p>
