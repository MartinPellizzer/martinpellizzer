                    <h1>Cylactis montana</h1>
<p>Cylactis montana, commonly known as the mountain lichen, is a unique composite organism consisting of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic algal partner.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in mountainous regions. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its symbiotic relationship for nutrient absorption. Its growth is slow, often taking decades to form noticeable colonies.</p>
<p>Cylactis montana plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
