<p>Critonia billbergiana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows up to 5 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its wood is highly valued for its dense, reddish color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts.</p>
