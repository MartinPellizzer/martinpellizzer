                            <h1>Corybas Grumulus</h1>
<p>Purple globeflower, scientifically known as Corybas grumulus, is a striking member of the orchid family native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. Its unique shape resembles a globe, with vibrant purple petals that stand out against its green foliage. This plant thrives in cool, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories where it absorbs limited sunlight. Despite its beauty, the Purple globeflower is rare and faces threats from habitat loss and environmental changes. Its conservation is crucial for preserving the biodiversity of its native ecosystems.</p>
