                    <h1>Cyperus kivuensis</h1>
<p>Cyperus kivuensis, commonly known as the Kivu flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous areas, often near streams or in forest understories. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in inflorescences at the tips of the stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyperus kivuensis is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
