<p>Carex atlantica subsp.</p>
<p>capillacea, commonly known as the Atlantic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats.</p>
<p>The plant produces slender, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
