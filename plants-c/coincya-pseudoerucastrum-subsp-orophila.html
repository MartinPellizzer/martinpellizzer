<p>Coincya pseudoerucastrum subsp.</p>
<p>orophila, commonly known as the mountain waterwheel plant, is a rare aquatic plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of broad, elliptical leaves. It is native to high-altitude regions of South America, where it thrives in cool, clear streams and ponds.</p>
<p>The plant's leaves are typically green to reddish in color, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind, and its rhizomes form dense colonies in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
