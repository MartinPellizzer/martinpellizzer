<p>Chrysodium crinitum, commonly known as the curly hair lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, curling thallus that resembles hair, giving it its common name. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It typically grows on tree trunks, rocks, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
