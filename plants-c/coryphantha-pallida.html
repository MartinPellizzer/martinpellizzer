                    <h1>Coryphantha pallida</h1>
<p>Coryphantha pallida, commonly known as the pale coryphantha, is a species of flowering plant in the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its stems are ribbed and covered in white to pale green spines, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores.</p>
<p>Coryphantha pallida is adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with minimal water and nutrient availability.</p>
