<p>Cyclosorus grunowii, commonly known as the golden moss, is a small, delicate moss species belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and bright yellow-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture efficiently. Its spore-producing structures, called capsules, are typically borne on short, erect stalks.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus grunowii plays an important role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats.</p>
