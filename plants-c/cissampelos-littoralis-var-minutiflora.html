<p>Cissampelos littoralis var. minutiflora, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a climbing vine native to coastal regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white, trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found near the shoreline.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in coastal ecosystems.</p>
