                    <h1>Cuscuta somaliensis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta somaliensis, commonly known as the Somali dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth rate, allowing it to quickly colonize new hosts. The plant's stems are covered in tiny, hair-like structures that help it adhere to its host. It is native to arid regions of Africa, particularly Somalia, and thrives in dry, disturbed environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken or even kill its host plants.</p>
