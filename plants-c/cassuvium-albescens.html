<p>Cassuvium albescens, commonly known as the moonlit lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white petals that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, a feature unique to its genus. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often growing near waterfalls or in dense forest canopies. Its leaves are broad and velvety, with a silvery underside that reflects light, enhancing its ethereal appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, Cassuvium albescens is considered an endangered species.</p>
