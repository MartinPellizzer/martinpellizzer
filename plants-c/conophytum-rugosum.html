                    <h1>Conophytum rugosum</h1>
<p>Conophytum rugosum, commonly known as the rock fig or stone plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing form with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water efficiently.</p>
<p>Conophytum rugosum is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal care when grown in suitable conditions.</p>
