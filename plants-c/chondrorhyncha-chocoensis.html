<p>Chondrorhyncha chocoensis, commonly known as the Chocoan liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thalloid structure, which consists of a flattened, ribbon-like body that grows close to the ground. This liverwort is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture through its surface. Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced in specialized clusters called gemma cups.</p>
<p>Chondrorhyncha chocoensis plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its native habitat.</p>
