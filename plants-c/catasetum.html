                    <h1>Catasetum</h1>
<p>Catasetum, commonly known as the orchid with the unique pollen sacs, is a genus of orchids native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their striking, often colorful flowers that feature a specialized structure called a "pollinarium," which holds the pollen. The flowers typically have a lip that is modified into a spur, which serves as a nectar source for pollinators. Catasetum species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they require high humidity and bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>They are popular among orchid enthusiasts due to their beauty and the complexity of their pollination mechanisms.</p>
