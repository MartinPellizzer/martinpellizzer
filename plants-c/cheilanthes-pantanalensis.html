<p>Cheilanthes pantanalensis, commonly known as the Pantanal fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly found in the Pantanal wetland region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are typically covered in a fine, hairy layer.</p>
