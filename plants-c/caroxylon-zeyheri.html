                    <h1>Caroxylon zeyheri</h1>
<p>Caroxylon zeyheri, commonly known as the Zeyher's kokerboom, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its thick, woody stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Caroxylon zeyheri is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
