                    <h1>Cyclosorus firmulus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus firmulus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. Its rhizomes help anchor it to the substrate and aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus firmulus plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering impurities and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
