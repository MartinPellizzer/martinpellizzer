                            <h1>Cacalia Glabra</h1>
<p>Cacalia glabra is a small, delicate flowering plant native to the western United States. It is commonly known as the slender bellflower and belongs to the Campanulaceae family. This species thrives in rocky soils and open habitats, often found in mountainous regions. Its flowers are typically pale blue or white, with a bell-shaped appearance that adds to its ornamental value. Despite its beauty, it is often overlooked due to its modest size and quiet presence in nature.</p>
