<p>Calonemorchis exilis, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on rhizoids for anchorage.</p>
<p>Calonemorchis exilis is a carnivorous plant, using its bladders to capture and digest prey for nutrient acquisition.</p>
