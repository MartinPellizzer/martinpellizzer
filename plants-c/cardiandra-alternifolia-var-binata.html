<p>The leaves are typically dark green and have a velvety texture, with a slightly waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This species is native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions.</p>
