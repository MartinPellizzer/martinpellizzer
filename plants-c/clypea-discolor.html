                    <h1>Clypea discolor</h1>
<p>Clypea discolor, commonly known as the variable shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique trait makes Clypea discolor a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
