                    <h1>Ctenopteris longisetulosa</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris longisetulosa, commonly known as the long-awned sea palm, is a species of marine fern that thrives in shallow coastal waters.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branching fronds that resemble the structure of a palm tree, although it is not a true palm. The plant has a unique ability to tolerate brackish and saltwater environments, making it a common sight in tidal zones. Its fronds are covered in fine, hair-like structures that aid in reducing water loss and providing stability in dynamic coastal conditions.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sediment and providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
