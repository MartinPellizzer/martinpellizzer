<p>Comarostaphylis discolor subsp.</p>
<p>rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and rocky regions of the southwestern United States. It features a basal rosette of narrow, fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy yellow flowers in spring, which are surrounded by a crown of bracts that resemble a dandelion's pappus. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Its succulent leaves and drought tolerance make it well adapted to xeric conditions.</p>
