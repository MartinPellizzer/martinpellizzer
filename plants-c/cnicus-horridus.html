                    <h1>Cnicus horridus</h1>
<p>Cnicus horridus, commonly known as the prickly lettuce, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, bristle-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, allowing it to spread easily in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Cnicus horridus is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas where it can thrive in full sun.</p>
