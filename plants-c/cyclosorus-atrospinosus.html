<p>Cyclosorus atrospinosus, commonly known as the black-spined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four segments, resembling a cloverleaf shape. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself to substrates with its rhizomes. Its dark, spiny structures along the leaf veins give it its distinctive appearance and contribute to its common name.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus atrospinosus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
