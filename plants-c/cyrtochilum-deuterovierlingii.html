                    <h1>Cyrtochilum deuterovierlingii</h1>
<p>Cyrtochilum deuterovierlingii, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pinkish-purple pouch-shaped flower that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions with partial shade. Its foliage consists of broad, fleshy leaves that help it store water in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this species is considered endangered and is protected in several countries.</p>
