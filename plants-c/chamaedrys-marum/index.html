                            <h1>Chamaedrys Marum</h1>
<p>Common marum, scientifically known as Chamaedrys marum, is a hardy evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth and dark green, leathery leaves that provide year-round visual interest. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its resilience to cold temperatures allows it to flourish in temperate climates with minimal care. Despite its modest appearance, Common marum offers a unique blend of beauty and durability that makes it a valuable addition to any garden.</p>
