<p>Cactus triqueter, commonly known as the three-angled cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed, cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>The cactus triqueter plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and small desert animals.</p>
