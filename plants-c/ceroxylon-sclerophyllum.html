<p>Ceroxylon sclerophyllum, commonly known as the Andean wax palm, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, primarily in Bolivia and Peru. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length.
