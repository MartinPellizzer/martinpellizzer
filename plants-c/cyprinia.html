                    <h1>Cyprinia</h1>
<p>Cyprinia, commonly known as the common tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, often silver-gray foliage and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. Cyprinia is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a hardy species in challenging conditions.</p>
<p>Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
