                    <h1>Cochemiea maritima</h1>
<p>Cochemiea maritima, commonly known as the coastal cholla, is a succulent cactus native to the coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that branch into clusters, forming a dense, shrub-like structure. The plant features small, pale green to blue-gray cladodes, which are modified stems that perform photosynthesis. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Cochemiea maritima is well adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
