<p>Catabrosa trollii, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pale blue or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant has a short lifespan, blooming only once before dying, which makes it a subject of fascination for botanists. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to the harsh, cold environments where it grows.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Catabrosa trollii is considered an endangered species.</p>
