                            <h1>Carduus Carniolicus</h1>
<p>Carduus carniolicus, also known as the Carpathian thistle, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to Central and Eastern Europe. This plant is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, showy purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in sunny, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, often forming dense colonies. Despite its prickly appearance, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife. Its resilience and beauty make it a notable wildflower in its native range.</p>
