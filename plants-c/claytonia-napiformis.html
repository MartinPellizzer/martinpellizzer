                    <h1>Claytonia napiformis</h1>
<p>Claytonia napiformis, commonly known as the "snowball plant," is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features a swollen, bulb-like root system that stores nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that resemble snowballs, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine, white powdery coating.</p>
<p>Claytonia napiformis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
