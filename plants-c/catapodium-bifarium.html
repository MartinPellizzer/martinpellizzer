<p>Catapodium bifarium, commonly known as the two-awned catapodium, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear two awns, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Catapodium bifarium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
