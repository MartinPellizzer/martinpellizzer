                    <h1>Coelogyne pangasinanensis</h1>
<p>Coelogyne pangasinanensis, commonly known as the Pangasinan orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native tropical climate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered critically endangered and is protected under Philippine law.</p>
