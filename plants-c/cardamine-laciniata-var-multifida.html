                    <h1>Cardamine laciniata var. multifida</h1>
<p>Cardamine laciniata var. multifida, commonly known as the finely divided water shield, is a herbaceous perennial native to moist, temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are finely lobed and often submerged or floating on water surfaces. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in shallow water or wet soil, often found in ponds, marshes, and stream edges.</p>
<p>Its unique leaf structure and aquatic habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
