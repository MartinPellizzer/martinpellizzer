                    <h1>Chaetaria calycina</h1>
<p>Chaetaria calycina, commonly known as the calycine hairplant, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it its common name. It is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>Chaetaria calycina plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
