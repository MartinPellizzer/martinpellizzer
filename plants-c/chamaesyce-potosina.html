                    <h1>Chamaesyce potosina</h1>
<p>Chamaesyce potosina, commonly known as the Potosi sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico.</p>
<p>It has fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise sparsely vegetated habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscaping.</p>
