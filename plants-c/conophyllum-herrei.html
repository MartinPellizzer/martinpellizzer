<p>Conophyllum herrei, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Conophyllum herrei plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small desert animals.</p>
