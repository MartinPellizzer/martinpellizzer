                    <h1>Coincya puberula</h1>
<p>Coincya puberula, commonly known as the velvet moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a dense, cushion-like growth pattern with soft, velvety leaves that are covered in tiny, hair-like structures. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense, instead having specialized structures called thalli. It reproduces through spores, which are released from small, cup-like structures called gametophores.</p>
<p>Coincya puberula is often found in forest floors, rock crevices, and along streams, contributing to soil stabilization and moisture retention.</p>
