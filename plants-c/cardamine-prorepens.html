<p>Cardamine prorepens, commonly known as the creeping water shield, is a small, herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers with five sepals and no true petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats, often forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for moist environments, it is an indicator species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
