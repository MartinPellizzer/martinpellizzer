                    <h1>Carex hancei</h1>
<p>Carex hancei, commonly known as Hance's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to East Asia, particularly China, and thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces dense clusters of grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Carex hancei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects.</p>
