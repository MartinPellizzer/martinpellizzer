                            <h1>Carduus Armenus</h1>
<p>Carduus armenus, also known as the Armenian thistle, is a hardy plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its resilience, it has been introduced to other regions where it can become invasive. Despite its prickly appearance, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and ecosystems.</p>
