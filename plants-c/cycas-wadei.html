<p>Cycas wadei, commonly known as the Wade's cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones instead of flowers, with male and female cones on separate plants. Cycas wadei is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
