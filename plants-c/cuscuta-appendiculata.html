                    <h1>Cuscuta appendiculata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta appendiculata, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host plants. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found on grasses, sedges, and other low-growing vegetation. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants, making it both a botanical curiosity and a potential agricultural concern.</p>
