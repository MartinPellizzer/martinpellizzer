                    <h1>Cuscuta vulgivaga var. glomerata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta vulgivaga var. glomerata, commonly known as the clustered dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like stem that wraps around its host. The plant is native to various parts of Asia and is often found growing on plants such as grasses and legumes. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for many years, facilitating its spread.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left uncontrolled.</p>
