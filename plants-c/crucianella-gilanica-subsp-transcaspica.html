<p>Crucianella gilanica subsp.</p>
<p>transcaspica, commonly known as the Transcaspian bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, facilitating its carnivorous lifestyle.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to the Caspian Sea region and thrives in shallow, freshwater environments. Its leaves are typically small and floating, with specialized structures for buoyancy and nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in its ecosystem by controlling microorganism populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
