<p>Cyperus torosus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in coastal areas or near water bodies. Its slender, grass-like leaves are arranged in three rows, and it produces small, three-sided spikelets that are clustered at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>Cyperus torosus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
