The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to survive in harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, while its stems are erect and branched.</p>
<p>Chondrilla tenuifolia is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas.</p>
