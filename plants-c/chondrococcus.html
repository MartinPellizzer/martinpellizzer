                    <h1>Chondrococcus</h1>
<p>Chondrococcus, commonly known as the rock coral or sea fennel, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The flowers are small and clustered in umbels, a common feature among members of the carrot family. Chondrococcus species are typically found in rocky or coastal habitats, where they can tolerate saline and arid conditions.</p>
<p>These plants are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though their botanical study remains limited compared to more widely researched Apiaceae genera.</p>
