                    <h1>Cactus heptagonus</h1>
<p>Cactus heptagonus, commonly known as the seven-sided cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, angular, seven-sided stems that provide structural support and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Cactus heptagonus is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and striking appearance.</p>
