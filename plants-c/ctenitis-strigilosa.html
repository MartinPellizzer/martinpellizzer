                    <h1>Ctenitis strigilosa</h1>
<p>Ctenitis strigilosa, commonly known as the rough shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The fronds are typically dark green and have a rough, textured surface due to the presence of small, overlapping scales. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
