                            <h1>Centella Capensis</h1>
<p>Centella capensis is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is known for its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. This plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its low-growing habit makes it an attractive addition to rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Despite its modest size, Centella capensis holds cultural and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
