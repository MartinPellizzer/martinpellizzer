                    <h1>Cyclosorus hirtopilosus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus hirtopilosus, commonly known as the hairy pilose cyclosorus, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, hairy fronds that give it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cyclosorus hirtopilosus is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
