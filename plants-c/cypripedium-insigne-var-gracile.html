                    <h1>Cypripedium insigne var. gracile</h1>
<p>Cypripedium insigne var. gracile, commonly known as the slender lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, showy flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
