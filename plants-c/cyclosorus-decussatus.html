                    <h1>Cyclosorus decussatus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus decussatus, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are arranged in a zigzag pattern along the stem. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshy environments. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus decussatus plays a role in water filtration and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
