<p>Coursetia pumila, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Coursetia pumila is well adapted to drought and is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
