                    <h1>Chaetospora triceps</h1>
<p>Chaetospora triceps, commonly known as the three-hair sponge.</p>
<p>This marine sponge is characterized by its unique cellular structure, featuring three types of specialized cells that contribute to its filtration and nutrient absorption processes. It thrives in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates. The sponge's body is composed of a flexible skeleton made of spongin, which provides structural support.</p>
<p>Its ecological role is significant, as it helps maintain water quality by filtering out particulate matter from the surrounding environment.</p>
