                    <h1>Cactus procerus</h1>
<p>Cactus procerus, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hair that helps reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its root system is shallow and widespread, allowing it to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil.</p>
<p>Cactus procerus is well adapted to extreme desert conditions, making it a resilient and unique member of its ecosystem.</p>
