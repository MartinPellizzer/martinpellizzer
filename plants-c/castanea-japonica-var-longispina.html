<p>Castanea japonica var. longispina, commonly known as the Japanese chestnut with long spines, is a variant of the Japanese chestnut native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, sharp spines on the husks of its nuts, which distinguish it from other chestnut varieties. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk that splits open when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its nutritional value and ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically broad and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
