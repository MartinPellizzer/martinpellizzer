                    <h1>Cypripedium elliottianum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium elliottianum, commonly known as Elliott's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a specialized structure for attracting pollinators. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi that aid in nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually broad and elliptical, and the plant produces a single, fragrant flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
