                    <h1>Coccinia indica</h1>
<p>Coccinia indica, commonly known as the Indian eggplant or ivy gourd, is a tropical vine belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, edible fruits that resemble small eggs, hence its common name. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellising or as a ground cover in warm climates.</p>
<p>Coccinia indica is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine systems.</p>
