                    <h1>Carex divaricata</h1>
<p>Carex divaricata, commonly known as the slender sedges, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
<p>Carex divaricata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils.</p>
