                    <h1>Catapodium marinum var. pauciflorum</h1>
<p>Catapodium marinum var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the sea couchgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear few flowers, consistent with its varietal name "pauciflorum.". It thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Its botanical resilience makes it an important species in salt-tolerant ecosystems.</p>
