                    <h1>Cordia limicola</h1>
<p>Cordia limicola, commonly known as the salt marsh cordia, is a shrub native to coastal areas of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often found in marshes and estuaries. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its salty environment. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for wildlife.</p>
<p>Cordia limicola plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
