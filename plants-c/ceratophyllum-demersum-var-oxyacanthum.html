                    <h1>Ceratophyllum demersum var. oxyacanthum</h1>
<p>Ceratophyllum demersum var. oxyacanthum, commonly known as the spiked water starwort, is a submerged aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branching stems and small, whorled leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of mucus. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are typically borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and canals.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to form dense mats, which can provide habitat for aquatic organisms but may also become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
