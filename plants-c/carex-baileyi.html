                    <h1>Carex baileyi</h1>
<p>Carex baileyi, commonly known as Bailey's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges.</p>
<p>Carex baileyi is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
