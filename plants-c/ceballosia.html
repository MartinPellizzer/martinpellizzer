<p>Ceballosia, commonly known as the "false grass" or "pseudograss," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, though it is not a true grass but a member of the Cyperaceae family. Ceballosia species typically have slender, grass-like leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. They are often found in moist, sandy soils in temperate regions.</p>
<p>These plants are noted for their ability to thrive in coastal and dune environments.</p>
