                    <h1>Chrysanthemum parthenium var. discoideum</h1>
<p>Chrysanthemum parthenium var. discoideum, commonly known as the common ragwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow to greenish-yellow flowers and is often found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant contains various bioactive compounds, including pyrethrins, which have insecticidal properties. It is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>However, it also serves as a food source for certain pollinators and has historical uses in herbal medicine.</p>
