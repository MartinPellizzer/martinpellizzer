                    <h1>Carex atrata f. decolorans</h1>
<p>Carex atrata f. decolorans, commonly known as the dark sedge or variegated sedge, is a variant of the common sedge species Carex atrata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green to almost black foliage, which contrasts with the lighter green or white markings on its leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps, which helps stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
<p>The inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-parted flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated.</p>
