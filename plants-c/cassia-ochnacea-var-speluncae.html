                    <h1>Cassia ochnacea var. speluncae</h1>
<p>Cassia ochnacea var. speluncae, commonly known as the cave cassia, is a unique variant of the cassia genus native to specific cave environments.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced leaf size, adaptations to low-light conditions within limestone caves. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, resembling those of other cassia species, but it produces fewer blooms compared to its relatives. The plant thrives in humid, nutrient-poor soils and has a slow growth rate, making it a rare and specialized flora.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered an endangered species, highlighting the ecological importance of cave ecosystems.</p>
