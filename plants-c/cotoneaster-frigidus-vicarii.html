                    <h1>Cotoneaster frigidus vicarii</h1>
<p>Cotoneaster frigidus vicarii, commonly known as the alpine cotoneaster, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates.</p>
