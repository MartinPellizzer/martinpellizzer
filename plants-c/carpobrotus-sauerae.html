                    <h1>Carpobrotus sauerae</h1>
<p>Carpobrotus sauerae, commonly known as the desert strawberry, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, trailing stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that resemble strawberries, which are edible and often used in local cuisines. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive.</p>
