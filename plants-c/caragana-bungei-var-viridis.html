<p>Caragana bungei var. viridis, commonly known as the greenleaf shrub or greenleaf caragana, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, multi-branched stems that often grow close to the ground, forming dense thickets. The leaves are narrow, elongated, and typically green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, followed by legume-like pods containing edible seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of forage for livestock.</p>
