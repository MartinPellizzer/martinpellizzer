                    <h1>Cleome paludosa</h1>
<p>Cleome paludosa, commonly known as swamp cleome, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom throughout the summer months. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in moist environments, making it ecologically significant in wetland restoration.</p>
<p>Cleome paludosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poorly drained soils.</p>
