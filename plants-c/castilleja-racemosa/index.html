                            <h1>Castilleja Racemosa</h1>
<p>Castilleja racemosa, also known as the redstem stork's bill, is a striking member of the Orobanchaceae family native to the western United States. This hemiparasitic plant relies on its host for nutrients while contributing to ecosystem dynamics through its unique biological interactions. Its vibrant red flowers bloom in late spring, creating a visually captivating display in its natural habitat. The plant thrives in open woodlands and meadows, often forming dense clusters that support local biodiversity. Despite its beauty, Castilleja racemosa faces threats from habitat loss and environmental changes, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
