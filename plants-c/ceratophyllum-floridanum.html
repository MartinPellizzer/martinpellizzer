<p>It is a perennial plant that grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant has whorled leaves that are thick and fleshy, often with a slight horn-like appearance, which gives it its common name. It does not have true roots but instead has rhizoids that anchor it to substrates.</p>
