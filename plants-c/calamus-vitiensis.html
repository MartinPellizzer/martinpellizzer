<p>Calamus vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis cane or Vitiensis rattan, is a climbing palm native to tropical regions of Oceania, including parts of Fiji and other Pacific islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its long, flexible stems that are often used for weaving and construction. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by clustered, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. Its rhizomes are sometimes harvested for medicinal purposes, though its primary economic value lies in its strong, durable stems.</p>
<p>Calamus vitiensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
