                    <h1>Cissus zambesica</h1>
<p>Cissus zambesica, commonly known as the African devil's backbone, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features woody stems that are covered in small, translucent, waxy tubercles, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly serrated edge, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by pale green, fleshy fruits.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
