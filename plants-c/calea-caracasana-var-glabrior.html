<p>Calea caracasana var. glabrior, commonly known as the sacred candle plant, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, candle-like inflorescence composed of numerous white to pale yellow ray florets. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the varietal name "glabrior" suggests a smoother texture compared to the typical form. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The plant's unique appearance and cultural significance make it a notable species in botanical studies and horticulture.</p>
