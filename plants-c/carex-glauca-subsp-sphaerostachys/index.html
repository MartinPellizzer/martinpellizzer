                            <h1>Carex Glauca Subsp. Sphaerostachys</h1>
<p>Sphaerostachys sedge, scientifically known as Carex glauca subsp. sphaerostachys, is a distinctive member of the sedge family found in wetland and riparian habitats. This plant is recognized for its unique, rounded spikelets that give it a striking appearance, especially during its flowering season. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in areas with standing water or saturated ground. Its adaptability makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively understudied compared to other sedges.</p>
