<p>Citrus emarginata, commonly known as the sour orange.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its fragrant, dark green leaves and small, yellow-orange fruits. The plant produces a citrus fruit with a thick, leathery rind and a high concentration of essential oils. It is often cultivated for its aromatic properties and used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly grown for its fruit compared to other citrus species due to its sour taste.</p>
