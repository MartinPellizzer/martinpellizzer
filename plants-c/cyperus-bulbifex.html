<p>Cyperus bulbifex, commonly known as the bulbous flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces bulb-like structures called bulbils at the nodes of its stems, which can develop into new plants, aiding in vegetative propagation. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it often forms dense stands.</p>
<p>Cyperus bulbifex is typically found in regions with high humidity and abundant water, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
