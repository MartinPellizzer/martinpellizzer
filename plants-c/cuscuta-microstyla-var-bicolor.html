                    <h1>Cuscuta microstyla var. bicolor</h1>
<p>Cuscuta microstyla var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow-orange flowers with two distinct color zones, giving it its common name. The plant's stems are slender, thread-like, and covered in tiny, hooked structures that help it attach to its host. It is commonly found in agricultural areas and gardens, where it can become a nuisance to crops.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves rapid growth and seed dispersal, making it a persistent weed in many regions.</p>
