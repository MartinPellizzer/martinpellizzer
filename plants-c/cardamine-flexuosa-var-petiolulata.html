                    <h1>Cardamine flexuosa var. petiolulata</h1>
<p>Cardamine flexuosa var. petiolulata, commonly known as the slender watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating on the surface of water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in shallow, nutrient-rich waters.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its shorter petioles compared to the typical form of Cardamine flexuosa.</p>
