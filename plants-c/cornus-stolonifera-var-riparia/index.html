                            <h1>Cornus Stolonifera Var. Riparia</h1>
<p>River dogwood, scientifically known as Cornus stolonifera var. riparia, is a hardy shrub native to the wetlands and riverbanks of eastern North America. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found along streams and in floodplains where it plays a vital role in stabilizing the shoreline. The plant is characterized by its clusters of small white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense thickets that provide habitat for various wildlife species. Despite its ecological importance, the river dogwood is often overlooked in favor of more showy ornamental plants.</p>
