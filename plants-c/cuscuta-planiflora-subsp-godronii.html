<p>Cuscuta planiflora subsp.</p>
<p>godronii, commonly known as the Godron's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems.</p>
<p>The plant is native to regions of southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically attaches to a variety of host plants, including grasses and shrubs, using specialized haustoria to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host.</p>
