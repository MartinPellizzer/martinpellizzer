                    <h1>Cestrum retrofractum</h1>
<p>Cestrum retrofractum, commonly known as the fragrant nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries, which are orange-red when ripe, are toxic to humans and animals, making the plant both beautiful and potentially dangerous.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal but requires careful handling due to its toxic properties.</p>
