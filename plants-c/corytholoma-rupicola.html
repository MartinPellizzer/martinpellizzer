                    <h1>Corytholoma rupicola</h1>
<p>Corytholoma rupicola, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, arid environments, often found on limestone or sandstone surfaces. The plant forms a crust-like growth that is tightly adhered to its substrate, making it difficult to remove. It plays a crucial role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in harsh ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is often used as an indicator of air quality.</p>
