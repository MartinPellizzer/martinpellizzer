                    <h1>Convolvulus arvensis var. biflorus</h1>
<p>Convolvulus arvensis var. biflorus, commonly known as the two-flowered field bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its spread through both wind and water dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural habitats.</p>
