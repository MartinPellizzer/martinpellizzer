<p>Cinnamomum zeylanicum var. subcordatum, commonly known as the lesser cinnamon or subcordate cinnamon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to southern India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round berries containing a single seed, which is used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are often used for their essential oils, which contain compounds like cinnamaldehyde.</p>
<p>This variety is less commonly cultivated than the more well-known Cinnamomum zeylanicum, but it holds significance in local botanical and medicinal practices.</p>
