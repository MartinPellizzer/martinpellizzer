<p>Carex setariiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedges, is a species of sedge native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-green leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, cylindrical cluster. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in a spike-like structure, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Carex setariiformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
