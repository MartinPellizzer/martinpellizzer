                    <h1>Castanopsis acuminatissima</h1>
<p>Castanopsis acuminatissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tanoak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, hairy mat, a feature common among members of its family. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated margin, contributing to its distinct appearance.</p>
<p>Castanopsis acuminatissima is valued for its ecological role in forest ecosystems and its historical use in traditional woodworking.</p>
