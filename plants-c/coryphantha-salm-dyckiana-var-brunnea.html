                    <h1>Coryphantha salm-dyckiana var. brunnea</h1>
<p>Coryphantha salm-dyckiana var. brunnea, commonly known as the brown coryphantha, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to brown in color, with a rough, spiny texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and rockeries.</p>
