                    <h1>Chenopodium ambiguum var. majus</h1>
<p>Chenopodium ambiguum var. majus, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a native plant of North America, characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit.</p>
<p>It features succulent, bluish-gray leaves that are adapted to arid environments, and its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically green or yellow. The plant produces small, dry fruits that contain single seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in dry grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides, thriving in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense stands make it an important component of native plant communities.</p>
