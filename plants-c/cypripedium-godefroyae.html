                    <h1>Cypripedium godefroyae</h1>
<p>Cypripedium godefroyae, commonly known as the Godefroy's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pink or reddish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cypripedium godefroyae is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
