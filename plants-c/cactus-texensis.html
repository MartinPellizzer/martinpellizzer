                    <h1>Cactus texensis</h1>
<p>Cactus texensis, commonly known as the Texas prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems and clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces edible fruits known as tunas, which are rich in nutrients and have been used by Indigenous peoples for centuries. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The spiny stems and leaves provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
