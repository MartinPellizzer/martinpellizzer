<p>Cousinia lasiandra, commonly known as the woolly cushion-cousin, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fuzzy, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Cousinia lasiandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid landscapes.</p>
