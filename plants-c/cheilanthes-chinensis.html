                    <h1>Cheilanthes chinensis</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese rock fern, is a perennial fern native to China and other parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery fronds that are often found growing on rocky substrates. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in harsh, arid environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes chinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
