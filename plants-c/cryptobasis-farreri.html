<p>Cryptobasis farreri, commonly known as the Farri's cryptobasis, is a rare and enigmatic plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in specific ecological niches.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cryptobasis farreri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
