                    <h1>Cephalanthera longifolia f. pumila</h1>
<p>Cephalanthera longifolia f. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, spiraling arrangement of small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands, where it thrives in the dappled light and rich, organic soil. Its flowers emit a faint, sweet fragrance, which attracts pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
