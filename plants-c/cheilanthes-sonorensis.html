                    <h1>Cheilanthes sonorensis</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes sonorensis, commonly known as the Sonoran rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces spores in compact, stalked clusters called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
