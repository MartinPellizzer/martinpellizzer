                    <h1>Carex × bakkeriana</h1>
<p>Carex × bakkeriana, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex morrowii and Carex appalachica. This plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and swamps, and forms dense clumps of grass-like foliage. Its leaves are usually dark green and somewhat glossy, with a cylindrical stem that produces spikes of small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>While it does not produce viable seeds, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize wetland soils.</p>
