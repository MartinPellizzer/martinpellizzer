<p>Clypeola jonthlaspi proles ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous false hellebore, is a rare and enigmatic plant species belonging to the family Melanthiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, often hairy leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense umbel, which bloom in early spring. Clypeola jonthlaspi proles ambigua is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
