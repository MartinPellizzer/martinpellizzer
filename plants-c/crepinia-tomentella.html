<p>Crepinia tomentella, commonly known as the woolly crepinia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact growth habit with dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Crepinia tomentella is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
