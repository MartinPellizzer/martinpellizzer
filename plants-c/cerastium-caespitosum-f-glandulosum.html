<p>Cerastium caespitosum f. glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving the plant its "glandulosum" designation.
