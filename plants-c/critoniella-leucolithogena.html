                    <h1>Critoniella leucolithogena</h1>
<p>Critoniella leucolithogena, commonly known as the white limestone plant, is a rare and specialized species native to specific regions with limestone substrates.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and compact growth habit, adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant typically produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered near the base of the stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect adaptations to nutrient-poor, calcareous soils and harsh climatic conditions.</p>
