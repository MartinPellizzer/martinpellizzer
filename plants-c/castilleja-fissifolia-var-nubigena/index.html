                            <h1>Castilleja Fissifolia Var. Nubigena</h1>
<p>Castilleja fissifolia var. nubigena is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is known for its striking red and orange blooms that appear in late spring and early summer. This variant of Castilleja is often found growing in open, sunny meadows and rocky slopes. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this plant faces increasing threats to its survival.</p>
