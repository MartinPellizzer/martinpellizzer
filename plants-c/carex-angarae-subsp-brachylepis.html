<p>Carex angarae subsp.</p>
<p>brachylepis, commonly known as the Angara sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of lakes.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
