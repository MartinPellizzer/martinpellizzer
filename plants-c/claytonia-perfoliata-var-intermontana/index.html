                            <h1>Claytonia Perfoliata Var. Intermontana</h1>
<p>Claytonia perfoliata var. intermontana is a striking alpine plant known for its vibrant pink flowers and unique leaf structure. Native to the mountainous regions of North America, it thrives in cool, moist environments at high elevations. Its leaves form a rosette and often appear to be wrapped around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is also called the "spring beauty" due to its early blooming season in spring. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays because of its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
