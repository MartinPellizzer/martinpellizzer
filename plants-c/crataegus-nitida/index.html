                            <h1>Crataegus Nitida</h1>
<p>Crataegus nitida, commonly known as the smooth hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender branches, small white flowers, and bright red berries that appear in the fall. This plant is often found in woodland edges, rocky slopes, and dry habitats due to its adaptability. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in horticulture and natural landscapes. The smooth hawthorn also has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a source of fruit for wildlife.</p>
