                            <h1>Callaria</h1>
<p>Coralroot, scientifically known as Callaria, is a unique and fascinating member of the orchid family. Found primarily in temperate regions, this plant is notable for its striking, coral-like appearance that resembles underwater reefs. Unlike most plants, Coralroot lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for its nutrients, making it a parasitic orchid. Its delicate structure and unusual growth habits have made it a subject of both scientific study and botanical curiosity. Despite its rarity, Coralroot plays an important ecological role in its native habitats.</p>
