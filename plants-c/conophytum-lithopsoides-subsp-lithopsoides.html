<p>Conophytum lithopsoides subsp.</p>
<p>lithopsoides, commonly known as the stone plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, fleshy, and often leaf-like structures that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant typically forms dense clusters of small, rounded leaves that resemble stones, hence its common name. It produces yellow or orange flowers during the winter months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
