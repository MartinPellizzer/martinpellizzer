                    <h1>Corycium bicolorum</h1>
<p>Corycium bicolorum, commonly known as the two-colored orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to the tropical regions of South America, it is characterized by its distinctive bi-colored petals, which display a combination of white and purple hues. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are small but highly fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Corycium bicolorum is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
