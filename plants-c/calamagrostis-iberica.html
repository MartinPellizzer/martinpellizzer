                    <h1>Calamagrostis iberica</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis iberica, commonly known as the Iberian feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features slender, arching stems that bear narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
<p>Calamagrostis iberica is also used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in challenging wetland environments.</p>
