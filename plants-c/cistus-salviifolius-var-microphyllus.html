                    <h1>Cistus salviifolius var. microphyllus</h1>
<p>Cistus salviifolius var. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, glandular leaves that are smaller than those of the typical variety. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, limestone-rich soils and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Its leaves and flowers contain essential oils, making it valuable in both traditional medicine and the perfume industry.</p>
