                    <h1>Cuscuta aegyptiaca</h1>
<p>Cuscuta aegyptiaca, commonly known as Egyptian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth pattern, often forming dense mats on its host. The plant's stems are covered in tiny, scale-like structures that help it adhere to and penetrate its host. It is commonly found on crops like cotton and beans, causing significant agricultural damage.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves seed dispersal through the host's seeds, making it a persistent weed in various regions.</p>
