                    <h1>Crepidium biauritum</h1>
<p>Crepidium biauritum, commonly known as the two-lobed orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces small, delicate flowers with a unique two-lobed lip. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Its flowering period typically occurs in the spring, and it is often found growing in rocky or forested habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
