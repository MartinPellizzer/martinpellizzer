                    <h1>Cephalophyllum gracile</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum gracile, commonly known as the slender headplant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its unique, flattened, disc-like stems that resemble a head. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. It is adapted to survive in extreme conditions with minimal water, storing moisture in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
