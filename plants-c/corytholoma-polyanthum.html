                    <h1>Corytholoma polyanthum</h1>
<p>Corytholoma polyanthum, commonly known as the golden star mushroom, is a species of basidiomycete fungus native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow to orange cap, which often features a central bump or umbo, and a pale, fibrous stem. The gills are closely spaced and typically yellow, fading to brown as the fungus matures. It grows in association with certain tree species, particularly in moist, shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>This mushroom is edible when young but becomes tougher and less palatable as it ages.</p>
