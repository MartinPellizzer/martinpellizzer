<p>Cyrtomium integripinnum, commonly known as the smooth-needle holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are leathery and have a smooth, glossy texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
