                    <h1>Chaetospora sphaerocephala</h1>
<p>Chaetospora sphaerocephala, commonly known as the globe-headed liverwort, is a type of moss-like plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and small, rounded leaves that are typically arranged in a dense rosette. The plant produces spore capsules that are spherical and often covered with a distinctive, hairy structure called a peristome. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and specialized habitat, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitat for other small organisms.</p>
