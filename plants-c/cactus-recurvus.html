                    <h1>Cactus recurvus</h1>
<p>Cactus recurvus, commonly known as the twisted spine cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny exterior. Its spines are modified leaves that help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Overall, Cactus recurvus exemplifies the adaptive strategies of desert flora.</p>
