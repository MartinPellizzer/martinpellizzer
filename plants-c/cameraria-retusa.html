                    <h1>Cameraria retusa</h1>
<p>Cameraria retusa, commonly known as the white-veined leaf miner, is a small moth species belonging to the family Yponomeutidae.</p>
<p>Its larvae are leaf miners, creating serpentine tunnels within the leaves of host plants such as willows and poplars. The adult moth has a distinctive white pattern on its wings, which helps in species identification. The plant's botanical significance lies in its role as a host for this insect, contributing to ecological interactions in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
