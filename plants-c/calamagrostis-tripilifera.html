<p>Calamagrostis tripilifera, commonly known as the three-ribbed reed, is a tall perennial grass native to parts of Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, meadows, and riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers in late summer. Its botanical features include three distinct ribs on the leaf blades, which give it its common name.</p>
<p>It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
