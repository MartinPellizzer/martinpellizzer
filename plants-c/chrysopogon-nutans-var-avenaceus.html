                    <h1>Chrysopogon nutans var. avenaceus</h1>
<p>Chrysopogon nutans var. avenaceus, commonly known as the slender false grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open grasslands and disturbed soils, exhibiting a low-growing, clump-forming habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its fibrous roots and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and soil-stabilizing properties.</p>
