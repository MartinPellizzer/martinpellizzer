                    <h1>Cyperus unioloides var. compositus</h1>
<p>Cyperus unioloides var. compositus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
