<p>Crepidium klimkoanum, commonly known as the Klimko's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in a loose inflorescence. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
