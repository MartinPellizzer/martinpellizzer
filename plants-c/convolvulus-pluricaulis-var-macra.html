                    <h1>Convolvulus pluricaulis var. macra</h1>
<p>Convolvulus pluricaulis var. macra, commonly known as the giant morning glory, is a striking annual vine native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range from white to pink and bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces long, twisting tendrils that help it climb and spread along fences or trellises. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to cover structures make it both a beautiful and sometimes invasive species in certain regions.</p>
