                    <h1>Clinopodium pulegium</h1>
<p>Clinopodium pulegium, commonly known as pennyroyal, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, opposite, ovate leaves with a strongly aromatic, mint-like scent due to the presence of pulegone. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its roots and leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported antiparasitic and antiseptic properties.</p>
<p>However, it is toxic to mammals and should be handled with care.</p>
