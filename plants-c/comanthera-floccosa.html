                    <h1>Comanthera floccosa</h1>
<p>Comanthera floccosa, commonly known as the woolly sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted for minimizing surface area to conserve moisture.</p>
<p>Comanthera floccosa is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun and demonstrating resilience to drought conditions.</p>
