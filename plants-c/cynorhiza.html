                    <h1>Cynorhiza</h1>
<p>Cynorhiza, commonly known as the rootstock of leguminous plants, is a specialized structure that plays a crucial role in nitrogen fixation.</p>
<p>It is the part of the plant that forms a symbiotic relationship with Rhizobia bacteria, which reside in nodules along the root surface. These nodules enable the plant to convert atmospheric nitrogen into a usable form, enriching the soil. The cynorhiza is often used in agricultural practices for soil improvement and crop rotation.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its contribution to sustainable farming and ecological balance.</p>
