                    <h1>Calycothrix creswellii</h1>
<p>Calycothrix creswellii, commonly known as the Creswell's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense, tangled masses on its host, which can affect the host's health.</p>
<p>Calycothrix creswellii is an interesting example of plant parasitism in forest ecosystems.</p>
