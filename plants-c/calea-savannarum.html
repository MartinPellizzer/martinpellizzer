<p>Calea savannarum, commonly known as the sacred candle plant, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white, candle-like flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it retain moisture in its native arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Calea savannarum is also valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities.</p>
