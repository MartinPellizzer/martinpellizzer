                    <h1>Caralluma punctata</h1>
<p>Caralluma punctata, commonly known as the spineless nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming at night. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Caralluma punctata is also valued as a low-maintenance ornamental plant in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance.</p>
