                    <h1>Chilochloa aspera</h1>
<p>Chilochloa aspera, commonly known as the rough chilochloa, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in damp forest margins or along streams.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
