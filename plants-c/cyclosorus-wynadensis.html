<p>Cyclosorus wynadensis, commonly known as the Wynad water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its spores are released into the water, allowing for propagation through aquatic dispersal.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus wynadensis plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms.</p>
