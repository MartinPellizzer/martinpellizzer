<p>Cheilanthes albofusca, commonly known as the white-veined rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with prominent white veins, which help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It reproduces via spores and is often found growing on limestone or sandstone substrates.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes albofusca is a hardy, drought-tolerant species well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed environments.</p>
