                    <h1>Caragana frutex f. xerophytica</h1>
<p>Caragana frutex f. xerophytica, commonly known as the sandbar shrub, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a dwarf shrub with short, woody stems and small, compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by elongated, legume-like pods containing seeds. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>This species is often used for erosion control in sandy and gravelly soils due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements.</p>
