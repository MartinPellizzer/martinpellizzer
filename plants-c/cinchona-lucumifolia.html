                    <h1>Cinchona lucumifolia</h1>
<p>Cinchona lucumifolia, commonly known as the Andean quina, is a species of tree native to the cloud forests of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are elliptical and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds. It is closely related to other cinchona species, which are the source of quinine, a compound used in malaria treatment.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, Cinchona lucumifolia is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
