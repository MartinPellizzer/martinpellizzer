<p>Cerastium ligusticum subsp.</p>
<p>palustre, commonly known as marsh mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant, and it produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of water bodies. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions.</p>
<p>Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance in wetland ecosystems.</p>
