<p>Chrysanthemum bipinnatum subsp.</p>
<p>huronense, commonly known as Huron's doubleleaf chrysanthemum, is a rare and native species found primarily in the Huron Region of Ontario, Canada. It is characterized by its finely dissected, bipinnate leaves that give it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for wetland health.</p>
