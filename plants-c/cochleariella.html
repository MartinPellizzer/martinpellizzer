                    <h1>Cochleariella</h1>
<p>Cochleariella, commonly known as the "moss rose" or "dwarf rockrose," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are small, mat-forming plants native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have succulent, fleshy leaves and produce clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. Cochleariella species are often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments.</p>
<p>They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-growing mats.</p>
