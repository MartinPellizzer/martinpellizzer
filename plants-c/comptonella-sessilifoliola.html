                    <h1>Comptonella sessilifoliola</h1>
<p>Comptonella sessilifoliola, commonly known as the narrow-leaf comptonella, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, elliptical leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack stalks. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by small, spherical fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Comptonella sessilifoliola is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats.</p>
