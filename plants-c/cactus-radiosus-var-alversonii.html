                    <h1>Cactus radiosus var. alversonii</h1>
<p>Cactus radiosus var. alversonii, commonly known as the Alverson's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and are adapted for water storage. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by various insects and birds. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and protecting it from herbivores.</p>
<p>This cactus thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert plains.</p>
