<p>Cheilanthes tenuifolia subsp.</p>
<p>wrightii, commonly known as Wright's slender rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, including limestone and granite, and is well adapted to low moisture conditions. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging landscapes.</p>
