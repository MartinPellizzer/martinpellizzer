<p>Callitriche aquatica subsp.</p>
<p>stagnalis, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands, where it can establish dense mats on the water surface or along the margins.</p>
<p>The plant has whorled leaves that are often floating or submerged, and it produces tiny, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink. Its reproductive strategy involves both sexual reproduction through seeds and vegetative propagation via stem fragments.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
