<p>Cyathea carolihenrici, commonly known as the Carolihenrici's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, with a thick, fibrous root system that helps anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Cyathea carolihenrici is often found in lowland rainforests, where it plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
