                    <h1>Cereus neonesioticus</h1>
<p>Cereus neonesioticus, commonly known as the Neonesiotic Cereus, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus with a tall, spindly stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, a characteristic feature of many nocturnal cacti. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a dense covering of fine hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive.</p>
