<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests, preferring rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy texture, while its flowers range in color from white to pink.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Conami portoricensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
