                    <h1>Cyperus ischnos var. arsenii</h1>
<p>Cyperus ischnos var. arsenii, commonly known as the arsenic sedges, is a variant of the sedge genus Cyperus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late summer. This plant is often found in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its ability to tolerate saline and waterlogged soils makes it an important species in certain ecological contexts.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely cultivated and remains relatively obscure in horticultural use.</p>
