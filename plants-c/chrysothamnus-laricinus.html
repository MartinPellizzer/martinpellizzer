<p>Chrysothamnus laricinus, commonly known as the silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, spherical clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species.</p>
