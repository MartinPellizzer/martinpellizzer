                    <h1>Calligonum lipskyi var. commutatum</h1>
<p>Calligonum lipskyi var. commutatum, commonly known as the sand spurge, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It has small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots enable it to thrive in sandy soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>This species is also known for its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
