                    <h1>Carex × almii</h1>
<p>Carex × almii, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid between Carex echinata and Carex lyngbyei, resulting in a unique combination of characteristics from both parents. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, where it thrives in well-drained soil. Its foliage is grass-like, with narrow, erect leaves that form dense clumps, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, Carex × almii is often used in ecological landscaping and wetland restoration projects.</p>
