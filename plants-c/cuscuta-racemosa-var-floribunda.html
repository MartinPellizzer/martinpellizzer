                    <h1>Cuscuta racemosa var. floribunda</h1>
<p>Cuscuta racemosa var. floribunda, commonly known as yellow dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity. The plant has slender, thread-like stems that wrap tightly around its host, forming a dense network. It is often found on crops such as corn and soybeans, making it an agricultural pest.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to infest a wide range of hosts contribute to its invasive nature in various ecosystems.</p>
