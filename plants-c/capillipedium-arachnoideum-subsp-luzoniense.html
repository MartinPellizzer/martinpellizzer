<p>Capillipedium arachnoideum subsp.</p>
<p>luzoniense, commonly known as the Luzon spider orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like inflorescence and small, delicate flowers with intricate patterns.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within montane forests, often on rocky or mossy substrates. Its leaves are broad and strap-shaped, and it produces a distinctive, elongated flower spike.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental degradation.</p>
