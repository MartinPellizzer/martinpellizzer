                    <h1>Cyclosorus elmerorum</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus elmerorum, commonly known as Elmer's cyclosorus, is a rare and delicate aquatic fern native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, shaded streams and springs, often growing in rocky substrates. The plant features slender, creeping rhizomes and small, orbicular leaves with a distinctive wavy margin. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health.</p>
