                    <h1>Ceratozamia totonacorum</h1>
<p>Ceratozamia totonacorum, commonly known as the Totonac cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the humid lowland forests of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in its native region.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on plant evolution and conservation.</p>
