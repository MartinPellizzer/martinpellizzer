                    <h1>Castilleja lanata</h1>
<p>Castilleja lanata, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant features showy, red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance.</p>
<p>Castilleja lanata is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe.</p>
