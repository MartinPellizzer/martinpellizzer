<p>Cardamine maritima proles rupestris, commonly known as the coastal watercress, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in rocky, coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, edible leaves and flowers. The plant typically thrives in damp, saline soils along the shores of the British Isles. Its leaves are often submerged or partially submerged, allowing it to absorb nutrients from tidal waters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
