                    <h1>Correorchis cylindrostachya</h1>
<p>Correorchis cylindrostachya, commonly known as the cylindrical-stalked coralroot, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients, growing in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers arranged in a spike, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
