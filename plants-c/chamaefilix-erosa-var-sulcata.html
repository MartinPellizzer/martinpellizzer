                    <h1>Chamaefilix erosa var. sulcata</h1>
<p>Chamaefilix erosa var. sulcata, commonly known as the crested or curled sand sage, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and distinctive, often curled or rosette-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
