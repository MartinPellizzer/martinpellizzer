<p>Coryphantha bussleri, commonly known as the Bussler's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, low-growing plant with thick, ribbed stems that store water, a characteristic common among desert plants. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, which develops after flowering, is a fleshy, edible pear-shaped structure.</p>
<p>Coryphantha bussleri is well adapted to arid environments, with spines that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
