<p>Cirrhopetalum blepharistes, commonly known as the fringed petal orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers with elongated petals that give it a unique, flowing appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The orchid's name reflects the fringed edges of its petals, which are a striking feature in its floral display.</p>
