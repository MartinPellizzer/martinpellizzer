                    <h1>Cuscuta leucosphaera</h1>
<p>Cuscuta leucosphaera, commonly known as white globe dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, white, globe-shaped flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating on the surface of host plants. The plant's stems are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's tissues to extract water and nutrients. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host and is considered a potential agricultural weed.</p>
