                    <h1>Cyanobotrys</h1>
<p>Cyanobotrys, commonly known as the blue-green algae, is a type of cyanobacteria that thrives in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to perform photosynthesis, similar to plants, and it contains chlorophyll a, which gives it its characteristic blue-green color. Cyanobotrys can form dense blooms in freshwater systems, sometimes leading to algal blooms that impact water quality. It plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, some species can produce toxins that are harmful to aquatic life and humans.</p>
