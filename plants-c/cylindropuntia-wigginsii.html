<p>Cylindropuntia wigginsii, commonly known as the Wiggins's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems, which are typically green and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements.</p>
<p>This cactus is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
