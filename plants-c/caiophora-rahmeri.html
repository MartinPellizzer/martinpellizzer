                    <h1>Caiophora rahmeri</h1>
<p>Caiophora rahmeri, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has small, pale green leaves and produces delicate, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires specific humidity and temperature conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
