                    <h1>Callitriche cuneifolia</h1>
<p>Callitriche cuneifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense spikes, often floating just above the water surface.</p>
<p>Callitriche cuneifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its dense growth.</p>
