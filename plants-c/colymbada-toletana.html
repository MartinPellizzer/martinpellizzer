                    <h1>Colymbada toletana</h1>
<p>Colymbada toletana, commonly known as the Toletan marsh orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to specific wetland habitats in Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant with a distinctive inflorescence composed of several showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant has a short, underground rhizome and produces small, linear leaves that are adapted to waterlogged soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>
