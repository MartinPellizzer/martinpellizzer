                            <h1>Callicoma Serratifolium Var. Ferruginea</h1>
<p>Ferrugineous callicoma, scientifically known as Callicoma serratifolium var. ferruginea, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. Its unique appearance is characterized by its rust-colored bark and serrated, lance-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive visual appeal. This variant of Callicoma serratifolium thrives in humid, shaded environments where it forms dense undergrowth in the forest floor. Despite its beauty, it remains a lesser-known species due to its limited distribution and the challenges of studying it in its natural habitat. Conservation efforts are increasingly important to protect this plant from the threats posed by habitat loss and climate change.</p>
