<p>White flame tree, scientifically known as Chithonanthus restiaceus, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. Its most notable feature is its brilliant white flowers that resemble flames, giving it its common name. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates. It produces small, edible fruits that are sometimes used in local cuisines. Despite its beauty, the White flame tree is relatively rare in the wild and requires specific care to flourish.</p>
