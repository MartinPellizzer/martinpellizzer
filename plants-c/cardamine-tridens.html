                    <h1>Cardamine tridens</h1>
<p>Cardamine tridens, commonly known as the three-toothed water crowfoot, is a delicate aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found along the edges of ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant features finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water surface or emerge from the water. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Cardamine tridens plays a role in supporting aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for invertebrates and young fish.</p>
