<p>Cochemiea capensis, commonly known as the Cape cholla, is a species of cactus native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus with a ribbed stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Cochemiea capensis is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water.</p>
