                    <h1>Cassebeera arseni</h1>
<p>Cassebeera arseni, commonly known as the arsenic tree, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals, it has been studied for potential use in phytoremediation efforts.</p>
