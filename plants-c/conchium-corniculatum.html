                    <h1>Conchium corniculatum</h1>
<p>Conchium corniculatum, commonly known as the horned lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, branched thallus with a yellowish to orange-brown coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is typically found on rocks, tree bark, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Conchium corniculatum is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
