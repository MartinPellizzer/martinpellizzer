                    <h1>Cycas yorkiana</h1>
<p>Cycas yorkiana, commonly known as the York's cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a gymnosperm, characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base of the trunk and female cones emerging from the upper stem. Cycas yorkiana is adapted to warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
