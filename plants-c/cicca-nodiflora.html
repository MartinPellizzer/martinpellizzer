<p>Cicca nodiflora, commonly known as the clustered cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>

The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Native to parts of Southeast Asia, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
