                    <h1>Caralluma dioscoridis</h1>
<p>Caralluma dioscoridis, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of India and Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, branched stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Caralluma dioscoridis is also known for its traditional use in Ayurvedic medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
