<p>Cyclosorus pennigerus, commonly known as the broad-leaved water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like structure, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and has floating leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its reproductive system involves the production of small, yellowish flowers that emerge from the water surface.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus pennigerus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
