<p>Cynanchum brachyphyllum, commonly known as the short-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers, which are typically followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Cynanchum brachyphyllum is also noted for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is a distinguishing feature of the genus.</p>
