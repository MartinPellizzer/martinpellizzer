                    <h1>Cystacanthus yunnanensis</h1>
<p>Cystacanthus yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan cystacanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in moist, shaded environments within forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native ecosystem.</p>
