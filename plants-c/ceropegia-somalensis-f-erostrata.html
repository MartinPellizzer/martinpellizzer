<p>Ceropegia somalensis f. erostrata, commonly known as the Somalian milkweed, is a unique and rare plant species native to the arid regions of Somalia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed and dogbane species. The plant is characterized by its trailing stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowers are tubular and typically pink or purple in color, adapted for specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
