                    <h1>Craibiodendron scleranthum</h1>
<p>Craibiodendron scleranthum, commonly known as the desert thornbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, often spiny leaves adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Craibiodendron scleranthum plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
