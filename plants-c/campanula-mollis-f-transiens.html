                    <h1>Campanula mollis f. transiens</h1>
<p>Campanula mollis f. transiens, commonly known as the Transient Bellflower, is a hybrid form of the Campanula mollis species.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The flowers are usually blue to violet in color, with a delicate, bell-like appearance that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders.</p>
<p>This cultivar is noted for its shorter flowering period compared to the species, hence its name "transiens," which means transient or fleeting.</p>
