<p>Cheiranthus gramineus, commonly known as wall pepper or garden mustards, is an annual flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Europe and western Asia and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found growing along roadsides, in gardens, and on rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to self-seed, it is considered a weed in some regions.</p>
