                    <h1>Cousinia armena</h1>
<p>Cousinia armena, commonly known as Armenian cushion grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that forms dense, mat-like clumps of foliage. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Cousinia armena is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
