                    <h1>Cuscuta europaea</h1>
<p>Cuscuta europaea, commonly known as the European dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a fibrous, thread-like structure that attaches to its host. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity. It can infest a variety of crops and wild plants, causing significant agricultural damage.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, with the plant often dying when the host is removed.</p>
