                    <h1>Cleistocactus croceiflorus</h1>
<p>Cleistocactus croceiflorus, commonly known as the golden flowered cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of spines that protect it from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that open only at night, a characteristic known as nyctinasty. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few days before wilting.</p>
<p>This cactus is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
