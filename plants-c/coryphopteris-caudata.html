<p>Coryphopteris caudata, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow, and often hairy fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
