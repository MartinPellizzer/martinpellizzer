<p>Celosia procumbens, commonly known as the flame flower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers.

<p>Celosia procumbens is popular in ornamental gardening for its striking appearance and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
