                    <h1>Cirsium litorale</h1>
<p>Cirsium litorale, commonly known as sea thistle, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found growing along cliffs and dunes. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss, an adaptation to its harsh coastal environment.</p>
<p>Cirsium litorale plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and provides habitat for various insects and birds.</p>
