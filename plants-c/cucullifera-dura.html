<p>Cucullifera dura, commonly known as the hard-shelled orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and distinctive, helmet-shaped flowers that give it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are typically pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Cucullifera dura is considered endangered and is protected in many countries.</p>
