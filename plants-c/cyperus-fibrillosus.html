<p>Cyperus fibrillosus, commonly known as the silky flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils, it is often found in areas with high humidity and frequent rainfall.</p>
