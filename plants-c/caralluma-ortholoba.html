                    <h1>Caralluma ortholoba</h1>
<p>Caralluma ortholoba, commonly known as the devil's tongue cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spineless, cylindrical stems that often branch out into a shrub-like form. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to tubercles, which help minimize water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Caralluma ortholoba is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems for survival.</p>
