<p>Carex nubigena subsp.</p>
<p>pseudoarenicola, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and dark green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna.</p>
