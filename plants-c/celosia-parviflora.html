                    <h1>Celosia parviflora</h1>
<p>Celosia parviflora, commonly known as the flame flower or crown of thorns, is a flowering plant native to Africa, particularly South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers at the base of these colorful bracts. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance.</p>
<p>Celosia parviflora is drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and coastal gardens.</p>
