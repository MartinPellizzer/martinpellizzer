                    <h1>Croton glandulosus var. arenicola</h1>
<p>Croton glandulosus var. arenicola, commonly known as the sand croton, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
