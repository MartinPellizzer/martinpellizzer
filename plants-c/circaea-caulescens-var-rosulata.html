                    <h1>Circaea caulescens var. rosulata</h1>
<p>Circaea caulescens var. rosulata, commonly known as the rose-leaved whitebeard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is closely related to other species in the Primulaceae family, sharing similar floral structures and ecological preferences.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments.</p>
