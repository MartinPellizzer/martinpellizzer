<p>Cerasus microcarpa subsp.</p>
<p>diffusa, commonly known as the Japanese flowering cherry or mountain cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that turn yellow in autumn and its showy clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic floral display.</p>
