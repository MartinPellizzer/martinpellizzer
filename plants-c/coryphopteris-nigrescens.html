                    <h1>Coryphopteris nigrescens</h1>
<p>Coryphopteris nigrescens, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that often turn a deep blackish color when dry. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in the soil.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
