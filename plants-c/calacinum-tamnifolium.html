                    <h1>Calacinum tamnifolium</h1>
<p>Calacinum tamnifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf calacinum, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, silver-green leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in regions with mild winters and hot, dry summers.</p>
