                    <h1>Convolvulus palustris</h1>
<p>Convolvulus palustris, commonly known as marsh bindweed, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soils. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in areas with consistent moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in some regions, though it also serves as a food source for various insects and birds.</p>
