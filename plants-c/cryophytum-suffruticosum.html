                    <h1>Cryophytum suffruticosum</h1>
<p>Cryophytum suffruticosum, commonly known as the Antarctic hair-crisp, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Antarctica.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in extreme cold and nutrient-poor soils. Its small, white flowers bloom during the brief summer season, and it has a unique ability to survive freezing temperatures by entering a dormant state. The plant's leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help insulate it from the harsh cold.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is one of the few flowering plants that can survive in such extreme environments.</p>
