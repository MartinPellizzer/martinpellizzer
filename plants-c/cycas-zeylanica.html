                    <h1>Cycas zeylanica</h1>
<p>Cycas zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon cycad, is a primitive gymnosperm native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces both male and female cones, with the female cones bearing a distinctive red, fleshy aril that resembles a fruit. Cycas zeylanica is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
