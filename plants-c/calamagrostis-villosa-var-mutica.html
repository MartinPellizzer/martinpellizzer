                    <h1>Calamagrostis villosa var. mutica</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis villosa var. mutica, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, silky florets and tall, slender culms that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often used in ornamental gardening for their aesthetic appeal. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it both a valuable ecological plant and a potential weed in certain environments.</p>
