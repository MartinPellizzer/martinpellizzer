                    <h1>Cocos campicola</h1>
<p>Cocos campicola, commonly known as the Mexican coconut or dwarf coconut, is a small, palm-like plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters, with a slender trunk and broad, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, edible fruits that contain a single kernel, similar to true coconuts but much smaller. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of food.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size, it is well-suited for gardens and landscapes in subtropical regions.</p>
