<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. This variety is adapted to moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a useful plant for ecological restoration and wetland landscaping.</p>
