<p>Ceropegia albocastanea, commonly known as the White-barked Ceropegia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, tubular stems that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting specific pollinators like moths. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Ceropegia albocastanea is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
