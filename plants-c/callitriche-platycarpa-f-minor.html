                    <h1>Callitriche platycarpa f. minor</h1>
<p>Callitriche platycarpa f. minor, commonly known as the narrow-fruit water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, branching stems that often float on the water surface, with small, oval-shaped leaves arranged in whorls. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and are borne in clusters at the nodes along the stems.</p>
<p>This subspecies is distinguished by its narrower fruits compared to the typical form, which contributes to its unique ecological niche.</p>
