                    <h1>Cystopteris fragilis var. woodsioides</h1>
<p>Cystopteris fragilis var. woodsioides, commonly known as the brittle maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species characterized by its finely divided, bi-lobed fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to eastern North America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's fronds are typically light green and have a fragile, almost papery texture, which gives it its common name. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky crevices and along stream banks, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies.</p>
