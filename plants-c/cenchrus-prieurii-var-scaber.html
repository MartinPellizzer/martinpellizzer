                    <h1>Cenchrus prieurii var. scaber</h1>
<p>Cenchrus prieurii var. scaber, commonly known as roughhair grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, tufted growth habit and wiry, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences with small, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it useful for erosion control and as a forage plant in drought-prone areas.</p>
