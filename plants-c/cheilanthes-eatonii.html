<p>Cheilanthes eatonii, commonly known as the Eatonâ€™s rockcap, is a species of fern found in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It typically grows on rock surfaces or in crevices, making it well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed habitats.</p>
<p>Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
