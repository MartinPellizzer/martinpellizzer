                    <h1>Cypripedium nigritum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium nigritum, commonly known as the blackroot lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive dark purple to black rhizomes and its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cypripedium nigritum is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
