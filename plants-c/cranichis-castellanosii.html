<p>Cranichis castellanosii, commonly known as the Castellanos' orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, adapted to the high-altitude environments where it thrives.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
