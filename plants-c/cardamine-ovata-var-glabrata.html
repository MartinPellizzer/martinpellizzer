                    <h1>Cardamine ovata var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Cardamine ovata var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth water-crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, calcareous habitats.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with a rounded base and smooth, waxy surfaces, distinguishing it from other varieties of Cardamine. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wet meadows and stream banks.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates.</p>
