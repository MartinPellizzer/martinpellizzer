<p>Copiapoa calderana subsp.</p>
<p>atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama copiapoa, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It is a columnar cactus with a solitary stem that often develops a bulbous base as it matures.</p>
<p>The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
