                    <h1>Cactus latispinus</h1>
<p>Cactus latispinus, commonly known as the broad-spined cactus, is a species native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. Its spines are modified leaves that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Cactus latispinus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
