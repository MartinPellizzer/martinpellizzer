                    <h1>Cynoglossum officinale</h1>
<p>Cynoglossum officinale, commonly known as hound's tongue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features distinctive, broad, tongue-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous, and it can spread through both seeds and rhizomes.</p>
<p>While it has ornamental value, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora.</p>
