The plant produces showy, red to orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as meadows and foothills.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it an important component of its ecosystem and a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
