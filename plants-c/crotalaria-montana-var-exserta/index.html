                            <h1>Crotalaria Montana Var. Exserta</h1>
<p>Crotalaria montana var. exserta, scientifically known as Crotalaria montana var. exserta, is a rare and fascinating member of the Fabaceae family. Native to specific regions of South America, this plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its distinctive features include striking yellow flowers and unique seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Despite its beauty, it is often considered a weed due to its invasive potential in certain environments. This plant plays an important role in both ecological systems and traditional medicine.</p>
