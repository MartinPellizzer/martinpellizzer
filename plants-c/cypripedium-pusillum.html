                    <h1>Cypripedium pusillum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf lady's slipper, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a unique feature among orchids. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cypripedium pusillum is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
