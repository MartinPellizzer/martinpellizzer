<p>Collinsia glandulosa, commonly known as the stickyleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture and help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Collinsia glandulosa is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
