<p>Chamaepeuce sinuata, commonly known as the red sandreed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, grass-like foliage and striking red or orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is highly drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to desert environments. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and minimal water requirements.</p>
