                    <h1>Cyclostemon curtisii</h1>
<p>Cyclostemon curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Native to the mountainous regions of southern China, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclostemon curtisii is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
