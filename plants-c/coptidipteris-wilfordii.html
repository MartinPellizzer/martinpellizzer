                    <h1>Coptidipteris wilfordii</h1>
<p>Coptidipteris wilfordii, commonly known as the Wilford's water fern, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four parts, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its reproductive structures include tiny, spore-producing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
