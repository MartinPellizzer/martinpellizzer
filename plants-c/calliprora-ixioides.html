<p>Calliprora ixioides, commonly known as the white-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America and relies on host trees for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or yellow and contain toxic compounds that deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Calliprora ixioides plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain bird species that disperse its seeds.</p>
