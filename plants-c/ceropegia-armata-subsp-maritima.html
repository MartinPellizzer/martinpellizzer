<p>Ceropegia armata subsp.</p>
<p>maritima, commonly known as the coastal milkweed, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that are adapted for pollination by specific insects. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal.</p>
