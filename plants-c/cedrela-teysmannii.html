                    <h1>Cedrela teysmannii</h1>
<p>Cedrela teysmannii, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree belonging to the Meliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of Africa, including countries like Ghana and Nigeria, and thrives in humid, tropical climates. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a dense canopy. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local economies.</p>
<p>However, overharvesting has led to its decline, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>
