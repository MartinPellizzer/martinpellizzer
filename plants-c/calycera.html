<p>Calycera, commonly known as the "flowering spurge," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or herbs native to Africa and the Mediterranean region. The plants are characterized by their distinctive, often colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. Calycera species typically have small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia.</p>
<p>These plants are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments and are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
