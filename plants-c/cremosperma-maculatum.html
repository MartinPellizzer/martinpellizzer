                    <h1>Cremosperma maculatum</h1>
<p>Cremosperma maculatum, commonly known as the spotted sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted for water storage, allowing it to survive prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic environments.</p>
