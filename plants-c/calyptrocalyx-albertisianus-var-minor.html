<p>Calyptrocalyx albertisianus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser Albertisian calyptrocalyx, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring tightly enclosed flowers that open only under specific environmental conditions. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to white, with a distinctive calyx that remains partially closed during development.</p>
<p>This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential adaptations to its microhabitat.</p>
