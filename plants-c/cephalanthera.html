                    <h1>Cephalanthera</h1>
<p>Cephalanthera, commonly known as the white helleborine, is a genus of orchids native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their showy, often white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered at the top of the stem. They possess a unique root system that includes mycorrhizal associations, which are essential for nutrient uptake. Cephalanthera species are generally herbaceous perennials that thrive in woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Their flowers are pollinated primarily by flies and beetles, making them important for insect biodiversity.</p>
