                    <h1>Cactus areolosus</h1>
<p>Cactus areolosus, commonly known as the areola cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rainfall. Its areoles, which are the raised areas from which spines, flowers, and branches emerge, are distinct and well-defined.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its drought tolerance and ornamental value in desert gardens.</p>
