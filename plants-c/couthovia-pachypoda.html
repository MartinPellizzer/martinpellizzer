                    <h1>Couthovia pachypoda</h1>
<p>Couthovia pachypoda, commonly known as the broadleaf orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, violet-blue petals and a distinctive, elongated spur that extends from the flower. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in the humid, shaded environments it prefers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Couthovia pachypoda is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
