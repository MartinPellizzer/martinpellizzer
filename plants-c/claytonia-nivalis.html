                    <h1>Claytonia nivalis</h1>
<p>Claytonia nivalis, commonly known as snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Claytonia nivalis is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
