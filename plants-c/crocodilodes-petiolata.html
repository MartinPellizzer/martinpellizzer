<p>Crocodilodes petiolata, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval or lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction, it can become invasive in some regions.</p>
