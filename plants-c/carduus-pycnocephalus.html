                <h1>Carduus pycnocephalus</h1>
<p>Carduus pycnocephalus, commonly known as the Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa but has become an invasive species in many parts of the world, including the western United States. The plant is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a dense, spherical cluster of small, pale purple flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and wastelands.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and seed dispersal make it a challenging weed to control.</p>
