                    <h1>Cardamine rotundifolia var. diversifolia</h1>
<p>Cardamine rotundifolia var. diversifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features alternate, broadly rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender, erect stems. Its root system consists of a short, thickened rhizome with numerous fibrous roots, allowing it to thrive in waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the Ruprikingiaceae family and is often found in stream banks and wet meadows.</p>
