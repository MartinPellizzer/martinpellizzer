                    <h1>Cyclosorus thailandicus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus thailandicus, commonly known as the Thai cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to the freshwater ecosystems of Thailand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures, including small, spore-bearing structures, are adapted for dispersal by water currents.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
