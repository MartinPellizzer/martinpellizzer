                    <h1>Coryphopteris atjehensis</h1>
<p>Coryphopteris atjehensis, commonly known as the Atjeh holly fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the high-altitude regions of Sumatra, Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as cloud forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental degradation.</p>
