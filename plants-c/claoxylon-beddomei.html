<p>Claoxylon beddomei, commonly known as the Beddome's tallowwood, is a tropical rainforest tree native to northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and large, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is a slow-growing species that plays a significant role in the ecological structure of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and land clearing.</p>
