                    <h1>Claoxylon mannii</h1>
<p>Claoxylon mannii, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. Its timber is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it an important commercial species.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable in many parts of its range.</p>
