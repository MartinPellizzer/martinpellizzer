                    <h1>Coryphopteris athyrioides</h1>
<p>Coryphopteris athyrioides, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
