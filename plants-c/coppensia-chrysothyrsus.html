                    <h1>Coppensia chrysothyrsus</h1>
<p>Coppensia chrysothyrsus, commonly known as the golden thorn, is a unique plant native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its dense, spiny growth and striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly the Rodrigues fruit bat, which plays a crucial role in its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Coppensia chrysothyrsus is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
