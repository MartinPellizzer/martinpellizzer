<p>Calamagrostis hissarica, commonly known as the Hissar reed, is a perennial grass native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often adorned with a fine, silky texture. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, typically in shades of brown or purple, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and riverbanks, and is often found in regions with temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects.</p>
