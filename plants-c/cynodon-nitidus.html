                    <h1>Cynodon nitidus</h1>
<p>Cynodon nitidus, commonly known as velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and a distinctive bluish-green color, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it a valuable plant for erosion control.</p>
<p>Cynodon nitidus is also used in horticulture for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
