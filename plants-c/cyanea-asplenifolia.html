<p>Cyanea asplenifolia, commonly known as the fern-like cyanea, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that resemble those of the brake fern. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Cyanea asplenifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coastal areas or on rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
