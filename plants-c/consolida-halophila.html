<p>Consolida halophila, commonly known as the saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellow or orange flowers and hairy, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss. This species is adapted to grow in soils with high salinity, making it a valuable plant for reclaiming degraded land. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, enhancing its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in stabilizing coastal and desert soils while providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
