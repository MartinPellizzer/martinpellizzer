<p>Cranichis barkleyi, commonly known as the Barkley's spider orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, slender petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its botanical features include a short, erect stem with a single, showy flower that blooms in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
