<p>Cystopteris fragilis subsp.</p>
<p>fragilis, commonly known as the brittle bladder fern, is a delicate fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds that are typically bright green and somewhat translucent.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spore-bearing sori on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its fragile, papery fronds give it a distinctive appearance, and it is often found in association with other moisture-loving ferns.</p>
