                    <h1>Coryphopteris gymnopoda var. bintangensis</h1>
<p>Coryphopteris gymnopoda var. bintangensis, commonly known as the Bintangensis huperzia, is a rare fern species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are arranged in a dense, compact rosette. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
