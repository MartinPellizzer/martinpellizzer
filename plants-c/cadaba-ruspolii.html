<p>Cadaba ruspolii, commonly known as the rock rose or rock hibiscus, is a shrub native to the island of Socotra.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, white, and yellow, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, making it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Cadaba ruspolii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
