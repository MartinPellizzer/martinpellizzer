<p>Calypso bulbosa subsp.</p>
<p>occidentalis, commonly known as the western fairy slipper, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its striking, pinkish-purple pouch-shaped flowers that resemble a fairy's slipper, which are adapted to trap small insects for pollination.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks, often growing in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
