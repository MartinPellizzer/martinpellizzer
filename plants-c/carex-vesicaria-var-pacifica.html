                    <h1>Carex vesicaria var. pacifica</h1>
<p>Carex vesicaria var. pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along shorelines and tidal zones. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ecological role in coastal ecosystems and its ability to thrive in saline environments.</p>
