                    <h1>Canariothamnus rupicola</h1>
<p>Canariothamnus rupicola, commonly known as the rock canarythamnus, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
