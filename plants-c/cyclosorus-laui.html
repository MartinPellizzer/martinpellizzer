<p>Cyclosorus laui, commonly known as the Laui's cyclosorus, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leafy structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a thalloid structure with distinct leaf-like lobes arranged in a spiral pattern. It is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus laui plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
