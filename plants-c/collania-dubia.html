                    <h1>Collania dubia</h1>
<p>Collania dubia, commonly known as the rare desert orchid, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, typically during the cooler months. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Collania dubia is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
