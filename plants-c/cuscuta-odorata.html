The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to infest a variety of host species, including crops and ornamental plants. It spreads through seeds and can cause significant damage to agricultural systems.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, where it attaches using specialized haustoria to extract water and nutrients.</p>
