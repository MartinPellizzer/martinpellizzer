                    <h1>Cyperus polystachyos var. holosericeus</h1>
<p>Cyperus polystachyos var. holosericeus, commonly known as the silky flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brown flowers. The plant is characterized by its silky, hairy appearance, particularly on the stems and leaves, which give it a soft, almost velvety texture. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in marshes, swales, and along waterways.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats.</p>
