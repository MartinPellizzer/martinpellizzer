                    <h1>Cirsium × iburiense</h1>
<p>Cirsium × iburiense, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cirsium undulatum and Cirsium vulgare, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, and it has a rosette of spiny, blue-green leaves. Its purple to pink flowers appear in late summer, and the plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, it is often classified as an invasive species in some regions.</p>
