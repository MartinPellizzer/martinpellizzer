<p>Cyanea dunbariae, commonly known as the Dunbar's sea hibiscus, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or rocky soils with ample sunlight. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyanea dunbariae is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts.</p>
