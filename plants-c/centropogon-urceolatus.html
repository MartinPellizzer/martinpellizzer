                    <h1>Centropogon urceolatus</h1>
<p>Centropogon urceolatus, commonly known as the water plantain, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in a spike, which are pollinated by insects. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in marshy areas, making it ecologically significant.</p>
<p>Centropogon urceolatus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils.</p>
