                    <h1>Conomorpha nemoralis</h1>
<p>Conomorpha nemoralis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it thrives in disturbed soils in open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems by influencing the growth and distribution of its host plants.</p>
