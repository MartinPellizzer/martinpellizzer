                    <h1>Cenchrus pallidus</h1>
<p>Cenchrus pallidus, commonly known as the pale sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow to brown florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its fibrous roots contribute to soil stabilization, making it useful in erosion control.</p>
<p>Cenchrus pallidus is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
