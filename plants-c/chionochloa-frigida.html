                    <h1>Chionochloa frigida</h1>
<p>Chionochloa frigida, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the cold climates of South America and New Zealand.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subantarctic environments, often found in rocky soils and exposed mountain areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to insulate it against extreme cold. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in harsh, high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
