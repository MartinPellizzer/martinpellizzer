<p>Ceradenia semiadnata, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Ceradenia semiadnata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
