<p>Cicendia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved sandbur, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and produces small, spiny fruits that are adapted for seed dispersal by animals. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
