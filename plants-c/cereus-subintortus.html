The plant produces large, night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which attract pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and unique flowering behavior, it is a popular choice for collectors and gardeners in suitable climates.</p>
