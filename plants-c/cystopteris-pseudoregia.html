<p>Cystopteris pseudoregia, commonly known as the New Zealand shield fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Cystopteris pseudoregia make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora.</p>
