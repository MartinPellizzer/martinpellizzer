<p>Cyclosorus loyalii, commonly known as the Loyal Island water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to the island of Loyal in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically four-lobed. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its reproductive structures are unique, with sporangia developing on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus loyalii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
