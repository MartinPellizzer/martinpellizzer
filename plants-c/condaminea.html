                    <h1>Condaminea</h1>
<p>Condaminea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique appearance, featuring a single, delicate white or pale green flower that resembles a ghostly face. The plant has a short, slender stem and lacks true leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. Condaminea thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on the bases of trees or in dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
