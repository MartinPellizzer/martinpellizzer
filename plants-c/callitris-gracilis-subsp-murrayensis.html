<p>Callitris gracilis subsp.</p>
<p>murrayensis, commonly known as the Murray cedar, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil, making it a resilient species.</p>
<p>The Murray cedar is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and is valued for its ecological and historical significance.</p>
