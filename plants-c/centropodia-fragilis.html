                    <h1>Centropodia fragilis</h1>
<p>Centropodia fragilis, commonly known as the brittle centropodia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, fragile stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth of tropical forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Centropodia fragilis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
