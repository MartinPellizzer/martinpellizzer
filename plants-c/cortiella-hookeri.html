                    <h1>Cortiella hookeri</h1>
<p>Cortiella hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's cortiella, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Corticiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose or foliose growth form, typically forming a thin, flat or crust-like layer on the surface of rocks or bark. The thallus is usually pale yellow to orange in color, and the apothecia are small, disc-shaped, and often covered with a layer of fine, powdery material. It is found in temperate regions, particularly in areas with moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>This lichen is of interest to mycologists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in nutrient cycling.</p>
