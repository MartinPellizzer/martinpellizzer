                    <h1>Cephalomedinilla anisophylla</h1>
<p>Cephalomedinilla anisophylla, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers that typically feature a distinctive hood-like structure. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. Its leaves are usually elongated and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
