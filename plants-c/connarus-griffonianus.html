                    <h1>Connarus griffonianus</h1>
<p>Connarus griffonianus, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape, and it produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, Connarus griffonianus is often threatened by deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
