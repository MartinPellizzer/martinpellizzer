<p>Coronilla scandens, commonly known as the climbing crown vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by cylindrical seed pods. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Coronilla scandens is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants.</p>
