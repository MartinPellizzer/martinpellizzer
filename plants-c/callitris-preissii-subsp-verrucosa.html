<p>Callitris preissii subsp.</p>
<p>verrucosa, commonly known as the coastal cliffwood, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across sandy and rocky coastal habitats. It is well adapted to saline and wind-prone conditions, making it a resilient component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species for coastal stabilization and biodiversity.</p>
