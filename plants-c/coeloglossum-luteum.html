                    <h1>Coeloglossum luteum</h1>
<p>Coeloglossum luteum, commonly known as the golden twayblade, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette, and it lacks true leaves in the traditional sense, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Coeloglossum luteum is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
