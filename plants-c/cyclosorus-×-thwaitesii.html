                    <h1>Cyclosorus × thwaitesii</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus × thwaitesii, commonly known as the hybrid water clover, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cyclosorus sanguineus and Cyclosorus thwaitesii.</p>
<p>It is a small, aquatic fern that typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. Its reproductive structures are unique, with sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists and aquatic gardeners due to its ornamental value and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
