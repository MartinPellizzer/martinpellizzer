                    <h1>Crepidium seidenfadenianum</h1>
<p>Crepidium seidenfadenianum, commonly known as the Sikkim marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces a single spike of pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or marshy areas. Its flowers have a distinct, somewhat unpleasant odor, which is thought to attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
