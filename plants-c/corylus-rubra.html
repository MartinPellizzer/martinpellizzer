<p>Corylus rubra, commonly known as the red hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the hazelnut family (Betulaceae) and is characterized by its red-brown bark and oval, serrated leaves. The plant produces catkin-like male flowers and female flowers that develop into edible nuts enclosed in a spiky husk. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the nuts mature by late summer or early autumn.</p>
<p>Corylus rubra is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
