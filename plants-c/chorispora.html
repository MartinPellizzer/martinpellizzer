                    <h1>Chorispora</h1>
<p>Chorispora, commonly known as rock pepper or mountain pepper, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species that are typically found in arid or rocky environments, often in the western United States and Mexico. The plants are characterized by their small, pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves. They have adapted to harsh conditions through deep root systems and drought-resistant foliage.</p>
<p>Chorispora species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
