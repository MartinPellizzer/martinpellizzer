                    <h1>Cephalocereus senilis f. cristatus</h1>
<p>Cephalocereus senilis f. cristatus, commonly known as the Senita Hedgehog Cactus, is a unique variant of the Senita cactus characterized by its distinctive crown-like growth pattern.</p>
<p>This plant is native to the Sonoran Desert in North America, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid conditions. Its stems are cylindrical and covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual element to its otherwise spiky form.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
