<p>Copaifera sabulicola, commonly known as Brazilian copaiba, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and large, compound leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its resin, known as copaiba balsam, has been traditionally used for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Copaifera sabulicola plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability.</p>
