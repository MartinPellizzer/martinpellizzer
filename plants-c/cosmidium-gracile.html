<p>Cosmidium gracile, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including small spore-producing organs, are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Cosmidium gracile plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
