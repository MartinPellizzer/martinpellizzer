                    <h1>Cuscuta warneri</h1>
<p>Cuscuta warneri, commonly known as the Warner's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant attaches to its host using specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's tissues. It is often found growing on various wild plants, including grasses and shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant harm to its host, reducing its growth and vitality.</p>
