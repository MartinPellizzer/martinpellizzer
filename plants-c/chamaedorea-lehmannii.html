                    <h1>Chamaedorea lehmannii</h1>
<p>Chamaedorea lehmannii, commonly known as the Mexican evergreen or the lemon tree fern, is a compact, elegant palm native to the tropical regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a slender, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a fibrous, leafless sheath. The plant produces a single, feathery crown of elongated, pinnate leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes.</p>
