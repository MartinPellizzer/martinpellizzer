<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pinkish to purple flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it an important species in its native habitat.</p>
