                    <h1>Corybas montanus</h1>
<p>Corybas montanus, commonly known as the mountain hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, hood-like floral structure that encloses the reproductive organs, a feature typical of the Corybas genus. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a dark, velvety hood and a yellowish-green throat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or on rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
