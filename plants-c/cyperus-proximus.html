                    <h1>Cyperus proximus</h1>
<p>Cyperus proximus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and a dense cluster of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Cyperus proximus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems.</p>
