<p>Convolvulus semidigynus, commonly known as the narrowleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the bindweed family (Convolvulaceae) and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in the morning, hence its common name. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, and it has hairy stems that help it cling to surfaces.</p>
<p>Convolvulus semidigynus is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can be invasive in some regions.</p>
