                    <h1>Campanula velebitica f. divaricata</h1>
<p>Campanula velebitica f. divaricata, commonly known as the Velebit bellflower, is a rare and unique variant of the Campanula genus native to Croatia.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its distinctive, spreading growth habit and its bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The foliage is typically narrow and grass-like, forming a dense mat that helps retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
