                            <h1>Coronopus Rhytidocarpus</h1>
<p>Coralroot, scientifically known as Coronopus rhytidocarpus, is a rare and fascinating orchid species found in specific habitats across eastern Australia. This plant is unique for its striking coral-like appearance, with its roots resembling the branches of a coral reef. Unlike most orchids, it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a myco-heterotroph. Its delicate structure and unusual growth pattern make it a subject of both scientific interest and conservation concern. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Coralroot faces increasing threats to its survival.</p>
