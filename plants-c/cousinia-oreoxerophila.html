<p>Cousinia oreoxerophila, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with silver-gray foliage adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It has fibrous roots that help it retain moisture in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Cousinia oreoxerophila is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
