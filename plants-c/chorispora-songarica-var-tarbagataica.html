                    <h1>Chorispora songarica var. tarbagataica</h1>
<p>Chorispora songarica var. tarbagataica, commonly known as the Tarbagataic sandspurry, is a perennial plant native to the steppes of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its specific geographic distribution and slight morphological differences.</p>
