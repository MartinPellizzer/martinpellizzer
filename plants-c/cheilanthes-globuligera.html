<p>Cheilanthes globuligera, commonly known as the globular maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features delicate, fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
