                    <h1>Ctenopterella boivinii</h1>
<p>Ctenopterella boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's feather fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a soft, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
