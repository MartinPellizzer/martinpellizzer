<p>Caesalpinia nelsonii, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange floral bracts that resemble flames, which appear in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. Caesalpinia nelsonii thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
