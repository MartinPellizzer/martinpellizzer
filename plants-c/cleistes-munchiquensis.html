                    <h1>Cleistes munchiquensis</h1>
<p>Cleistes munchiquensis, commonly known as the Munchique cleistocarp, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its unique, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that are often hidden within a specialized, leaf-like bract. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous minute seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cleistes munchiquensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
