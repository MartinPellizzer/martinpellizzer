                    <h1>Cuscuta epithymiphyta</h1>
<p>Cuscuta epithymiphyta, commonly known as the dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, adhesive tendrils that attach to host plants. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize a wide range of hosts. It is often found on agricultural crops, weeds, and shrubs, making it a common weed in many regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
