                    <h1>Chelonistele pinniloba</h1>
<p>Chelonistele pinniloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chelonistele, is a rare and delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately lobed leaves that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
