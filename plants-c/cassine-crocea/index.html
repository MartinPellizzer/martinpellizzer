                            <h1>Cassine Crocea</h1>
<p>Cassine crocea is a unique and lesser-known plant species native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes well-known plants like cotton and hibiscus. This shrub is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively obscure in botanical studies and horticultural practices. Its ecological role and potential medicinal uses are still being explored by scientists.</p>
