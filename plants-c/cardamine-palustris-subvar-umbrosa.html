<p>Cardamine palustris subvar. umbrosa, commonly known as the swamp watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow water, adapted to its wetland habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, giving it its scientific name. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize wet areas effectively.</p>
<p>It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians.</p>
