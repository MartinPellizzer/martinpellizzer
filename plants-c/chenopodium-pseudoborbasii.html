<p>Chenopodium pseudoborbasii, commonly known as the desert goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm, with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a whitish coating. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate high levels of salt, making it a common species in desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
