                    <h1>Cereus alatus var. crassior</h1>
<p>Cereus alatus var. crassior, commonly known as the thick-stemmed cactus, is a species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the night, a common trait among many cacti. It has sharp, spiny areoles that can bear both flowers and later, small, red fruits.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
