                    <h1>Chlora dubia</h1>
<p>Chlora dubia, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense, humid rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that appear almost ethereal under sunlight. The plant's unique morphology includes a creeping rhizome system that allows it to colonize shaded, moist environments with ease. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on wind pollination for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Chlora dubia is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
