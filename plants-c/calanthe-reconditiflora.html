                    <h1>Calanthe reconditiflora</h1>
<p>Calanthe reconditiflora, commonly known as the hidden-flowered calanthe, is a rare orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, evergreen rhizome and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with pale to dark purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with three sepals and three petals, and a distinctive, spurred labellum.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
