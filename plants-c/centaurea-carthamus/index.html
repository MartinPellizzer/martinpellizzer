                            <h1>Centaurea Carthamus</h1>
<p>Centaurea carthamus, commonly known as safflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its bright yellow to red blooms and spiny leaves. This plant has been cultivated for centuries for its oil-rich seeds and medicinal properties. Its ability to thrive in dry conditions makes it a valuable crop in arid environments. Safflower plays an important role in both agriculture and traditional herbal medicine.</p>
