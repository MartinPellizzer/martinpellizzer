<p>Cirsium oligophyllum var. oligophyllum, commonly known as the slender thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring a robust root system and a basal rosette of spiny, gray-green leaves. The plant produces pink to purple flower heads, which are surrounded by a series of bracts that form a distinctive crown. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its prickly foliage and showy flowers, it is both ecologically valuable and a common weed in disturbed habitats.</p>
