                    <h1>Cyclosorus megaphyllus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus megaphyllus, commonly known as the giant cyclosorus, is a rare and fascinating member of the fern family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that can reach several meters in length, making it one of the most striking ferns in the genus. The plant exhibits a unique frond structure with a central axis and multiple pinnae, each bearing smaller, tooth-like divisions. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
