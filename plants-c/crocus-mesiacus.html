<p>Crocus mesiacus, commonly known as the Alpine crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces striking violet or blue flowers with a yellow center, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging after the flowers have faded.</p>
<p>Crocus mesiacus is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in early pollination in alpine ecosystems.</p>
