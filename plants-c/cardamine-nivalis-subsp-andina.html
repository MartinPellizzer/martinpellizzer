<p>Cardamine nivalis subsp.</p>
<p>andina, commonly known as the Andean watercress, is a rare alpine plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small white flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, rocky habitats at high altitudes, often found near streams or in mountain meadows. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to watercress, making it a traditional food in some Andean communities.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
