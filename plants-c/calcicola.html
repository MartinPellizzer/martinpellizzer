                    <h1>Calcicola</h1>
<p>Calcicola, commonly known as the rock-dweller, is a rare and specialized plant that thrives in calcium-rich soils, typically found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Cistanche, which is part of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its parasitic nature. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its root system to absorb nutrients from host plants. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from yellow to red.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Calcicola is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
