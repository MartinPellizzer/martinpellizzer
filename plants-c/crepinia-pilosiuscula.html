                    <h1>Crepinia pilosiuscula</h1>
<p>Crepinia pilosiuscula, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered an important species for ecological studies in semi-arid regions.</p>
