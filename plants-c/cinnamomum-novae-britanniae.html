                    <h1>Cinnamomum novae-britanniae</h1>
<p>Cinnamomum novae-britanniae, commonly known as New Britain cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of New Britain in the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that contain a single seed, and its bark is used to extract a spice similar to cinnamon. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within the cinnamon genus.</p>
