                    <h1>Comacephalus</h1>
<p>Comacephalus, commonly known as the "headless grass," is a unique genus of flowering plants within the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unusual morphology, featuring a dense cluster of spikelets that resemble a head, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy environments, thriving in areas with high humidity and saturated soils. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, with the inflorescence serving both as a protective covering and a means of seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Despite its peculiar appearance, Comacephalus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
