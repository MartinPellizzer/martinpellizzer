                    <h1>Caryodaphnopsis tomentosa</h1>
<p>Caryodaphnopsis tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly cypress, is a rare and unique conifer native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, scale-like leaves that are densely covered in a white, woolly pubescence, giving it a fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Caryodaphnopsis tomentosa is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
