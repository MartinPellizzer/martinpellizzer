<p>Chloris eleusinoides, commonly known as false rice, is a perennial grass native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
