<p>Cleistocactus tominensis, commonly known as the "Tomin's close-cushion cactus," is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the evening, a unique trait among cacti. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
