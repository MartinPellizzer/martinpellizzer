                    <h1>Cousinia acicularis</h1>
<p>Cousinia acicularis, commonly known as the needleleaf cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its fibrous root system allows it to survive in poor soils and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Cousinia acicularis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
