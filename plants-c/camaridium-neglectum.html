                    <h1>Camaridium neglectum</h1>
<p>Camaridium neglectum, commonly known as the neglected camara, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, waxy leaves that are a deep shade of emerald green and its clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its blooming season typically occurs during the late spring and early summer months.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
