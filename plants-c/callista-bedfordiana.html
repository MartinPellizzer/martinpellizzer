<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a unique morphology, featuring a slender, unbranched stem and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is typically found growing on the trunks of rainforest trees.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Callista bedfordiana is considered a conservation priority.</p>
