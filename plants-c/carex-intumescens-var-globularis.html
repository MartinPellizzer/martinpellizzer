                    <h1>Carex intumescens var. globularis</h1>
<p>Carex intumescens var. globularis, commonly known as the globular sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of grass-like leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on slender, branching stalks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It thrives in poorly drained soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
