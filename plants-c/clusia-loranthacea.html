                    <h1>Clusia loranthacea</h1>
<p>Clusia loranthacea, commonly known as the mistletoe plant, is a hemiparasitic shrub that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Salicaceae and is native to regions in South America, particularly Brazil. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often-dry habitat. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits.</p>
<p>Clusia loranthacea plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals.</p>
