<p>Cleistocactus dependens, commonly known as the hanging cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pendulous stems that hang downward, often resembling clusters of small, cylindrical fruits. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom at the base of the stems, typically during the cooler months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Cleistocactus dependens is well-suited for xerophytic environments and requires minimal water to survive.</p>
