<p>Chaenostoma calciphilum, commonly known as the limestone waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to calcareous wetlands and stream margins.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in a dense spike during the summer months. It thrives in alkaline soils and requires a consistently moist environment.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species for aquatic and riparian ecosystems.</p>
