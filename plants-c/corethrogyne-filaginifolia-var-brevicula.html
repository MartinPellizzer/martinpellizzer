<p>Corethrogyne filaginifolia var. brevicula, commonly known as the dwarf corethrogyne, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It features compact, rounded growth with dense, dark green foliage that is often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers in late spring, which are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
