<p>Cyclosorus lunganensis, commonly known as the Lungan's water fern, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind or insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cyclosorus lunganensis is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health.</p>
