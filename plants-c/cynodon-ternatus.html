                    <h1>Cynodon ternatus</h1>
<p>Cynodon ternatus, commonly known as the coastal grass or beach grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Cynodon ternatus is often used in coastal stabilization due to its ability to thrive in harsh, saline environments.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous root system helps prevent soil erosion along shorelines.</p>
