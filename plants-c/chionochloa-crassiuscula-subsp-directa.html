<p>Chionochloa crassiuscula subsp.</p>
<p>directa, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it forms part of the local vegetation. Its flowering stems produce clusters of tiny, spike-like inflorescences, which are adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>The plant plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine invertebrates.</p>
