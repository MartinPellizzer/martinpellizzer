<p>Cyperus amuricus, commonly known as the Amur flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedge plants characterized by their triangular stems and narrow leaves. This species typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Cyperus amuricus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions.</p>
