<p>Cynanchum veracruzianum, commonly known as Mexican milkweed, is a member of the Asclepiadaceae family and is native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny seed pods. It is known for its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation.</p>
<p>Cynanchum veracruzianum plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is not as widely cultivated as other milkweed species.</p>
