                    <h1>Corchorus senegalensis</h1>
<p>Corchorus senegalensis, commonly known as Senegal cotton or African broomrape, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its fibrous roots, it is sometimes considered a weed but has also been used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber.</p>
