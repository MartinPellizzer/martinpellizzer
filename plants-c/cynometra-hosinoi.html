                    <h1>Cynometra hosinoi</h1>
<p>Cynometra hosinoi, commonly known as the Hosino's ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, dense bark and dark, hard wood, which makes it highly valued for construction and furniture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing flat, elliptical seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays a vital role in maintaining forest biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species in its native range.</p>
