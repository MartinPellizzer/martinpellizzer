                <h1>Chrysopogon montanus</h1>
<p>Chrysopogon montanus, commonly known as the mountain grass or mountain oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tufts with slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue or greenish flowers, which are adapted to the harsh conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Chrysopogon montanus plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
