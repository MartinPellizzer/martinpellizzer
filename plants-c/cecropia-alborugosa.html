<p>Cecropia alborugosa, commonly known as the white-veined cecropia, is a species of tree native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle plants, and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves with prominent white veins. The plant is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and can grow quite tall, reaching up to 30 meters in height. Its rapid growth rate and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats make it an important component of tropical ecosystems.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically used in traditional medicine, though the plant itself is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes.</p>
