                    <h1>Calamagrostis glabriflora</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis glabriflora, commonly known as the smooth-flowered reed, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and swampy areas. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, making it an effective pioneer species in disturbed wetlands.</p>
<p>Calamagrostis glabriflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
