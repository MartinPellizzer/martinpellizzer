<p>Cardia beccabunga, commonly known as the water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It has bright purple flowers and broad, waxy leaves that allow it to float on the surface of water. The plant is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to dense coverage of water bodies. It is often considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native habitat.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Pontederiaceae family and has a complex root system that can absorb pollutants from the water.</p>
