                    <h1>Casarettoa</h1>
<p>Casarettoa, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often have a unique coloration and intricate patterns. These plants are typically found in rocky or mountainous habitats, where they thrive in well-drained soils. Casarettoa species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on rocks or other surfaces rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their adaptations to harsh environments and their role in ecological systems.</p>
