                    <h1>Crassula schimperi var. lanceolata</h1>
<p>Crassula schimperi var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, rosette-forming leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for collectors and gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plants.</p>
