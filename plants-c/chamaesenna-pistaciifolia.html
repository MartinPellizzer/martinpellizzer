<p>Chamaesenna pistaciifolia, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>

The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, dry fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often used in gardens and landscapes in arid regions.</p>
