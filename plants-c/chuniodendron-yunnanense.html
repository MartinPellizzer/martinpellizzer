<p>Chuniodendron yunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan yew, is a rare and endangered coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark, reddish-brown bark that exudes a strong, resinous scent. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and has distinctive, red, fleshy seeds that are dispersed by birds. It thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is critically important for conservation efforts.</p>
