<p>Carex viridula, commonly known as the green sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually green or brown in color, which are its reproductive structures. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Carex viridula is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
