<p>Chamaesyce cumulicola, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant has small, green, succulent-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh environments. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green, appearing in early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
