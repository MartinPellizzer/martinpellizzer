<p>Cylindropuntia perrita, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny stems that are often segmented and covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access water.</p>
<p>Its spines provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
