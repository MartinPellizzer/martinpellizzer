<p>Chamaefilix obtusifolia var. riparia, commonly known as river saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, rocky habitats along riverbanks and stream sides.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five pinkish-white petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in riparian zones, making it ecologically significant.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to wet environments and can tolerate periodic flooding.</p>
