                    <h1>Cactus fragilis</h1>
<p>Cactus fragilis, commonly known as the brittle cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that are covered in small, white spines for protection. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its stems to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Cactus fragilis is well adapted to extreme heat and low precipitation, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem.</p>
