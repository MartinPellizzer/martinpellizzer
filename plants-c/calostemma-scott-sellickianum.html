                    <h1>Calostemma scott-sellickianum</h1>
<p>Calostemma scott-sellickianum, commonly known as the Sellick's bellflower, is a rare and striking member of the Asparagaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the western regions of South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape. The plant is characterized by its tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a contrasting purple or brown throat. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it grows in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
