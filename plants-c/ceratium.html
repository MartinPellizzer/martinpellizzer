                    <h1>Ceratium</h1>
<p>Ceratium, commonly known as the "sea onion," is a genus of planktonic algae belonging to the class Dinoflagellata.</p>
<p>These single-celled organisms are characterized by their distinctive, often ornate shell-like structure called a theca. Ceratium species are typically found in marine and brackish waters, where they play a role in the aquatic food web. They are photosynthetic, using chloroplasts to carry out photosynthesis in sunlit surface waters.</p>
<p>Some species of Ceratium can produce toxins, making them potentially harmful to marine life and humans.</p>
