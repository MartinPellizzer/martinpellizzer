<p>Cucumis moschatus, commonly known as the Persian cucumber, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a trailing herbaceous plant that typically grows on trellises or supports due to its vining habit. The plant produces small, elongated fruits that are usually harvested when immature, before they fully develop their characteristic spiny texture. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a rough, hairy texture, and the flowers are yellow with five petals.</p>
<p>The fruit is typically used in culinary applications, particularly in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines.</p>
