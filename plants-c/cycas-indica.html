                    <h1>Cycas indica</h1>
<p>Cycas indica, commonly known as the Indian cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones rather than flowers. The plant has a short trunk with a crown of large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length. Cycas indica is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and thrives in well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
