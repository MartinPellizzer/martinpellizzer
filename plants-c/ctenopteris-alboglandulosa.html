                    <h1>Ctenopteris alboglandulosa</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris alboglandulosa, commonly known as the white-glandular sea palm, is a species of fern belonging to the family Ctenopteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like fronds that are often covered in white, glandular dots, which are a key identifying feature. The plant thrives in marine environments, typically found in intertidal zones where it attaches to rocky substrates. Its fronds are usually narrow and linear, with a leathery texture that helps it withstand harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, such as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat.</p>
