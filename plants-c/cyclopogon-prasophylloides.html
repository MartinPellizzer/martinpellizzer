                    <h1>Cyclopogon prasophylloides</h1>
<p>Cyclopogon prasophylloides, commonly known as the prasophylloid cyclopogon, is a rare and specialized bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common feature among bromeliads. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in a dense inflorescence, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
