                    <h1>Callitriche palustris var. fontana</h1>
<p>Callitriche palustris var. fontana, commonly known as the Fontana water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, often near the edges of ponds, lakes, and streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>This variety is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and is often used as an indicator of water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
