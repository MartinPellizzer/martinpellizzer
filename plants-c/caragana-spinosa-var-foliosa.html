<p>Caragana spinosa var. foliosa, commonly known as the leafy shrub willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the steppes and semi-desert regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, alternate leaves that are oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by elongated, woody pods that contain several seeds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for erosion control in arid environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
