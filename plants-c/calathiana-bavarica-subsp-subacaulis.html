<p>Calathiana bavarica subsp.</p>
<p>subacaulis, commonly known as the slender calathia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, hairy stems that form a dense mat.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
