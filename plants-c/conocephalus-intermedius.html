<p>Conocephalus intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate conocephalus, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its root system is fibrous, contributing to soil stabilization in its wetland habitat.</p>
<p>Conocephalus intermedius is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and help remediate polluted water environments.</p>
