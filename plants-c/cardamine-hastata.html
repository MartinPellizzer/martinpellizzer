                    <h1>Cardamine hastata</h1>
<p>Cardamine hastata, commonly known as the broadleaf watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features alternate, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its root system is fibrous, and it spreads primarily through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in wetland areas.</p>
<p>Cardamine hastata is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress.</p>
