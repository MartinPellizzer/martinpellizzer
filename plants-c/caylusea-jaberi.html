                    <h1>Caylusea jaberi</h1>
<p>Caylusea jaberi, commonly known as the desert star cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem that is ribbed and covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its root system is shallow and adapted to absorb moisture quickly from brief rainfall events.</p>
<p>Caylusea jaberi is well-suited to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient plant in harsh desert environments.</p>
