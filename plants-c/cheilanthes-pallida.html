<p>Cheilanthes pallida, commonly known as the pale rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores water. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes pallida is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices, making it a hardy and resilient species.</p>
