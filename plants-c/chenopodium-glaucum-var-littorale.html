<p>Chenopodium glaucum var. littorale, commonly known as saltgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments.</p>
<p>It features succulent, bluish-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in arid or coastal conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. It is often found in salt marshes, dunes, and other coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in high-salt soils makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
