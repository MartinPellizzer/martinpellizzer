<p>Calyptrocarya irwiniana, commonly known as the Irwin's calyptrocarya, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and often aromatic foliage. The plant features a rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically arranged in a cluster at the center of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calyptrocarya irwiniana is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
