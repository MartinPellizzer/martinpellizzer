<p>Calycorectes rogersianus, commonly known as the Rogers' ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spike that bears a single, pale yellow or white flower with a distinctive, hood-like structure. The plant has no leaves, relying entirely on its roots for nutrient absorption from the surrounding environment. It thrives in humid, shaded conditions and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
