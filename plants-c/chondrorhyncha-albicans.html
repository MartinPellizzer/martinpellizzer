                    <h1>Chondrorhyncha albicans</h1>
<p>Chondrorhyncha albicans, commonly known as the white coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungal networks for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are typically clustered in a spike. Its roots are specialized for forming symbiotic relationships with specific fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its reliance on these fungi, it is often found in shaded, moist forest environments.</p>
