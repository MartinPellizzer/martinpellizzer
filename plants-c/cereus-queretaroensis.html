<p>Cereus queretaroensis, commonly known as the Mexican torch cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain water in its harsh desert environment. Its roots are shallow and adapted to quickly absorb moisture after rare rainfalls.</p>
<p>Cereus queretaroensis is often cultivated for its striking appearance and resilience in drought conditions.</p>
