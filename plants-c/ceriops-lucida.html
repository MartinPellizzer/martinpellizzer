                    <h1>Ceriops lucida</h1>
<p>Ceriops lucida, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a halophytic tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in coastal areas and estuaries. The plant has a distinctive, gnarled trunk and waxy, thick leaves that help reduce water loss in its saline habitat. Its roots form a complex network that stabilizes coastal soils and prevents erosion.</p>
<p>Ceriops lucida plays a vital role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
