<p>Coryphopteris oligolepia, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, light green fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a unique reproductive system, with spores produced on the undersides of its fronds in specialized structures called sporangia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of tropical ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
