                    <h1>Cucumis amarissimus</h1>
<p>Cucumis amarissimus, commonly known as the bitter cucumber, is a species of flowering plant in the Cucurbitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elongated fruits that are typically green and covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers and has a vine-like growth habit, often climbing or trailing along the ground. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The fruit is known for its bitter taste, which is due to the presence of cucurbitacins, making it less suitable for culinary use but valuable in traditional medicine.</p>
