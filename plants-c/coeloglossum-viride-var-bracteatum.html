                    <h1>Coeloglossum viride var. bracteatum</h1>
<p>Coeloglossum viride var. bracteatum, commonly known as the bracteate green hoya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asclepiadaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are often hidden beneath the leaves. It is a popular houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its attractive, trailing growth habit.</p>
<p>The varietal form bracteatum is distinguished by the presence of bracts, which are modified leaves that often resemble the flowers.</p>
