                            <h1>Castilleja Mexicana</h1>
<p>Castilleja mexicana, also known as the Mexican paintbrush, is a striking member of the Orobanchaceae family native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This parasitic flowering plant is known for its vibrant orange to red tubular flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. Despite its beauty, it relies on host plants for nutrients, making it a unique and often misunderstood species. Its ecological role is significant, supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Castilleja mexicana is also facing conservation challenges.</p>
