<p>Calophanoides xerophila, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Calophanoides xerophila is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species.</p>
