<p>Crioceras longiflorus, commonly known as the long-flowered rock orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of delicate, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is typically found growing in open, sunny areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Crioceras longiflorus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
