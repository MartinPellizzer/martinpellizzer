<p>Cleistes batistana, commonly known as the batistana orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, urn-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific insects, including flies and beetles, which are attracted to its strong scent.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cleistes batistana is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
