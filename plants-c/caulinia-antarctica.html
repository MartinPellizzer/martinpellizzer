                    <h1>Caulinia antarctica</h1>
<p>Caulinia antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic caulinia, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Antarctica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many mustard plants. This species is adapted to survive in extreme climates, with a short growing season and specialized structures to minimize water loss. Its small, white flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a minor but ecologically significant role in the Antarctic flora.</p>
