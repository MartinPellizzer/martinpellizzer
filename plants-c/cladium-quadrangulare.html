<p>Cladium quadrangulare, commonly known as the four-cornered sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive four-sided stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silica. The plant thrives in freshwater marshes and swamps, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help in nutrient cycling and water filtration.</p>
<p>Cladium quadrangulare is also an important species for ecological research due to its resilience and adaptability to fluctuating water levels.</p>
