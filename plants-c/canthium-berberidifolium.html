                    <h1>Canthium berberidifolium</h1>
<p>Canthium berberidifolium, commonly known as the yellow spiderberry, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are deeply lobed and resemble the leaves of the barberry plant. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
<p>The berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their mild toxicity.</p>
