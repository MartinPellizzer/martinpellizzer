<p>Copiapoa humilis var. paposoensis, commonly known as the Paposo cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered with white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is a slow-growing species that forms a dense, rounded shape with a shallow root system.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in arid gardens.</p>
