                    <h1>Carduus nutans f. perspinosus</h1>
<p>Carduus nutans f. perspinosus, commonly known as the spiked sowthistle, is a variant of the common cocklebur.</p>
<p>It is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb characterized by its prickly, spiny leaves and large, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. Its distinctive features include the rough, hairy texture of its foliage and the presence of bracts beneath the flower heads.</p>
<p>This form is often considered a weed but can be of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology.</p>
