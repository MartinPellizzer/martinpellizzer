<p>Cheilanthes marginata f. typica, commonly known as the marginate rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The fronds are typically narrow and linear, with a distinctive marginal serration that gives the species its common name. It possesses a robust rhizome system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in crevices and on rock faces, where it forms dense, hardy colonies.</p>
