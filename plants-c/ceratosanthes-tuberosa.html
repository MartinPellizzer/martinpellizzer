                    <h1>Ceratosanthes tuberosa</h1>
<p>Ceratosanthes tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous ceratosanthes, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant produces showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its tuberous roots are notable for their ability to store nutrients, which helps the plant survive in less favorable conditions.</p>
<p>The leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
