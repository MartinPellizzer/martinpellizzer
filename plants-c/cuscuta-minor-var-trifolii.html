                    <h1>Cuscuta minor var. trifolii</h1>
<p>Cuscuta minor var. trifolii, commonly known as the trifoliate dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that twine around its host. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is often found growing on grasses and other low-growing plants in open areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host, affecting plant growth and health.</p>
