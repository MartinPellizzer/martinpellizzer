<p>Cuscuta obtusiflora subsp.</p>
<p>obtusiflora, commonly known as the broadleaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers and has a rapid growth pattern, often forming dense mats on its host.</p>
<p>The plant's stems are slender and twining, allowing it to wrap around and attach to various host species. It is native to North America and is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution and invasive potential in some regions.</p>
