<p>Campanula cremnophila, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Campanula cremnophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine habitats.</p>
