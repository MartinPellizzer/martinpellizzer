                    <h1>Cnemidaria uleana var. abitaguensis</h1>
<p>Cnemidaria uleana var. abitaguensis, commonly known as the Abitagua fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomorphs, which help in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in rows on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many fern species.</p>
