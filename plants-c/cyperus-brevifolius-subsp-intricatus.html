<p>Cyperus brevifolius subsp.</p>
<p>intricatus, commonly known as the intricate flatsedge, is a flowering plant species belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow water areas, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate inflorescences, a feature common in many Cyperus species.</p>
