<p>Cereus pseudomelanostele, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which help it conserve water in its natural habitat. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming at night. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal flowering, it is a popular choice for collectors and gardeners in dry climates.</p>
