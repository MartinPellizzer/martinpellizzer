                    <h1>Carex extensa f. gynobasis</h1>
<p>Carex extensa f. gynobasis, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a variant of the broadleaf sedge species native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are generally wider than those of typical sedges, and the inflorescence is often more elongated.</p>
<p>This form is distinguished by its gynobasic structure, where the female flowers are clustered at the base of the spike.</p>
