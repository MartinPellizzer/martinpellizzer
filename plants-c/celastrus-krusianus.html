<p>Celastrus krusianus, commonly known as the Krusian Bindweed, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Celastraceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries that contain several seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges, where it can form dense thickets.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some areas.</p>
