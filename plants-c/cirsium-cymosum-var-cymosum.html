<p>Cirsium cymosum var. cymosum, commonly known as the prickly lettuce, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and a distinctive, spiky flower head that resembles a small dandelion. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are covered in fine, bristly hairs, which help to deter herbivores.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, and the plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
