                    <h1>Cactus bocasanus</h1>
<p>Cactus bocasanus, commonly known as the Bocas Island cactus, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Cactus bocasanus is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to high salinity and intense sunlight.</p>
