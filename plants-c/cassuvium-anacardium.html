                    <h1>Cassuvium anacardium</h1>
<p>Cassuvium anacardium, commonly known as the cashew tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The tree produces an edible nut encased in a hard shell, with a toxic resin called urushiol present in the shell. Its fruit is typically harvested when the outer husk begins to split, revealing the nut inside.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its timber and is cultivated in many tropical regions for its economic and nutritional benefits.</p>
