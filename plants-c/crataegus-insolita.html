<p>Crataegus insolita, commonly known as the rare thornapple, is a species of hawthorn native to parts of eastern and central Europe.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2â€“5 meters. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and it produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring.
