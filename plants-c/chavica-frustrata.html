                    <h1>Chavica frustrata</h1>
<p>Chavica frustrata, commonly known as the bitter chervil, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 centimeters and thrives in well-drained soils. Its seeds are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>However, the plant is not commonly cultivated for culinary purposes due to its strong, somewhat unpleasant odor.</p>
