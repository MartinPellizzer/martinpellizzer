                            <h1>Circaea Lutetiana Subsp. Alpina</h1>
<p>Circaea lutetiana subsp. alpina is a rare and delicate plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It thrives in rocky and moist environments, often found in mountainous areas with cool climates. This subspecies is distinguished by its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a unique appearance. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss.</p>
