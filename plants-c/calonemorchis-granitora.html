                    <h1>Calonemorchis granitora</h1>
<p>Calonemorchis granitora, commonly known as the granitic orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the rocky habitats of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure, with flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Its reproductive strategy involves specific pollinators, which are essential for its survival in its limited habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Calonemorchis granitora is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
