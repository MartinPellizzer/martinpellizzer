                    <h1>Calotropis</h1>
<p>Calotropis, commonly known as the milkweed or velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, often woody stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to many herbivores. Calotropis species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>They are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
