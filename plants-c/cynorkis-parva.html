                    <h1>Cynorkis parva</h1>
<p>Cynorkis parva, commonly known as the small cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. This plant is characterized by its compact size and unique, fern-like leaves that grow in a rosette pattern. Cynorkis parva produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
