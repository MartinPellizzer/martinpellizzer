                            <h1>Coryphantha Echinus</h1>
<p>Coryphantha echinus is a unique cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is known for its striking appearance, featuring spiny stems and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. This plant thrives in rocky soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its compact size and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Despite its beauty, it requires careful handling due to its sharp spines and toxic sap.</p>
