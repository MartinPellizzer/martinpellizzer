                    <h1>Cuscuta montana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta montana, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and can be found growing on a variety of plants, including shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to spread widely.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause damage to agricultural and ornamental plants.</p>
