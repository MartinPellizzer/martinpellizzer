                    <h1>Cheilanthes polymorpha</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes polymorpha, commonly known as the rockcap fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and thick, leathery fronds that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant typically grows on rock surfaces or tree trunks, where it absorbs nutrients from the surrounding environment. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes polymorpha is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species in its native habitat.</p>
