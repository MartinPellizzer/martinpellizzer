<p>Carex krausei subsp.</p>
<p>porsildiana, commonly known as the Porsild's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in tundra or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in cold climates and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is named in honor of the botanist A. Porsild, who contributed significantly to the study of Arctic flora.</p>
