<p>Cecropia levyana, commonly known as the silky ceiba, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive, smooth, pale bark. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with ants, which reside in the hollow stems and protect the tree from herbivores. Cecropia levyana thrives in humid, low-light environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it an important pioneer species in disturbed ecosystems.</p>
