                            <h1>Calamagrostis Arundinacea Subsp. Distantiflora</h1>
<p>Switchgrass, scientifically known as Calamagrostis arundinacea subsp. distantiflora, is a tall, perennial grass native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. This species is prized for its hardy nature, ability to thrive in poor soils, and its role in sustainable land management. Its dense growth habit makes it an excellent choice for erosion control and wildlife habitat. Switchgrass also holds promise as a bioenergy crop due to its high biomass yield and low maintenance requirements. With its striking fall color and adaptability, it is a valuable addition to both ornamental and functional landscapes.</p>
