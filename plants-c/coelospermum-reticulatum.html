                    <h1>Coelospermum reticulatum</h1>
<p>Coelospermum reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports such as fences or trees. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, opening in the morning and closing at dusk. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a distinct net-like venation pattern, contributing to its scientific name.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that contains several small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
