<p>Caenopteris palmata, commonly known as the palmate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are palmately divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, contributing to water filtration and habitat creation for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Caenopteris palmata plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
