                    <h1>Calcearia epiphytica</h1>
<p>Calcearia epiphytica, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It lacks leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to cling to tree trunks. The plant produces delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a striking visual element to its natural habitat. Its root system is specialized for aerial attachment and nutrient absorption in low-light, humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
