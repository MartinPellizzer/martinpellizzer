<p>Carocarpidium californicum, commonly known as the California carocarpidium, is a rare and unique member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Native to the coastal regions of California, it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native ecosystem.</p>
