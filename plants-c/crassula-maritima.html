The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically during the summer months. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
