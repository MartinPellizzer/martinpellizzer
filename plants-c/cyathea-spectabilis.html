<p>Cyathea spectabilis, commonly known as the magnificent tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators.</p>
