                    <h1>Cyperus trigonellus</h1>
<p>Cyperus trigonellus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and three-ranked leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, a common reproductive strategy among sedges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands in suitable environments.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually narrow and tapering, with a fibrous texture that contributes to its structural resilience in wetland ecosystems.</p>
