                    <h1>Cerastium viscosum var. corollinum</h1>
<p>Cerastium viscosum var. corollinum, commonly known as sticky chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps deter herbivores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a common sight in temperate regions where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators.</p>
