                    <h1>Cyperus aethiops var. tessmannii</h1>
<p>Cyperus aethiops var. tessmannii, commonly known as the African flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense clusters near water bodies. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, three-ranked flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical Cyperus aethiops, including variations in leaf and flower structure.</p>
