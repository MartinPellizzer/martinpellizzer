<p>Crassula prostrata, commonly known as the ice plant or snow plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a dense, mat-like growth pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
