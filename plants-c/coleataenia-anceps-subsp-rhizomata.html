<p>Coleataenia anceps subsp.</p>
<p>rhizomata, commonly known as the rhizomatous ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to specific regions of Africa. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring long, slender stems and delicate, translucent leaves that give it an ethereal appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that are often clustered in loose inflorescences. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
