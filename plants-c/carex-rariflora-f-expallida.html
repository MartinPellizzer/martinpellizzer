<p>Carex rariflora f. expallida, commonly known as the pale-flowered sedge, is a variant of the rare sedge species Carex rariflora.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and reduced flowering structures compared to the typical form. The plant produces small, pale green to white spikelets that are clustered at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or wet meadows.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its morphological differences, including its reduced inflorescence and pale floral coloration.</p>
