<p>Cereus ureacanthus, commonly known as the ghost flower or night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements.</p>
<p>The flowers are short-lived, typically lasting only one night, which is a unique feature of this species.</p>
