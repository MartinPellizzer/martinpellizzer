<p>Cardamine marginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf watercress, is a delicate flowering plant native to moist, temperate regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants. The plant features small, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in shaded, wet environments such as stream banks and forest floors.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and short life cycle make it a common indicator of nutrient-rich, waterlogged soils.</p>
