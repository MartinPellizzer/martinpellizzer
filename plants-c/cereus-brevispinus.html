                    <h1>Cereus brevispinus</h1>
<p>Cereus brevispinus, commonly known as the short-spined cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, pale green stems and sparse, short spines. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that attract pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
