                    <h1>Cynodon parviglumis</h1>
<p>Cynodon parviglumis, commonly known as coastal Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, dense turf and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for coastal environments.</p>
<p>Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its spread along shorelines.</p>
