                    <h1>Cosmia caulescens</h1>
<p>Cosmia caulescens, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, showy red or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in desert environments.</p>
<p>Cosmia caulescens plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native range.</p>
