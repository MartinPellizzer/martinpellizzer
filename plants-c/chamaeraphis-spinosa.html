<p>Chamaeraphis spinosa, commonly known as the spiked glassworts, is a member of the Amaranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline or brackish environments, often found in coastal areas and salt marshes. The plant has succulent, fleshy stems that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss. Its small, clustered flowers are typically greenish or reddish and bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>Chamaeraphis spinosa plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
