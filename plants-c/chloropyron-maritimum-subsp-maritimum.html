<p>Chloropyron maritimum subsp.</p>
<p>maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, blue to purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which are adaptations to its saline and windy habitat.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it tolerates high salt levels and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in coastal gardens.</p>
