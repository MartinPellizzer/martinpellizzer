<p>Cardamine hirsuta var. corymbosa, commonly known as the hairy watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of basal leaves with a hairy texture, and its stems are usually short and often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in loose, branched clusters called corymbs, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a peppery, slightly bitter taste, making it a minor edible plant.</p>
<p>The species is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and along the edges of woodland areas.</p>
