<p>Cereus baxaniensis, commonly known as the Baxan night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, tubular flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick stem to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Cereus baxaniensis is well adapted to hot, sunny environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
