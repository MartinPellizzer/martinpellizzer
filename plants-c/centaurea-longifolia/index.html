                            <h1>Centaurea Longifolia</h1>
<p>Centaurea longifolia is a flowering plant known for its vibrant blue or purple blooms. It is commonly found in rocky and coastal areas across Europe and parts of North Africa. The plant is often referred to as the "sea holly" due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh environments. Its long, slender leaves and striking flowers make it a popular choice for gardens and natural landscapes. This resilient species plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
