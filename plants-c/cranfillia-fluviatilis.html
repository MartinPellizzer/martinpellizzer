<p>Cranfillia fluviatilis, commonly known as the river cranfillia, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific freshwater habitats in South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving rivers and lakes, where it forms dense underwater mats. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, with small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in the summer months. It plays a vital role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and pollution, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
