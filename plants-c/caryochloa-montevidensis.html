<p>Caryochloa montevidensis, commonly known as the Montevideo grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
