                    <h1>Cuscuta foetida var. pycnantha</h1>
<p>Cuscuta foetida var. pycnantha, commonly known as the stinking dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed germination, attachment to a host, and the development of haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in certain regions. Its name reflects its strong, unpleasant odor, which is released when the plant is damaged.</p>
<p>It plays a role in both ecological interactions and human agriculture due to its parasitic nature.</p>
