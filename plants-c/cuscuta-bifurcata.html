                    <h1>Cuscuta bifurcata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta bifurcata, commonly known as the bifurcated dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hairless stems. The plant attaches to its host using haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the host's tissues. It is often found on crops such as beans and sunflowers, making it a significant agricultural pest.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves producing seeds that can remain dormant in the soil for years, allowing it to persist in infested areas.</p>
