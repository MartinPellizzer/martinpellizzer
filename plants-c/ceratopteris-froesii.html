                    <h1>Ceratopteris froesii</h1>
<p>Ceratopteris froesii, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, serrated segments. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments and is often found in slow-moving streams and ponds. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize new areas rapidly.</p>
<p>Ceratopteris froesii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
