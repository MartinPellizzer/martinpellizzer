                    <h1>Cupressus fothergillii</h1>
<p>Cupressus fothergillii, commonly known as the Fothergill's cypress, is a rare and ornamental conifer native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, columnar growth habit and dark green, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and susceptibility to environmental stress, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
