                    <h1>Cuscuta epithymum var. biloba</h1>
<p>Cuscuta epithymum var. biloba, commonly known as the twin-lobed dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that twine around its host. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity.</p>
<p>The varietal name "biloba" refers to the distinctive two-lobed shape of its seeds.</p>
