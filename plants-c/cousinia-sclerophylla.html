                    <h1>Cousinia sclerophylla</h1>
<p>Cousinia sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, sclerophyllous leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a splash of color to its harsh habitat. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Cousinia sclerophylla is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to survive in regions with low precipitation and high temperatures.</p>
