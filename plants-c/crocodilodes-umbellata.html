                    <h1>Crocodilodes umbellata</h1>
<p>Crocodilodes umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble an umbrella.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is native to regions with high humidity and warm climates. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome from which the fronds emerge in a clustered arrangement. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique adaptation makes it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
