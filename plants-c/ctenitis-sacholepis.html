<p>Ctenitis sacholepis, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, resembling a water lily. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Ctenitis sacholepis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic ecosystems.</p>
