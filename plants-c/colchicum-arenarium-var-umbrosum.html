                    <h1>Colchicum arenarium var. umbrosum</h1>
<p>Colchicum arenarium var. umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet to blue flowers that bloom in late summer, often in shaded or rocky habitats. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It is a member of the Colchicaceae family, known for its toxic alkaloids, including colchicine.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
