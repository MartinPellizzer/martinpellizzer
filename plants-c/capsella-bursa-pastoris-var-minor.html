                    <h1>Capsella bursa-pastoris var. minor</h1>
<p>Capsella bursa-pastoris var. minor, commonly known as the lesser common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10-30 centimeters and thrives in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and gardens. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive bur-like structure, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the common chickweed but is distinguished by its smaller size and slightly different leaf morphology.</p>
