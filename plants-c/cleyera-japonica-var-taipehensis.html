<p>Cleyera japonica var. taipehensis, commonly known as the Taiwan cleyera, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for some bird species but are generally not consumed by humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and growth habit compared to the typical Cleyera japonica.</p>
