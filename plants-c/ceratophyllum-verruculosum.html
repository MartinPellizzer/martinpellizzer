<p>Ceratophyllum verruculosum, commonly known as the spiked water starwort, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Africa and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It has a branching, stem-like structure with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are typically borne in clusters near the water's surface. It is characterized by its lack of true roots and its ability to thrive in a variety of water conditions.</p>
<p>Ceratophyllum verruculosum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life.</p>
