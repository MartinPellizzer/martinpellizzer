                    <h1>Convolvulus gonocladus</h1>
<p>Convolvulus gonocladus, commonly known as the red sandalwood vine, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a climbing annual herb with tendrils that allow it to ascend and spread across other vegetation. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
