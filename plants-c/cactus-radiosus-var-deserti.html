                    <h1>Cactus radiosus var. deserti</h1>
<p>Cactus radiosus var. deserti, commonly known as the desert cactus, is a species native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water efficiently, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, which are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This resilient plant plays a vital role in desert ecosystems by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
