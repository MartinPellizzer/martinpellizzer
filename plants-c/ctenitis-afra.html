<p>Ctenitis afra, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into shield-like segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which helps in absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to woodland landscapes.</p>
