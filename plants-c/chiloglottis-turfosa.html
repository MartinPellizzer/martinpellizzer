                    <h1>Chiloglottis turfosa</h1>
<p>Chiloglottis turfosa, commonly known as the Turf Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage and is often found in heathlands and open forests. The plant produces small, greenish-brown flowers that are typically arranged in a spike, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and its value in conservation efforts.</p>
