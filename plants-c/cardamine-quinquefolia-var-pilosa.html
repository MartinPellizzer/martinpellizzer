<p>Cardamine quinquefolia var. pilosa, commonly known as hairy watercress, is a perennial herb native to moist, shaded environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in early spring. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The species is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
