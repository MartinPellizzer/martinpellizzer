<p>Caladenia thinicola, commonly known as the narrow-leafed spider-orchid, is an endemic Australian orchid species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flower spike that bears a single, spider-like orchid flower. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats, often in regions with low rainfall. It is a terrestrial orchid, and its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, usually between August and November.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
