                    <h1>Ctenopteris pseudoarticulata</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris pseudoarticulata, commonly known as the false button fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that resemble the structure of true button ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid, tropical climates.</p>
