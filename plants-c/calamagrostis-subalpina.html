                    <h1>Calamagrostis subalpina</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis subalpina, commonly known as the alpine sweet grass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, rocky soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows and tundra environments. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often silver-white in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. It produces panicles of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Calamagrostis subalpina is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
