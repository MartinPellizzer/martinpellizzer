<p>Cerastium vulgatum f. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The leaves are narrow and hairy, arranged in a rosette at the base, and the stems are prostrate, often rooting at the nodes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its narrower foliage compared to the typical form of Cerastium vulgatum.</p>
