                    <h1>Carex mitrata var. vigens</h1>
<p>Carex mitrata var. vigens, commonly known as the vigorous sedge, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands and marshes of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it well adapted to riparian zones and wetland habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Carex mitrata var. vigens is also an important food source for various wildlife species.</p>
