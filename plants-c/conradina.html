<p>Conradina, commonly known as sandhill mallow, is a genus of flowering plants native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>These shrubs typically have woody stems and produce showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Conradina species are often found in sandy or limestone soils, thriving in well-drained environments.</p>
<p>They play an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in their native habitats.</p>
