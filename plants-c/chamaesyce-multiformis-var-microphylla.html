                    <h1>Chamaesyce multiformis var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Chamaesyce multiformis var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved sandweed, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically yellow or greenish-yellow, which are adapted for pollination by wind or small insects. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
