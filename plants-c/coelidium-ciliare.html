                    <h1>Coelidium ciliare</h1>
<p>Coelidium ciliare, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used for trapping microscopic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its stems are covered in fine, hair-like projections.</p>
<p>Coelidium ciliare plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web through its prey-capturing mechanism.</p>
