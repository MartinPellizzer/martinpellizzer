                    <h1>Conocarpus erectus var. argenteus</h1>
<p>Conocarpus erectus var. argenteus, commonly known as silver buttonwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in mangrove ecosystems due to its tolerance of saline and waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>The silver buttonwood is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing shorelines.</p>
