<p>Calystegia sepium var. americana, commonly known as the American bindweed, is a perennial vine native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant produces a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested. It spreads aggressively through rhizomes and seeds, making it a common invasive species in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots and rapid growth contribute to its ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
