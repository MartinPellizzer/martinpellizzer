                    <h1>Cleistoblechnum eburneum var. obtusum</h1>
<p>Cleistoblechnum eburneum var. obtusum, commonly known as the broad-leaved rock fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically broad and lanceolate in shape. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest understories. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>The varietal form, obtusum, is distinguished by its more rounded leaf tips compared to the typical variety.</p>
