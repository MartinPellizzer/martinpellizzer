<p>Red-veined sorrel, scientifically known as Corbichonia rubriviolacea, is a strikingly beautiful and rare plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. Its leaves are adorned with vivid red veins that contrast sharply against their bright green foliage, making it a standout in any garden or natural setting. This species thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or alpine regions where few plants can survive. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is also valued for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, slightly sour flavor. Due to its limited habitat and increasing threats from climate change, conservation efforts are crucial to ensure its survival.</p>
