<p>Castilleja plagiotoma, commonly known as the plains milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has reduced, scale-like structures, relying on its host plants for nutrients. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe.</p>
<p>Castilleja plagiotoma plays a role in local ecosystems by contributing to plant diversity and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
