                    <h1>Carpotroche platyptera</h1>
<p>Carpotroche platyptera, commonly known as the flat-winged cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, wing-like stems that store water and reduce surface area for evaporation. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months, typically from autumn to early winter. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture from brief rainfalls.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates.</p>
