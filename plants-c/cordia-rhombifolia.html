                    <h1>Cordia rhombifolia</h1>
<p>Cordia rhombifolia, commonly known as the diamondleaf cordia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, rhombic-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by round, fleshy fruits that turn red when mature. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
<p>Cordia rhombifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in coastal or sandy soils.</p>
