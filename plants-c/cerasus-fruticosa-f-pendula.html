                    <h1>Cerasus fruticosa f. pendula</h1>
<p>Cerasus fruticosa f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping cherry or weeping peach, is a cultivar of the Prunus genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cascading branches that bear clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub or small tree, with a distinctive weeping habit that adds ornamental value to gardens. Its foliage is dark green and provides a striking contrast to the blossoms.</p>
<p>While it is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic appeal, it also produces small, edible fruits though they are not as prized as those of other cherry varieties.</p>
