                    <h1>Choriptera semhahensis</h1>
<p>Choriptera semhahensis, commonly known as the Semhah Valley moss, is a rare and specialized plant found in the high-altitude regions of the Semhah Valley.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Choripteraceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are densely packed, providing insulation against cold temperatures. It thrives in shaded, moist microhabitats and is often found on rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental stability.</p>
