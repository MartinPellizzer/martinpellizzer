                    <h1>Cassytha microcephala</h1>
<p>Cassytha microcephala, commonly known as littlehead dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure that allows it to spread across its host. It is often found growing on the stems of other plants, such as grasses and shrubs.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its environment.</p>
