<p>Cladium tetragonum, commonly known as the four-sided sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sword-shaped, four-sided leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Cladium tetragonum plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
