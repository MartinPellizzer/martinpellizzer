                    <h1>Crinum viviparum</h1>
<p>Crinum viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous crinum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces bulb-like structures called corms, which store nutrients and enable it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often forming a dense rosette at the base.</p>
<p>Crinum viviparum is also notable for its ability to produce offspring through vivipary, where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
