                    <h1>Colythrum latifolium</h1>
<p>Colythrum latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. It has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the pods, contributing to its spread in natural habitats.</p>
