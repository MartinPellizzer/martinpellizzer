                    <h1>Cuscuta corniculata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta corniculata, commonly known as the horned dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it can be found growing on a variety of herbaceous and woody plants. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for many years, allowing it to persist in infested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural and ornamental crops.</p>
