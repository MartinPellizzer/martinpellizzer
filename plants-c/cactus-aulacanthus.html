<p>Cactus aulacanthus, commonly known as the desert rose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of bright pink or red flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a succulent structure, allowing it to store water and survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>The flowers are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance.</p>
