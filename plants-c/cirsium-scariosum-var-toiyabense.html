                    <h1>Cirsium scariosum var. toiyabense</h1>
<p>Cirsium scariosum var. toiyabense, commonly known as the Toiyabene thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its spiny leaves and purple flower heads.</p>
<p>It is native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Oregon, where it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has a robust root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in late summer, are typically surrounded by bracts that are often mistaken for petals.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to other Cirsium species.</p>
