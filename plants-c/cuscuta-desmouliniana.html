                    <h1>Cuscuta desmouliniana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta desmouliniana, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that twine around its host. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Cuscuta desmouliniana plays a role in ecological interactions and can be a nuisance in agricultural settings.</p>
