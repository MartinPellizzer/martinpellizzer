                    <h1>Cuviera latior var. evorombila</h1>
<p>Cuviera latior var. evorombila, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that feature a distinctive star-shaped pattern on the lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain water in its humid, tropical environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
