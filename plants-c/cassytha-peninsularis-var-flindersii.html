                    <h1>Cassytha peninsularis var. flindersii</h1>
<p>Cassytha peninsularis var. flindersii, commonly known as Flinders' swamp knotweed, is a herbaceous climbing plant native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or seasonally flooded areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
