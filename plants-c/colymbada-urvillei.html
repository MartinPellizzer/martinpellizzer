<p>Colymbada urvillei, commonly known as the Urville's water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its leaves are typically covered in a waxy cuticle that helps repel water, while its roots anchor it in the substrate.</p>
<p>Colymbada urvillei plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
