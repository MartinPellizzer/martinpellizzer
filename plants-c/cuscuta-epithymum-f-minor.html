                    <h1>Cuscuta epithymum f. minor</h1>
<p>Cuscuta epithymum f. minor, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are small and can remain dormant in the soil for extended periods.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host plants.</p>
