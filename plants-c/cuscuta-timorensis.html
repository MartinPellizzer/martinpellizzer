<p>Cuscuta timorensis, commonly known as the Timor dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, attaching itself with specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. It is often found on species of the genus Vitex and other shrubs.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable host plants in its native habitat.</p>
