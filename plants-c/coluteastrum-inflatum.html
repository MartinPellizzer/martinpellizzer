<p>Coluteastrum inflatum, commonly known as the inflated bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are small and usually pink or white, arranged in clusters at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Coluteastrum inflatum is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the digestion of trapped prey for sustenance.</p>
