<p>Ctenopteris isidrensis, commonly known as the Isidrense cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dense forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to vertical surfaces, allowing it to climb and spread across rocky substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately compound, with numerous small, serrated leaflets that contribute to its distinctive appearance.</p>
