                    <h1>Cenchrus palmeri</h1>
<p>Cenchrus palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with bristly hairs, which are adapted for wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common component of desert grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is often used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
