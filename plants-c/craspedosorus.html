                    <h1>Craspedosorus</h1>
<p>Craspedosorus, commonly known as the club moss, is a genus of small, evergreen, fern-like plants that belong to the family Lycopodiales.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their distinct, scale-like leaves and are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Craspedosorus species are often found growing in dense mats or clusters, forming part of the understory in forests. They have a unique reproductive system involving spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are arranged in cones.</p>
<p>Despite their ancient lineage, some species of Craspedosorus are still used in traditional medicine and horticulture.</p>
