<p>Crepidium andersonii subsp.</p>
<p>sarawakense, commonly known as the Sarawak orchid, is a rare terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
