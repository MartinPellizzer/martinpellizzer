                    <h1>Cyclosorus warburgii</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus warburgii, commonly known as the Warburg's water fern, is a small, aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating, four-leaf clover-like structure, which allows it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has no true roots, instead relying on rhizomes to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the water. Its leaves are usually bright green and can vary in shape depending on environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus warburgii is often found in ponds, ditches, and other freshwater habitats across temperate regions.</p>
