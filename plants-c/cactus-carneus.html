                    <h1>Cactus carneus</h1>
<p>Cactus carneus, commonly known as the naked cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are often covered in sparse, short spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warm season, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in both botanical studies and horticultural cultivation.</p>
