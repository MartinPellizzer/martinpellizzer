                    <h1>Callionia pumila</h1>
<p>Callionia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf sandverbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, Callionia pumila is a popular choice for sustainable landscaping in dry climates.</p>
