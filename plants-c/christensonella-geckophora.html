<p>Christensonella geckophora, commonly known as the gecko orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique and striking floral structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pink, and it produces a distinctive, sweet fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
