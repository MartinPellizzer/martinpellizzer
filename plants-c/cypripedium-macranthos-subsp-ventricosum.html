<p>Cypripedium macranthos subsp.</p>
<p>ventricosum, commonly known as the large-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy, pinkish-white flowers with a prominent lip, and its leaves are broad and strap-like.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows on the trunks of trees in moist, shaded forest habitats. It has a complex symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
