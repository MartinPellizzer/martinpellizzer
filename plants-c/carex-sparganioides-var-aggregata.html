                    <h1>Carex sparganioides var. aggregata</h1>
<p>Carex sparganioides var. aggregata, commonly known as the clustered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>The small, inconspicuous flowers are often wind-pollinated, contributing to its reproductive strategy in aquatic environments.</p>
