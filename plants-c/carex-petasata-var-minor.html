                    <h1>Carex petasata var. minor</h1>
<p>Carex petasata var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf marsh sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and bog environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color, with a dense rosette growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in hue, emerging from the base of the foliage. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in areas with poor drainage.</p>
<p>This variety is smaller than the typical Carex petasata, with shorter stems and a more compact appearance.</p>
