                    <h1>Cryptophragmium thwaitesii</h1>
<p>Cryptophragmium thwaitesii, commonly known as the ghost lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent thallus that appears ghostly in appearance, hence its common name. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a cyanobacterium and a fungus, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. It typically grows on rocks, tree bark, and soil in temperate and tropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is often found in shaded, moist habitats where it can absorb moisture and nutrients efficiently.</p>
