                    <h1>Colobanthus polycnemoides</h1>
<p>Colobanthus polycnemoides, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a flowering plant native to the cold climates of Antarctica and sub-Antarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming species with small, narrow leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme environmental conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found on rocky or gravelly substrates.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in such harsh environments makes it an important indicator species for studying plant adaptation to extreme climates.</p>
