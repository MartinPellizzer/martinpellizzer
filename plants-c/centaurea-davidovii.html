                    <h1>Centaurea davidovii</h1>
<p>Centaurea davidovii, commonly known as David's bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it reflect sunlight in its high-altitude habitat. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, dry climates. It has small, spiny leaves and produces seed heads that are often mistaken for the more familiar Centaurea cyanus.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
