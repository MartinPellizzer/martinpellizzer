                    <h1>Caralluma chlorantha</h1>
<p>Caralluma chlorantha, commonly known as the Devil's tongue or desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features erect, branching stems covered in small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>Caralluma chlorantha is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
