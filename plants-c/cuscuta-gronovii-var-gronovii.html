                    <h1>Cuscuta gronovii var. gronovii</h1>
<p>Cuscuta gronovii var. gronovii, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, where it commonly infests crops and ornamental plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to spread widely.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural and horticultural systems.</p>
