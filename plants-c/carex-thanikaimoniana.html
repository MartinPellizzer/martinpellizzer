                    <h1>Carex thanikaimoniana</h1>
<p>Carex thanikaimoniana, commonly known as the Thanikai Mountain sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshy areas of southern India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, a common reproductive strategy among sedges. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy or seasonally flooded habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
