<p>Calyptrogyne trichostachys, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in saline or brackish environments, making it well-adapted to coastal and estuarine habitats. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sediments, contributing to shoreline erosion control.</p>
<p>Calyptrogyne trichostachys is often found in mangrove swamps and salt marshes, where it plays a role in ecological succession.</p>
