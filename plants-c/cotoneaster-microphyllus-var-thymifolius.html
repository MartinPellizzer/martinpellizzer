                    <h1>Cotoneaster microphyllus var. thymifolius</h1>
<p>Cotoneaster microphyllus var. thymifolius, commonly known as the Thyme-leaved Cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, fuzzy hairs, giving them a distinctive thyme-like texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the autumn. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes.</p>
<p>This variety is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade.</p>
