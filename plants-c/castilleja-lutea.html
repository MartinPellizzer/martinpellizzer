<p>Castilleja lutea, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it often grows in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Castilleja lutea plays a role in supporting pollinators and contributes to the ecological diversity of its native environments.</p>
