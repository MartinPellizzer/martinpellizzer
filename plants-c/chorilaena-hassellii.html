                    <h1>Chorilaena hassellii</h1>
<p>Chorilaena hassellii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and historical use in furniture and carving, it is considered a threatened species in many parts of its native range.</p>
