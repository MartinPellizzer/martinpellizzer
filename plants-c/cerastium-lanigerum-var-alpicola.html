                    <h1>Cerastium lanigerum var. alpicola</h1>
<p>Cerastium lanigerum var. alpicola, commonly known as alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and scree slopes at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth and frost resistance, it is a characteristic species of alpine vegetation.</p>
