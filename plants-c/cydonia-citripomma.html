                    <h1>Cydonia citripomma</h1>
<p>Cydonia citripomma, commonly known as the golden quince, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by large, fleshy fruits that ripen in late summer. The fruit has a thick, aromatic skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp with a texture similar to a pear. It is often used in cooking, particularly in jams and preserves, due to its high pectin content.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
