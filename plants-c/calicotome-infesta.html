                    <h1>Calicotome infesta</h1>
<p>Calicotome infesta, commonly known as the Portuguese thorn or barbed wire bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh, dry climates.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used for erosion control and as a source of timber.</p>
