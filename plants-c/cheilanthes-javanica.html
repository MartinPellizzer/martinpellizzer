                    <h1>Cheilanthes javanica</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes javanica, commonly known as the Java rock fern, is a terrestrial fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of lanceolate, leathery leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, white to greyish hairs. The plant is typically found growing on rocky outcrops or in crevices, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor firmly in its habitat.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually unbranched and produce sporangia on the underside, contributing to its reproductive strategy in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
