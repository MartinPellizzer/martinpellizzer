<p>Chamaecrista cotinifolia var. glaberrima, commonly known as the silky senna, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces pods that contain seeds covered in a fine, silky hair, which gives it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
