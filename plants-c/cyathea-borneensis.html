<p>Cyathea borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a significant role in the ecological structure of its habitat.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bioluminescent, which aids in attracting pollinators in the dense forest environment.</p>
