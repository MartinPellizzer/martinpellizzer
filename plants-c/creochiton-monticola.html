This species is typically found in humid, forested environments where it feeds on decaying plant matter and algae. Its reproductive system involves laying eggs in soil or under leaf litter, and it plays a role in nutrient cycling within its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
