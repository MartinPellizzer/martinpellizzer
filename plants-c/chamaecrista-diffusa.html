                    <h1>Chamaecrista diffusa</h1>
<p>Chamaecrista diffusa, commonly known as the coastal goldenball, is a perennial shrub native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy coastal plant. Its small, pod-like fruits contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Chamaecrista diffusa is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its erosion control capabilities and ability to stabilize dunes.</p>
