                    <h1>Cuscuta glomerata var. adpressa</h1>
<p>Cuscuta glomerata var. adpressa, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that缠绕 around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on various plants such as grasses, shrubs, and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through attachment to clothing or vehicles.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
