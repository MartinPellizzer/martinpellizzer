                    <h1>Curcas purgans</h1>
<p>Curcas purgans, commonly known as the physic nut or Barbados nut, is a shrub native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces orange, fleshy fruits that contain toxic seeds. The seeds contain a high concentration of ricin, making them highly poisonous.</p>
<p>Despite its dangers, it has been historically used for its laxative properties, though its use is now largely restricted due to its toxicity.</p>
