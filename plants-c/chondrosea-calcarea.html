                    <h1>Chondrosea calcarea</h1>
<p>Chondrosea calcarea, commonly known as the calcified sea lettuce, is a unique marine green alga found in coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in intertidal zones where it attaches to rocky substrates using a fibrous holdfast. The plant's structure consists of a thin, ribbon-like thallus that is often calcified, providing structural support in its harsh environment. It plays a role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and serving as a food source for various marine organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its calcified composition, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of calcium compounds.</p>
