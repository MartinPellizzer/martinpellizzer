                    <h1>Corchorus prostratus</h1>
<p>Corchorus prostratus, commonly known as bladderleaf or prostrate dock, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes, and lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods that burst to disperse seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in wet meadows.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its unique seed dispersal mechanism and its use in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
