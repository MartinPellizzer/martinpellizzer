                    <h1>Citrus celebica var. southwickii</h1>
<p>Citrus celebica var. southwickii, commonly known as the Southwick's kaffir lime, is a less commonly cultivated citrus variety native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elongated, and highly aromatic leaves, which are often used in traditional cooking. The plant produces small, green, and slightly bitter fruits that are typically not consumed as table fruit but are valued for their essential oils. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific cultivation needs, it is more often found in botanical gardens than in commercial agriculture.</p>
