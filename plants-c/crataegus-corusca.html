                    <h1>Crataegus corusca</h1>
<p>Crataegus corusca, commonly known as the white thornapple, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its thorny stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible but contain seeds surrounded by a tough, inedible pulp. Crataegus corusca typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and other disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation.</p>
