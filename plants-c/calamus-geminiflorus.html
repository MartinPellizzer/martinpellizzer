                    <h1>Calamus geminiflorus</h1>
<p>Calamus geminiflorus, commonly known as the twin-flower screw-palm, is a rare and unique species of cycad native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped leaves that are often divided into two parts, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, which are essential for its reproduction. Calamus geminiflorus thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
