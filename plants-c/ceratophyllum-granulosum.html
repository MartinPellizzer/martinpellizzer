<p>Ceratophyllum granulosum, commonly known as the spiked watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that give it a unique, feathery appearance. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are clustered in spike-like formations, which are often submerged or just at the water's surface. Ceratophyllum granulosum is a fast-growing plant that can form dense mats, influencing water clarity and aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is often used in pond management for its ability to control algae and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
