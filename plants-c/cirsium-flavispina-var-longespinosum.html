<p>Cirsium flavispina var. longespinosum, commonly known as the long-spined yellow thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, leafy stems and large, yellow to orange flower heads that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically covered in fine hairs and have a serrated edge, contributing to its prickly appearance. This variety is distinguished by its longer spines compared to the typical form of Cirsium flavispina.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils.</p>
