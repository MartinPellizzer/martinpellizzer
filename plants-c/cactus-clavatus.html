                    <h1>Cactus clavatus</h1>
<p>Cactus clavatus, commonly known as the club cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in spines and are adapted to store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its root system is shallow and widespread, allowing it to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil.</p>
<p>Despite its hardy nature, it requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive.</p>
