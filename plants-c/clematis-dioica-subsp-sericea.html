<p>Clematis dioica subsp.</p>
<p>sericea, commonly known as the silky clematis, is a climbing vine native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often covered in fine, silky hairs that give it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in spring. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb and twine around supports.</p>
<p>The subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and hardiness.</p>
