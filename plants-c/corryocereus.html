<p>Corryocereus, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a genus of cacti native to South America.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and showy, fragrant flowers that open at night. The flowers are typically white or pale pink and have a strong, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. Corryocereus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>They require minimal water and well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
