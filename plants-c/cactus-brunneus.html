                    <h1>Cactus brunneus</h1>
<p>Cactus brunneus, commonly known as the brown cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Cactus brunneus is well adapted to desert conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in its natural habitat.</p>
