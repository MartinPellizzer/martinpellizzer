                    <h1>Carex distachya f. gynobasica</h1>
<p>Carex distachya f. gynobasica, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a variant of the common sedges, characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in moist environments and support local biodiversity.</p>
