<p>Conosilene conica subsp.</p>
<p>ammophila, commonly known as the sand dune lichen, is a specialized plant that thrives in coastal environments. It is a lichen, a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to withstand harsh conditions such as high salinity, strong winds, and limited moisture. Its structure is usually crust-like, forming a thin, adherent layer on rocky or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>The plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion in coastal regions.</p>
