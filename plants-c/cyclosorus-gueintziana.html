<p>Cyclosorus gueintziana, commonly known as the Gueintziana water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Water ferns.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, rounded lobes. This plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus gueintziana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
