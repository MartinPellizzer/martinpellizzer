<p>Cryptogramma crispa subsp.</p>
<p>raddeana, commonly known as the raddean's cryptogramma, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizomes and its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
