                    <h1>Convolvulus prostratus var. deserti</h1>
<p>Convolvulus prostratus var. deserti, commonly known as desert morning glory, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pale purple to white, blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited to harsh environments and is often found in disturbed soils and sandy areas.</p>
