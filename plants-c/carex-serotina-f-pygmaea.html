                    <h1>Carex serotina f. pygmaea</h1>
<p>Carex serotina f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf late serotina sedge, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces small, inconspicuous brownish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spikelets along the upper stems. It thrives in moist to wet soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for water gardens or bog gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ability to tolerate wet conditions, it is often used in ecological restoration projects and naturalized landscapes.</p>
