                    <h1>Centaurea saussurea</h1>
<p>Centaurea saussurea, commonly known as the Saharan glume, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, bract-like structures that enclose the small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Centaurea saussurea plays a role in stabilizing soil in desert environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
