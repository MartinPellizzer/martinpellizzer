<p>Cathartolinum bracei, commonly known as the rare desert orchid, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, allowing it to store water efficiently.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Cathartolinum bracei is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
