                    <h1>Caralluma burchardii f. sordida</h1>
<p>Caralluma burchardii f. sordida, commonly known as the dark caralluma, is a rare and striking variant of the caralluma genus native to arid regions of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deep green to almost black foliage, which is a result of its unique pigmentation and genetic traits. The plant is a succulent shrub with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically small, spiny, and arranged in a rosette pattern, providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapes due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
