                <h1>Colymbada scopulorum</h1>
<p>Colymbada scopulorum, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in rocky and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. This plant is typically found on bare rock surfaces, where it forms a crust-like growth. Its slow-growing nature makes it an indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and climate change impacts.</p>
