                    <h1>Chromatotriccum maritimum</h1>
<p>Chromatotriccum maritimum, commonly known as the sea lettuce, is a type of green algae that thrives in marine environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, ribbon-like leaves that are typically green in color. This plant is often found in intertidal zones, where it can be exposed to air during low tide. Chromatotriccum maritimum plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and ability to photosynthesize efficiently in saltwater make it a key component of marine biodiversity.</p>
