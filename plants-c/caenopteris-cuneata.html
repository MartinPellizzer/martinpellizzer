<p>Caenopteris cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Caenopteris cuneata plays a role in water filtration and is an indicator of clean, well-oxygenated water.</p>
