                    <h1>Ceratozamia muricata</h1>
<p>Ceratozamia muricata, commonly known as the spiny cycad, is a primitive gymnosperm native to the tropical rainforests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in spines. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine by local communities.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
