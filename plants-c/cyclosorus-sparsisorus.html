                    <h1>Cyclosorus sparsisorus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus sparsisorus, commonly known as the sparse-stemmed cyclosorus, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae, which includes many epiphytic and lithophytic species. The plant is characterized by its small, finely divided fronds that form a dense, carpet-like growth on rocks or tree trunks. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
