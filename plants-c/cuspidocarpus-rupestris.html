<p>Cuspidocarpus rupestris, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a vibrant touch to its rocky habitat. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Cuspidocarpus rupestris is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal in drought-tolerant landscapes.</p>
