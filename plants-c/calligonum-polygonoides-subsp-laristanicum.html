<p>Calligonum polygonoides subsp.</p>
<p>laristanicum, commonly known as the Laristan dwarf tamarisk, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the summer months, which are adapted for pollination by wind or insects. It is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry riverbeds and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
