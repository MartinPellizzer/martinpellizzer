                    <h1>Chloraea ulanthoides var. affinis</h1>
<p>Chloraea ulanthoides var. affinis, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Native to the rainforests of eastern Australia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its unique floral structure includes a single, spurred lip that is both ornamental and functional for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
