<p>Calliscirpus, commonly known as the grass of the genus Calliscirpus, is a group of flowering plants belonging to the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in temperate and subtropical regions, often growing in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. They are characterized by their slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
