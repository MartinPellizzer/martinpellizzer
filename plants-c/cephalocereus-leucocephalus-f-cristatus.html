                    <h1>Cephalocereus leucocephalus f. cristatus</h1>
<p>Cephalocereus leucocephalus f. cristatus, commonly known as the cristate white-armed cactus, is a unique variant of the white-armed cactus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, crown-like growth pattern, which results from a genetic mutation called "cristata.". The plant features a tall, branching structure with white, woolly spines and a dense covering of white, fuzzy hairs. It is native to the arid regions of Mexico and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>This rare and ornamental cactus is popular among collectors for its distinctive appearance and slow growth rate.</p>
