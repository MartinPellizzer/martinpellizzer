<p>Cynanchum grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaf milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinct venation pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by follicles containing seeds with silky pappi for wind dispersal. It thrives in moist to wet soils in woodland or swampy areas, and it is often found in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>Cynanchum grandifolium is part of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its latex-like sap, which can be toxic to some animals.</p>
