                    <h1>Coryphantha radians var. echinus</h1>
<p>Coryphantha radians var. echinus, commonly known as the spiked coryphantha, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often covered in white or grayish spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiky structure. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert regions.</p>
