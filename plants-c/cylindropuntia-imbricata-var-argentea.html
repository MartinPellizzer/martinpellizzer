                    <h1>Cylindropuntia imbricata var. argentea</h1>
<p>Cylindropuntia imbricata var. argentea, commonly known as silver cholla, is a spiny cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features cylindrical stems that are segmented and covered in dense, white woolly hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Its spines are modified leaves that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Silver cholla is adapted to arid environments and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
