                    <h1>Cylindropuntia hystrix</h1>
<p>Cylindropuntia hystrix, commonly known as the fishhook cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, spiny bristles, which provide protection against herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by fruit that contains edible, fleshy seeds. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The fishhook cactus is well adapted to desert conditions, making it a resilient and visually striking plant in its native habitat.</p>
