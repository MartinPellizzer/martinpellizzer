                    <h1>Crocus aerius</h1>
<p>Crocus aerius, commonly known as the alpine crocus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its early blooming habit, often appearing in late winter or early spring before many other plants. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
<p>Crocus aerius is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible bulbs, though they are less commonly consumed than those of the saffron crocus.</p>
