<p>Ctenitis fraterna subsp.</p>
<p>biokoensis, commonly known as the Bioko Ctenitis, is a rare fern species native to the island of Bioko in Equatorial Guinea. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
