<p>Crepidium trinervium, commonly known as the three-veined orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
