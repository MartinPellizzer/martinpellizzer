                    <h1>Chamaebetula acutifolia</h1>
<p>Chamaebetula acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved dwarf birch, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It grows in low, compact forms, often forming dense mats on the ground.</p>
<p>Chamaebetula acutifolia is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can survive in temperatures as low as -50Â°C.</p>
