<p>Cenchrus michoacanus, commonly known as the Mexican sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, while its seeds are small and wind-dispersed.</p>
<p>This species is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in degraded landscapes.</p>
