                    <h1>Cuscuta salina var. papillata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta salina var. papillata, commonly known as salt dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to coastal areas and thrives in saline environments, often found growing on plants such as saltgrass and other halophytes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a weak, thread-like stem covered in tiny, papillate structures. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain viable in the soil for extended periods.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to the ecological balance of salt-affected habitats.</p>
