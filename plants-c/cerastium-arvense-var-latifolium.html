                    <h1>Cerastium arvense var. latifolium</h1>
<p>Cerastium arvense var. latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The leaves are heart-shaped, broad, and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its larger, more robust leaves compared to the typical form of Cerastium arvense.</p>
