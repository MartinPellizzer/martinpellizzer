                    <h1>Colpodium tibeticum</h1>
<p>Colpodium tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are slender and often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface.</p>
<p>Colpodium tibeticum plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its native habitat by contributing to the aquatic food web.</p>
