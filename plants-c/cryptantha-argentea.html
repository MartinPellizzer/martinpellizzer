                    <h1>Cryptantha argentea</h1>
<p>Cryptantha argentea, commonly known as silver cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its silver-gray foliage is a result of dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Cryptantha argentea is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a short-lived perennial.</p>
