<p>Smooth groundsel, scientifically known as Chamaesyce humifusa var. glabra, is a low-growing plant commonly found in disturbed soils across the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragweeds, and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellow flowers. Despite its modest appearance, this plant plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators. Its smooth, hairless leaves distinguish it from other groundsel species, making it easily identifiable in the wild. While not widely cultivated, Smooth groundsel is a valuable addition to native plant gardens and restoration projects.</p>
