                    <h1>Capnorchis</h1>
<p>Capnorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a unique appearance, with long, slender leaves and a single, delicate flower that resembles a ghostly figure. Capnorchis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
