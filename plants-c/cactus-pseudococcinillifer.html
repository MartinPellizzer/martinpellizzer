                    <h1>Cactus pseudococcinillifer</h1>
<p>Cactus pseudococcinillifer, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering that helps reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling shrub with thick, fleshy stems that store water. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in clusters during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Despite its appearance, it is not a true cactus but belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds.</p>
