<p>Cuscuta lacerata, commonly known as the fragrant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish-white flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means.</p>
<p>Cuscuta lacerata is native to North America and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
