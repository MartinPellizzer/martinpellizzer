<p>Cyrtochiloides ochmatochila, commonly known as the Orchid of the Andes, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a sympodial growth habit, characterized by its short, creeping rhizomes. The plant produces small, compact pseudobulbs that bear a single leaf each, and its flowers are typically greenish-white with a distinct, fragrant scent. Cyrtochiloides ochmatochila thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
