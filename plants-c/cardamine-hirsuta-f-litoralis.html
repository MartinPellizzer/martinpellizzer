                    <h1>Cardamine hirsuta f. litoralis</h1>
<p>Cardamine hirsuta f. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal watercress, is a variant of the hairy watercress that thrives in moist, often saline environments.</p>
<p>This fern-like plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, adapted to withstand coastal conditions. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils near the shore, where it can tolerate frequent exposure to sea spray. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for coastal ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
