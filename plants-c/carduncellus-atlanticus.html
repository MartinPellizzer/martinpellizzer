                    <h1>Carduncellus atlanticus</h1>
<p>Carduncellus atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic carduncellus, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stalks and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
