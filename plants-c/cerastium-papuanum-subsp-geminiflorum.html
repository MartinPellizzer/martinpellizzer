<p>Cerastium papuanum subsp.</p>
<p>geminiflorum, commonly known as the Papuan mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Papua, Indonesia. It features small, basal rosettes of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers during the cooler months, typically from spring to early summer. Its flowers are arranged in dense, glandular inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to rocky and alpine soils, showcasing its resilience in harsh, high-altitude conditions.</p>
