<p>Campylotropis gracilis, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Campylotropis gracilis plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria.</p>
