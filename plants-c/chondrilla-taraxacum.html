<p>Chondrilla taraxacum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head, known as a pappus, which consists of fine, hair-like structures that aid in wind dispersal.
