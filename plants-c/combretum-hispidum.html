                    <h1>Combretum hispidum</h1>
<p>Combretum hispidum, commonly known as the rough combretum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is a common component of dryland vegetation in its native range.</p>
