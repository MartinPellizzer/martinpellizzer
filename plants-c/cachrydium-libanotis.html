<p>Cachrydium libanotis, commonly known as the Lebanon cedar, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the mountainous regions of Lebanon.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and conical crown, with needle-like leaves that are dark green and dense. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited natural habitat and historical significance, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies.</p>
<p>Its resilience and unique morphology make it an important subject in the study of Mediterranean flora.</p>
