<p>Calonemorchis caesarea subsp.</p>
<p>transiens, commonly known as the Transient Skyflower, is a rare and delicate member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a bluish tinge. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a rosette that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
