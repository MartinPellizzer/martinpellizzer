                    <h1>Cycniopsis humifusa var. parviflora</h1>
<p>Cycniopsis humifusa var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in shallow water.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing soil.</p>
