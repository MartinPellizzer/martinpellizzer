                    <h1>Citrus × vulgaris var. glaberrima</h1>
<p>Citrus × vulgaris var. glaberrima, commonly known as the rough lemon, is a citrus plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, rough, and often fissured rind, which is distinct from the smoother peel of other citrus varieties. The plant typically produces small, sour fruits that are not commonly consumed by humans but are valued in horticulture for their hardiness and use in grafting. It thrives in warm climates and is often used as a rootstock for other citrus trees due to its disease resistance.</p>
<p>The leaves are broad, ovate, and have a slightly waxy texture, contributing to its overall distinctive appearance.</p>
