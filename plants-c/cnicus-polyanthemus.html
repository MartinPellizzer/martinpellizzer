                    <h1>Cnicus polyanthemus</h1>
<p>Cnicus polyanthemus, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves and its clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across various habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural landscapes.</p>
