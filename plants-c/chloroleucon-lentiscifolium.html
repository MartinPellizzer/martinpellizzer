<p>Chloroleucon lentiscifolium, commonly known as the Mediterranean buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its root system is deep and resilient, allowing it to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant's aromatic leaves and branches have historically been used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties.</p>
