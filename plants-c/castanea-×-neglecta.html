                    <h1>Castanea × neglecta</h1>
<p>Castanea × neglecta, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut hybrid, is a naturally occurring cross between the Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollis) and the Japanese chestnut (Castanea crenata).</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10–15 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. The plant produces spiny, cupule-like structures that enclose its edible, chestnut-like seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas of East Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and potential for hybrid vigor, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>
