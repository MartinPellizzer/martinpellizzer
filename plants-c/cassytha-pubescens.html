<p>Cassytha pubescens, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color, blooming throughout the warmer months. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive texture.</p>
<p>Cassytha pubescens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands.</p>
