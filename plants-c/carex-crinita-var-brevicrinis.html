<p>Carex crinita var. brevicrinis, commonly known as the short-hair sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like stems that are often reddish at the base and bear dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and typically have a slight sheen, contributing to its ornamental appeal.
