                    <h1>Calyptrella littoralis</h1>
<p>Calyptrella littoralis, commonly known as the coastal lichen, is a unique lichen species that thrives in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form, which helps it retain moisture in harsh, salty conditions. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, enabling it to survive in nutrient-poor substrates. It is often found on rocks, soil, or dead wood near the shoreline.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, Calyptrella littoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.</p>
