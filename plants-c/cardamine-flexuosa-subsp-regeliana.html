<p>Cardamine flexuosa subsp.</p>
<p>regeliana, commonly known as the creeping watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia and Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors.</p>
<p>The plant features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its small, trifoliate leaves are alternate and have a slightly succulent texture.</p>
<p>The flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and produce small, round seeds that are dispersed by water or wind.</p>
