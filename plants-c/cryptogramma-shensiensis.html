<p>Cryptogramma shensiensis, commonly known as the Sichuan cryptogramma, is a species of fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Cryptogramma shensiensis make it an interesting subject for studies on fern morphology and adaptation.</p>
