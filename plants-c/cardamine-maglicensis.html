                    <h1>Cardamine maglicensis</h1>
<p>Cardamine maglicensis, commonly known as the MagliÄ‡ watercress, is a rare and delicate perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the Dinaric Alps.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many edible and economically important plants. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain streams and rocky crevices. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
