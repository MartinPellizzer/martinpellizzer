<p>Camaridium arachnites, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, spider-like floral structure, which features long, slender petals and a prominent, hooded lip. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, thriving in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with subtle markings that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Camaridium arachnites is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
