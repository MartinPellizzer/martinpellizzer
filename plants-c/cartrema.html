                    <h1>Cartrema</h1>
<p>Cartrema, commonly known as the "crown of the forest," is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants like buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that resemble a hand, and its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. Cartrema thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research.</p>
