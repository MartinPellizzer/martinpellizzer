<p>Culcasia mannii, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its roots are fibrous and often form dense mats, which can help stabilize sediments.</p>
<p>Culcasia mannii is also known for its ability to absorb heavy metals from the water, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts.</p>
