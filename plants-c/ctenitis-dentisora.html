                    <h1>Ctenitis dentisora</h1>
<p>Ctenitis dentisora, commonly known as the toothed fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with finely serrated margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces multiple fertile and sterile fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
