                    <h1>Calyptrostegia linifolia</h1>
<p>Calyptrostegia linifolia, commonly known as the silky leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. Its root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Calyptrostegia linifolia plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by supporting certain bird species that consume its berries.</p>
