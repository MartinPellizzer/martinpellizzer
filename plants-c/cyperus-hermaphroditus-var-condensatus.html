                    <h1>Cyperus hermaphroditus var. condensatus</h1>
<p>Cyperus hermaphroditus var. condensatus, commonly known as the dense flowering rush, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its dense, compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically greenish or reddish in color. The plant is native to parts of Africa and thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, ditches, and along the edges of water bodies. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an effective colonizer of disturbed wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure supports its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
