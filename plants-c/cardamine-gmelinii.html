<p>Cardamine gmelinii, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a small perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky soils and forest floors. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and colonize rocky habitats effectively.</p>
<p>Cardamine gmelinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local insect populations.</p>
