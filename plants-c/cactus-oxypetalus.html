                    <h1>Cactus oxypetalus</h1>
<p>Cactus oxypetalus, commonly known as the red-tipped cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of vibrant red flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions by accessing water from deeper underground. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal insects such as moths and bats, which are attracted to its strong scent and nectar.</p>
