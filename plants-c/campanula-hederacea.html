                    <h1>Campanula hederacea</h1>
<p>Campanula hederacea, commonly known as the ivy-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, slightly hairy leaves that resemble those of ivy. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Campanula hederacea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion.</p>
