<p>Cheiridopsis angustifolia subsp.</p>
<p>protoparcoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and low maintenance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in coastal and Mediterranean climates.</p>
