<p>Centaurea repens, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It has small, hairy leaves and produces delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily in new environments.</p>
<p>Centaurea repens is often considered a weed but has some medicinal uses in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
