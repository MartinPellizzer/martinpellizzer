<p>Centaurea variegata var. aligera, commonly known as the variable star thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, spiny stems and bright yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. This variety is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
