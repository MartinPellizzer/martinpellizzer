                    <h1>Cerastium alpinum var. fischerianum</h1>
<p>Cerastium alpinum var. fischerianum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, hairy, kidney-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions. It has a mat-forming growth habit, which helps it anchor in loose soil and withstand strong winds.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in rock gardens and alpine displays due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
