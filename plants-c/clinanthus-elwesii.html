<p>Clinanthus elwesii, commonly known as the Elwes' chionachne, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its delicate, feathery inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are often white or pale pink, and it produces small, bead-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Clinanthus elwesii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
