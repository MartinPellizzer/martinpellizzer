                    <h1>Caulinia oceanica</h1>
<p>Caulinia oceanica, commonly known as the sea bladder, is a unique marine plant found in coastal regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cystophoraceae and is characterized by its bladder-like structures that float on the surface of the water. These structures are filled with air and help the plant remain buoyant in aquatic environments. The plant is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including saltwater and strong waves.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and specialized structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
