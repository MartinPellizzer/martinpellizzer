                    <h1>Cardamomum verum</h1>
<p>Cardamomum verum, commonly known as true cardamom, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, spindle-shaped seed pods. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into the highly fragrant, reddish-brown pods containing the aromatic seeds. These seeds are widely used in both culinary and medicinal applications due to their strong, spicy flavor and essential oil content.</p>
<p>Cardamomum verum thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil and requires a warm climate for optimal growth.</p>
