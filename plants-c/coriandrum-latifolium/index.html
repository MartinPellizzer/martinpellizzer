                            <h1>Coriandrum Latifolium</h1>
<p>Coriandrum latifolium is a lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family known for its broad, aromatic leaves and delicate white flowers. Native to the Mediterranean region, this plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its leaves are commonly used as a herb, adding a fresh, slightly citrusy flavor to culinary dishes. The plant also attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to ecological gardens. Despite its benefits, it remains underappreciated compared to more widely cultivated members of its family.</p>
