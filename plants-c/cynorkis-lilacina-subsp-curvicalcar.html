<p>Cynorkis lilacina subsp.</p>
<p>curvicalcar, commonly known as the curving-spurred orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to specific regions in South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically display a mix of pink and white hues.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, upright stem with few leaves and a cluster of small, spurred flowers. Its unique floral structure, particularly the curved spur, is an adaptation for pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings.</p>
