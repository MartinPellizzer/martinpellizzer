                    <h1>Cystopus tashiroi</h1>
<p>Cystopus tashiroi, commonly known as the Japanese water shield, is a unique aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves, which are deeply lobed and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged or just at the water's surface. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Cystopus tashiroi is valued for its ecological role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in wetland ecosystems.</p>
