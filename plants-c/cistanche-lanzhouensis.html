                    <h1>Cistanche lanzhouensis</h1>
<p>Cistanche lanzhouensis, commonly known as the Chinese parasitic wormwood, is a halophytic plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of China.</p>
<p>It is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of host plants, primarily members of the Chenopodiaceae family. The plant is characterized by its yellowish stems and lack of true leaves, with most of its photosynthetic function carried out by its yellow flowers. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Cistanche lanzhouensis is also valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
