                    <h1>Callogramme caeciliae</h1>
<p>Callogramme caeciliae, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, waxy leaves and its unique ability to grow without soil, relying instead on epiphytic relationships with trees. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green, often resembling the shape of a ghostly figure. Its botanical significance lies in its specialized adaptations to nutrient-poor environments and its role in ecological research.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a threatened species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
