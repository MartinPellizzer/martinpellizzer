<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive yellow pouch-like flower that resembles a slipper, which is used to attract pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single flower per stem, usually between late spring and early summer.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also of interest in botanical research due to its hybrid nature and ecological adaptations.</p>
