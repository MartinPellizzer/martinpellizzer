<p>Crotalaria turgida, commonly known as the inflated bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or pea family, and is characterized by its distinctive seed pods that inflate as they mature. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with compound leaves and produces yellow or orange flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in inflated, membranous pods that burst open when dry, dispersing the seeds forcefully.</p>
<p>Crotalaria turgida is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value but can also be considered a weed in certain agricultural settings.</p>
