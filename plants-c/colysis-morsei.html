                    <h1>Colysis morsei</h1>
<p>Colysis morsei, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking white, ghost-like flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Colysis morsei is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
