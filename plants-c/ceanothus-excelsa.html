<p>Ceanothus excelsa, commonly known as the tall ceanothus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, silvery hair, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat.</p>
<p>Ceanothus excelsa is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
