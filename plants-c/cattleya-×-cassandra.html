<p>Cattleya × cassandra, commonly known as the Cassandra orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and orange, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of drought.</p>
<p>Cattleya × cassandra is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
