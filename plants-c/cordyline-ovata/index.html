<p>Cordyline ovata is a striking plant native to the island of New Zealand. It is known for its tall, slender trunk and its vibrant, lance-shaped leaves that often display a deep green color. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is commonly found in rainforests. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Despite its beauty, it is also valued for its cultural significance among the Māori people.</p>
