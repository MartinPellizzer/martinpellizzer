<p>Chitonia fothergilla, commonly known as silverlace vine, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely cut, lace-like foliage that turns a striking coppery red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for woodland gardens and as a groundcover.</p>
