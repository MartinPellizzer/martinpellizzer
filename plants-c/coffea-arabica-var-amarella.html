                    <h1>Coffea arabica var. amarella</h1>
<p>Coffea arabica var. amarella, commonly known as the yellow bean coffee, is a lesser-known variant of the Arabica coffee species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique yellowish fruit color, which distinguishes it from the more common red-fruited Arabica varieties. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with a tropical climate, requiring specific conditions to thrive. Its leaves are medium-sized, elliptical in shape, and have a glossy surface.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated commercially, it is valued for its distinct flavor profile and potential for specialty coffee production.</p>
