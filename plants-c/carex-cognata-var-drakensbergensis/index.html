                            <h1>Carex Cognata Var. Drakensbergensis</h1>
<p>Drakensberg sedge, scientifically known as Carex cognata var. drakensbergensis, is a striking member of the sedge family found primarily in the mountainous regions of South Africa. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often seen growing in open grasslands and along stream banks. With its unique foliage and adaptability to harsh environments, it plays an important role in local ecosystems. Its presence is a sign of healthy, undisturbed habitats. Despite its resilience, the species faces threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
