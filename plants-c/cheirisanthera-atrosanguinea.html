                    <h1>Cheirisanthera atrosanguinea</h1>
<p>Cheirisanthera atrosanguinea, commonly known as the black blood orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark red to black-colored flowers, which are highly unusual in the orchid family. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, while its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the mineral-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
