                    <h1>Corybas ekuamensis</h1>
<p>Corybas ekuamensis, commonly known as the Ekuamensis hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of western Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, hood-like floral structure that encloses the reproductive organs, a feature typical of the Corybas genus. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a dark purple or reddish hue, often with intricate patterns on its petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and has adapted to nutrient-poor soils through mycorrhizal associations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
