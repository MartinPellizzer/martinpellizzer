                    <h1>Cohnia flabelliformis</h1>
<p>Cohnia flabelliformis, commonly known as the fan-shaped liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive leaf structure with a fan-shaped appearance, which gives it its common name. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf-like structures called thallus.</p>
<p>Cohnia flabelliformis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
