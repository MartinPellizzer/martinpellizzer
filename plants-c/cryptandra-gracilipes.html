                    <h1>Cryptandra gracilipes</h1>
<p>Cryptandra gracilipes, commonly known as the slender cryptandra, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting nectar-feeding insects. It is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Cryptandra gracilipes is often found in coastal dunes and is a characteristic component of the region's unique flora.</p>
