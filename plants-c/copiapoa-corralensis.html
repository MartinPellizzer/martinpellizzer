<p>It is a columnar cactus with a short, thick stem that often develops a bulbous base over time. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring. Its spines are short and white, providing some camouflage in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Copiapoa corralensis is adapted to extreme drought conditions, storing water in its stem for survival.</p>
