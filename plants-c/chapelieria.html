                    <h1>Chapelieria</h1>
<p>Chapelieria, commonly known as the "dancing plant," is a unique species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that move in response to changes in light and temperature, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are fibrous and help it thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Botanically, Chapelieria belongs to the family Araliaceae and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
