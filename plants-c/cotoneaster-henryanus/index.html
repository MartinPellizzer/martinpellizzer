<p>Chinese cotoneaster, scientifically known as Cotoneaster henryanus, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is valued for its ornamental qualities, featuring clusters of bright red berries and delicate, lace-like foliage. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking hardy, low-maintenance plants. Its adaptability and resilience have led to its cultivation in various climates around the world. Despite its beauty, it is important to note that the plant can be invasive in certain regions if not properly managed.</p>
