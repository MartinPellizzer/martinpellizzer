                    <h1>Conostegia dentata</h1>
<p>Conostegia dentata, commonly known as the toothed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically white or pink, clustered in small inflorescences. The plant produces small, spherical berries that are a source of food for birds and other animals.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent.</p>
