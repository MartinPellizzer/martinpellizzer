                    <h1>Castilleja fasciculata var. inverta</h1>
<p>Castilleja fasciculata var. inverta, commonly known as the inverted false nettle, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on the roots of other plants for some of its nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to the western United States and typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has bright yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are usually erect and branching.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its inverted inflorescence, which sets it apart from other members of the Castilleja genus.</p>
