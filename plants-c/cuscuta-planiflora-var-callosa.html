                    <h1>Cuscuta planiflora var. callosa</h1>
<p>Cuscuta planiflora var. callosa, commonly known as the flatleaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and often infests agricultural crops and wild plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means, allowing it to spread easily.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to its host plants, reducing their growth and yield.</p>
