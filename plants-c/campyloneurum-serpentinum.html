                    <h1>Campyloneurum serpentinum</h1>
<p>Campyloneurum serpentinum, commonly known as the serpent fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the ultramafic soils of Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, serpentine-shaped fronds that give it its common name. This plant thrives in nutrient-poor, magnesium-rich environments, often found in rocky, volcanic soils. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ultramafic ecosystems.</p>
