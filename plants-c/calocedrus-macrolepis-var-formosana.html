                    <h1>Calocedrus macrolepis var. formosana</h1>
<p>Calocedrus macrolepis var. formosana, commonly known as the Formosan incense cedar, is a rare and endemic conifer native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the cypress family (Cupressaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, scale-like leaves and small, cone-like structures. The tree typically grows in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates, often in well-drained soils. Its bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, while its wood is highly valued for its fragrance and durability.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
