<p>Coryanthes speciosa var. vitellina, commonly known as the golden coryanthe, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, intricate flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, featuring a distinctive yellow corona. The plant thrives in high humidity and warm temperatures, requiring bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it grows on trees rather than in soil, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>The unique morphology of its flowers makes it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and among orchid enthusiasts.</p>
