                    <h1>Carduus × halanensis</h1>
<p>Carduus × halanensis, commonly known as the Russian thistle or goatweed, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prickly, spiny leaves and a distinctive, spiky flower head that resembles a small crown. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in agricultural fields. It produces a large number of seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in new regions.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Carduus × halanensis make it well adapted to survive in harsh environments and compete with native plant species.</p>
