                            <h1>Cleome Brachypoda</h1>
<p>Cleome shrub, scientifically known as Cleome brachypoda, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. This hardy plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for gardeners and landscapers. Cleome brachypoda not only adds visual interest to gardens but also supports local pollinator populations.</p>
