<p>Cereus iquiquensis, commonly known as the Iquique candle, is a cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Cereus iquiquensis is well adapted to extreme desert environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
