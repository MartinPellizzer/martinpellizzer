The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
