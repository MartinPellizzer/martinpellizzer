<p>Chamaedrys quadratula, commonly known as the square-leaved mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its foliage composed of small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly leathery. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the spring and early summer. These flowers are followed by small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful.</p>
<p>Chamaedrys quadratula is often found in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments.</p>
