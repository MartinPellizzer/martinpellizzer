<p>Crataegus segnis, commonly known as the slender hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to elliptic leaves, and white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often tart, containing several seeds. Crataegus segnis is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a notable species in both horticultural and ecological contexts.</p>
