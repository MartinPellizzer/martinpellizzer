                    <h1>Calamagrostis chordorrhiza</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis chordorrhiza, commonly known as the river reed, is a tall grass species native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshes, along riverbanks, and in other moist environments, forming dense stands that help stabilize soil. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an effective colonizer of disturbed wetland areas.</p>
<p>Calamagrostis chordorrhiza plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for wildlife and improving water quality.</p>
