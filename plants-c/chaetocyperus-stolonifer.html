<p>Chaetocyperus stolonifer, commonly known as the creeping flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, three-angled spikelets that are often clustered at the base. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps and along waterways.</p>
<p>Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that can dominate wetland ecosystems.</p>
