                    <h1>Cryophytum gibbosum</h1>
<p>Cryophytum gibbosum, commonly known as the snowball cactus, is a unique succulent native to the cold regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a dense, rounded stem that resembles a snowball, covered in small, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers during the warmer months, adding a delicate beauty to its structure. Its thick, water-storing stems allow it to survive in arid or frost-prone environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled conditions to thrive outside its native range.</p>
