                    <h1>Calydermos repens</h1>
<p>Calydermos repens, commonly known as the creeping calydermos, is a low-growing perennial plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features slender,匍匐 (creeping) stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Calydermos repens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
