                    <h1>Cypripedium insigne var. mooreanum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium insigne var. mooreanum, commonly known as the Moorean lady's slipper, is a rare orchid species native to the island of Moorea in French Polynesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive pink to purple flowers with a large, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its native environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its natural range.</p>
