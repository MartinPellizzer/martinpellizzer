                    <h1>Caenopteris</h1>
<p>Caenopteris, commonly known as the rock holly fern, is a genus of ferns native to various regions of the world, including Asia, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often upright fronds that can resemble the shape of holly leaves, hence their common name. Caenopteris species typically thrive in rocky or shaded environments, often growing on cliffs or in forest understories. Their fronds are usually leathery and have a rough texture, which helps them retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The genus is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage.</p>
