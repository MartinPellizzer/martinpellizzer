                    <h1>Cordia microsebestena</h1>
<p>Cordia microsebestena, commonly known as the small-leaved cottonwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 5â€“10 meters and has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, spherical fruits that split open to release seeds. Its bark is often fissured and may exude a milky sap when wounded.</p>
<p>Cordia microsebestena is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
