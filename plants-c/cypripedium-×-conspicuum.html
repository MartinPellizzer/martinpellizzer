<p>Cypripedium × conspicuum, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, showy pouch-shaped lip that resembles a slipper, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments and has a long, fleshy rhizome that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Its flowers are usually pink to red in color, with a white or pale yellow throat, and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Cypripedium × conspicuum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
