<p>Cuspidaria tricuspis, commonly known as the three-pointed sea lettuce, is a marine green alga found in coastal regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ulvaceae and is characterized by its blade-like thallus with a distinctive three-lobed structure. The plant typically grows in shallow, brackish waters and is often found attached to rocks or submerged structures. Its simple morphology includes a single layer of cells, making it easily identifiable under a microscope.</p>
<p>Cuspidaria tricuspis plays a role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
