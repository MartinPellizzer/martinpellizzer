                    <h1>Ceanothus pauciflorus</h1>
<p>Ceanothus pauciflorus, commonly known as the coast ceanothus, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Ceanothus pauciflorus plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is a key component of coastal scrub ecosystems.</p>
