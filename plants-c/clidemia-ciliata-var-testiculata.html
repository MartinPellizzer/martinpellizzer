<p>Clidemia ciliata var. testiculata, commonly known as the hairy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Onagraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as mangroves and other tropical hardwoods. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers followed by berries that are often consumed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health of its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
