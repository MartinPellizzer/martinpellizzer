                    <h1>Chabertia cladophora</h1>
<p>Chabertia cladophora, commonly known as the clustered moss, is a small, acrocarpous moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a wiry stem with closely packed, ovate leaves that are often curved at the tips. Its reproductive structures, including capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks, and the plant produces spores in a dry, operculate capsule.</p>
<p>Chabertia cladophora is often used in ecological studies to assess environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution.</p>
