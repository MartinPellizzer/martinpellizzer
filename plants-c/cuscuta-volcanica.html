                    <h1>Cuscuta volcanica</h1>
<p>Cuscuta volcanica, commonly known as the volcanic dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed dispersal through the feces of animals. The plant is native to volcanic regions in Central and South America, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its roots penetrate the vascular systems of its hosts, extracting water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Cuscuta volcanica plays a role in ecological interactions and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
