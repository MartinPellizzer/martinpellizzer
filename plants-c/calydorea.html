                    <h1>Calydorea</h1>
<p>Calydorea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has slender, leafless stems and produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. Calydorea is known for its unique appearance and is often considered a symbol of rarity in the botanical world.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is listed as endangered in many regions.</p>
