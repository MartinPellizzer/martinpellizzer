<p>Colubrina glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky colubrina, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glandular leaves that exude a sticky substance, which can attract insects and deter herbivores. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Colubrina glandulosa is often found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in coastal areas.</p>
