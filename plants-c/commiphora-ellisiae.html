                    <h1>Commiphora ellisiae</h1>
<p>Commiphora ellisiae, commonly known as the Elysian myrrh, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the rainforests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that belongs to the Burseraceae family, known for its aromatic resinous properties. The plant produces a dark, aromatic gum resin, similar to myrrh, which has been historically used in traditional medicine. Its limited distribution and habitat specificity make it highly vulnerable to environmental changes and deforestation.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique botanical species.</p>
