                    <h1>Colutea arborescens var. longiracemosa</h1>
<p>Colutea arborescens var. longiracemosa, commonly known as the long raceme broomrape, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that appear in long, branching clusters. The plant has slender, hairy stems and pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of true roots and reliance on parasitic relationships, it is considered a hemiparasite, drawing nutrients from host plants.</p>
