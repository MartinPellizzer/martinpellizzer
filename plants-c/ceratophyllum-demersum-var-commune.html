                    <h1>Ceratophyllum demersum var. commune</h1>
<p>Ceratophyllum demersum var. commune, commonly known as water fir, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats across the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features dense, feathery foliage composed of small, opposite leaves that provide habitat for aquatic organisms. The plant lacks true stems and roots, relying on its branching structure for anchorage. It is often found in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it both a valuable aquatic vegetation and a potential invasive species in non-native environments.</p>
