<p>Campyloneurum aphanophlebium, commonly known as the cryptic moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and densely packed, acicular leaves that are often curved or twisted. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Its sporophytes are relatively short, with a single, elongated capsule that is often covered in a thick, persistent peristome.</p>
<p>This moss is notable for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, making it a common component of temperate and boreal ecosystems.</p>
