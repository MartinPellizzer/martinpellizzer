<p>Climacoptera subcrassa, commonly known as the rough-stemmed climacoptera, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and small, clustered leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its succulent nature allows it to store moisture, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Climacoptera subcrassa is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, where it thrives with minimal water input.</p>
