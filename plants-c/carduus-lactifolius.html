                    <h1>Carduus lactifolius</h1>
<p>Carduus lactifolius, commonly known as the milk thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers, which bloom in the summer months. The plant contains a milky sap, which is why it is also called milk thistle. Its most notable feature is the presence of a compound called silymarin, found in its seeds, which has been studied for potential liver-protecting properties.</p>
<p>Carduus lactifolius is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
