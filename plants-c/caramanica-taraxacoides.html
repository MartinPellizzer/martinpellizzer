                    <h1>Caramanica taraxacoides</h1>
<p>Caramanica taraxacoides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems and providing habitat for small insects.</p>
