                    <h1>Coeloglossum satyrioides</h1>
<p>Coeloglossum satyrioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, which are covered in a sponge-like tissue called a velamen. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees in the wetlands of Florida and Georgia.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
