                    <h1>Capsicophysalis</h1>
<p>Capsicophysalis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant species native to the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, translucent pink petals that appear to glow in low light conditions. The plant has a short flowering period, typically during the cooler months, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its rare habitat and limited distribution, Capsicophysalis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
