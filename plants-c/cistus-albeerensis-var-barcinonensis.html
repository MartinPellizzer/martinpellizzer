                    <h1>Cistus albeerensis var. barcinonensis</h1>
<p>Cistus albeerensis var. barcinonensis, commonly known as the Barcino shrub, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with dense, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate with its drought-resistant properties.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
