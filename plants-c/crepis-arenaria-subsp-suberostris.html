<p>Crepis arenaria subsp.</p>
<p>suberostris, commonly known as the sand hill mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to arid and sandy regions of Europe. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a compact rosette of silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a single head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status highlights subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf shape and flower structure.</p>
