                    <h1>Conosilene conica var. sartorii</h1>
<p>Conosilene conica var. sartorii, commonly known as the Sartorii Coneflower, is a rare and unique variant of the Conosilene conica species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive conical flower structure, which is both ornamental and botanically significant. The plant typically grows in specific ecological niches, often in dry, rocky soils with limited nutrients. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations.</p>
<p>This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential genetic uniqueness.</p>
