                    <h1>Connarus nemorosus</h1>
<p>Connarus nemorosus, commonly known as the swamp mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elongated, elliptical leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in swampy or riparian habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
