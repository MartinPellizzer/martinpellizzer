                    <h1>Cactus subquadriflorus</h1>
<p>Cactus subquadriflorus, commonly known as the four-flowered cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in spines and are adapted to store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a feature common in cacti that helps reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The four-flowered cactus is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
