                    <h1>Castilleja pallida var. hyparctica</h1>
<p>Castilleja pallida var. hyparctica, commonly known as the pale castilleja, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reduced leaves and specialized root system that attaches to the roots of other plants. The plant produces showy, often red or orange flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in open, sunny habitats like grasslands and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nutrient cycling through its parasitic relationship with host plants.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in some regions.</p>
