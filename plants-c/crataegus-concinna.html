                    <h1>Crataegus concinna</h1>
<p>Crataegus concinna, commonly known as the smooth thornapple, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white to pink flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally unpalatable to humans. Crataegus concinna typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodland areas and is often found along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal interest, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens.</p>
