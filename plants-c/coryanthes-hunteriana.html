                    <h1>Coryanthes hunteriana</h1>
<p>Coryanthes hunteriana, commonly known as the Hunter's coryanthe, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, intricate flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, with a distinctive hood-shaped labellum. The plant produces a strong, unpleasant odor reminiscent of decaying meat, which attracts carrion flies for pollination. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil through symbiotic relationships with fungi.</p>
<p>This species is highly valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ecological significance.</p>
