                    <h1>Ceramocarpium umbrosum</h1>
<p>Ceramocarpium umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the shaded understories of tropical forests.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, glossy fronds that thrive in low-light conditions. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in compact clusters on the underside of its leaves. It requires high humidity and well-drained, acidic soil to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
