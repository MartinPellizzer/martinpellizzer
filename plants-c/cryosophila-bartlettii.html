                    <h1>Cryosophila bartlettii</h1>
<p>Cryosophila bartlettii, commonly known as the Antarctic buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the cold environments of Antarctica.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom during the short summer season. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to the extreme cold and nutrient-poor conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are typically hairy and compact, which helps reduce water loss in the harsh climate.</p>
<p>Cryosophila bartlettii plays a unique role in the Antarctic ecosystem, contributing to the limited floral diversity in such an extreme environment.</p>
