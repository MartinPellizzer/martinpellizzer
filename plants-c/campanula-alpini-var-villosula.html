                    <h1>Campanula alpini var. villosula</h1>
<p>Campanula alpini var. villosula, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its harsh, high-altitude environment. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
