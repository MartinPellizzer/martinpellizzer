                    <h1>Cycas scratchleyana</h1>
<p>Cycas scratchleyana, commonly known as the Northern Territory cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It is native to northern Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Queensland, and thrives in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
