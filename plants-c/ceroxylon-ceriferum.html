                    <h1>Ceroxylon ceriferum</h1>
<p>Ceroxylon ceriferum, commonly known as the wax palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the Caribbean, particularly Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as a natural insect repellent. The plant can grow up to 20 meters in height and has a long, unbranched trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces large, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>The wax palm is also culturally significant and is considered a symbol of Puerto Rican identity.</p>
