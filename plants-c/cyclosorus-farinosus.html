                    <h1>Cyclosorus farinosus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus farinosus, commonly known as the sticky cyclosorus, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant produces sporangia that are covered in a sticky substance, which aids in spore dispersal. It is a cryptogamic plant, meaning it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus farinosus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates.</p>
