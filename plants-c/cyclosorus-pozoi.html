<p>Cyclosorus pozoi, commonly known as the velvetleaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, floating fronds that form a mat on the water surface, which helps in stabilizing the water body. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with roots that anchor it to submerged substrates. Its leaves are typically dark green and covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus pozoi is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and streams, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystem dynamics.</p>
