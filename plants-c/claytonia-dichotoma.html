<p>Claytonia dichotoma, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its growth habit is creeping, with stems branching at the base and forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Claytonia dichotoma is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun to partial shade.</p>
