                    <h1>Cuscuta californica var. breviflora</h1>
<p>Cuscuta californica var. breviflora, commonly known as the California dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks leaves, roots, and chlorophyll.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to host plants using specialized structures called haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It is native to California and has a widespread distribution across the western United States.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
