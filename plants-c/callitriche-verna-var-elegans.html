<p>Callitriche verna var. elegans, commonly known as the spring water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant features tiny, star-shaped flowers that are often submerged or floating, with four to six petals. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, arranged in whorls around the stem.</p>
<p>It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
