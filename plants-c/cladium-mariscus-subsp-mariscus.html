<p>Cladium mariscus subsp.</p>
<p>mariscus, commonly known as sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It is characterized by its long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often used for thatching and basket weaving.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and swamps, where it forms dense stands. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize large areas and stabilize soil.</p>
<p>The inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family.</p>
