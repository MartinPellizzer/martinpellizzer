<p>Carex salina var. epigejos, commonly known as salt meadow sedge, is a variant of the common saltgrass.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal areas, particularly in the United States and parts of Europe. The plant typically grows in saline or brackish wetlands, thriving in high-salinity environments. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-ranked spikelets, which are characteristic of the Carex genus.</p>
