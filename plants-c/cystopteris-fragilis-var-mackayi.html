                    <h1>Cystopteris fragilis var. mackayi</h1>
<p>Cystopteris fragilis var. mackayi, commonly known as the Mackay's brittle fern, is a delicate fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds that are typically light green and somewhat translucent. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it can receive adequate humidity. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the fern family.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its fragility, as the fronds tend to break easily, contributing to its common name.</p>
