                    <h1>Cremolobus</h1>
<p>Cremolobus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with elongated, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, which is crucial for its survival in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cremolobus is considered endangered, making it a subject of conservation interest.</p>
