<p>Chenopodium stuckertii, commonly known as desert goosefoot, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments, often growing on rocky soils or in disturbed areas. Its leaves are typically lobed or deeply divided, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into dry, three-lobed fruits.</p>
<p>Chenopodium stuckertii is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
