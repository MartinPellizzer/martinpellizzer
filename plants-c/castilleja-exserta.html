                <h1>Castilleja exserta</h1>
<p>Castilleja exserta, commonly known as the exserted milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with other plants, drawing nutrients from them, which is a key feature of its parasitic nature.</p>
<p>Castilleja exserta plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores.</p>
