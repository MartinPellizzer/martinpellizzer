                    <h1>Ctenitis excelsa</h1>
<p>Ctenitis excelsa, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a striking member of the Cyatheaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. This plant is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, a unique feature that helps in attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a symbol of resilience and longevity in its native habitats.</p>
