<p>Conophytum intermedium, commonly known as the "Cape Rims" or "Rocky Rims," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the summer months. It typically grows in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, forming dense clusters that help it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Conophytum intermedium is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
