<p>Cenchrus yemensis, commonly known as Yemen grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry climates.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
