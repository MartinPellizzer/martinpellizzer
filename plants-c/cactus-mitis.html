                    <h1>Cactus mitis</h1>
<p>Cactus mitis, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has a cylindrical stem that is typically green and covered in small, white spines. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Cactus mitis is adapted to store water in its stem, allowing it to survive prolonged periods of drought.</p>
