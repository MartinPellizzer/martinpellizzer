                    <h1>Cheilanthes geraniifolia</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes geraniifolia, commonly known as the fern moss or the rock fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has small, closely spaced leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures, which help retain moisture. It is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense, and instead relies on rhizoids for anchorage.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes geraniifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
