<p>Clypeola minima, commonly known as the miniature clypeola, is a small, perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Clypeola minima is often found in moist, shaded environments, growing in rocky or forested soils.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution and delicate structure make it a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>
