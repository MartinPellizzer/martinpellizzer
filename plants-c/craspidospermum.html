                    <h1>Craspidospermum</h1>
<p>Craspidospermum, commonly known as the star-shaped liverwort, is a genus of non-vascular plants belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their intricate, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically flat and lobed. Craspidospermum species are often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. They reproduce through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>The genus is notable for its morphological diversity and ecological importance in nutrient cycling within humid ecosystems.</p>
