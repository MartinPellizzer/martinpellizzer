                    <h1>Citrus × aurantium var. saponacea</h1>
<p>Citrus × aurantium var. saponacea, commonly known as the soap orange, is a variant of the citron plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fragrant, and slightly bitter peel, which contains high levels of saponins, giving it its distinctive soap-like scent. The fruit is typically small, round, and has a rough, yellowish-green exterior. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its aromatic rind rather than its pulp.</p>
<p>The plant is valued in traditional medicine and aromatherapy for its essential oils and phytochemical properties.</p>
