                    <h1>Cyanospermum</h1>
<p>Cyanospermum, commonly known as the blue spirillum, is a genus of cyanobacteria that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>These microorganisms are capable of photosynthesis and are often found in aquatic environments. They possess a spiral-shaped morphology, which distinguishes them from other cyanobacterial species. Cyanospermum is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to nutrient cycling in ecosystems.</p>
<p>Their simple cellular structure and ancient evolutionary lineage make them important subjects in the study of early life forms.</p>
