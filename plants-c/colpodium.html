                    <h1>Colpodium</h1>
<p>Colpodium, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. Colpodium species are typically found in wetlands, ponds, and other moist environments. They are carnivorous plants, relying on the trapped prey for nutrients due to nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Colpodium corymbosum, which is native to North America.</p>
