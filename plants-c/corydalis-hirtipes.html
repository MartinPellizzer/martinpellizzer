<p>Corydalis hirtipes, commonly known as the hairy corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant features slender, ascending stems and lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, giving it its common name. Corydalis hirtipes is often found in rocky or forested habitats at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it is primarily appreciated for its botanical interest rather than its horticultural use.</p>
