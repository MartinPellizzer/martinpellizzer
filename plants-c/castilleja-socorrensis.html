<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vivid red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.

It is often found in rocky soils and arid environments, thriving in areas with low precipitation.</p>
<p>Castilleja socorrensis plays a role in pollination and is an important component of its native ecosystem.</p>
