                    <h1>Cuscuta epithymum var. alba</h1>
<p>Cuscuta epithymum var. alba, commonly known as white dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, white, spherical flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant is often found growing on the stems of various agricultural and wild plants, such as wheat and barley. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and is considered a weed in many regions.</p>
