<p>Ceratophyllum haynaldianum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It has whorled leaves that are narrow and linear, often with a slight serration along the edges. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically found in clusters, and it is often found in still or slow-moving waters. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
