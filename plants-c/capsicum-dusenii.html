                    <h1>Capsicum dusenii</h1>
<p>Capsicum dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's chili, is a rare and lesser-known species of capsicum native to the highlands of northern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elongated fruits that range in color from green to red when mature. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in cooler temperatures. Its botanical features include hairy stems and leaves, and it produces small, white flowers that are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
