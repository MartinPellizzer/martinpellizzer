<p>Cordia kirkii, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, ovate leaves that turn red or orange before falling in the dry season. The plant produces clusters of white, waxy flowers that resemble snowballs, which bloom in late winter or early spring. These flowers give way to spherical, green fruits that turn red when mature, containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Cordia kirkii is often found in savannas and woodland areas, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various wildlife.</p>
