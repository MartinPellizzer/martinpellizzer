                    <h1>Congea × munirii</h1>
<p>Congea × munirii, commonly known as the hybrid Chinese lantern plant, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Congea paniculata and Congea diffusa, both native to Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its striking, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are typically bright orange or red in color. These bracts are not true flowers but serve to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a potted plant due to its vibrant appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
