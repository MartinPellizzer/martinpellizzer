                    <h1>Callitriche palustris var. minima</h1>
<p>Callitriche palustris var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to wetlands and slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water, often forming dense mats on the surface or submerged vegetation. The plant has small, floating or submersed leaves that are opposite and lance-shaped, with a smooth margin. It produces tiny, white flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>This variant is characterized by its smaller size compared to the typical form of Callitriche palustris, making it well adapted to limited space in aquatic environments.</p>
