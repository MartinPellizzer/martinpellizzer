                    <h1>Cyperus rotundus var. carinalis</h1>
<p>Cyperus rotundus var. carinalis, commonly known as bulbous flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread aggressively in wet or moist soils. It is often found in marshy areas, rice fields, and along waterways.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural settings.</p>
