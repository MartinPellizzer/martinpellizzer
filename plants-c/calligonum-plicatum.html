                    <h1>Calligonum plicatum</h1>
<p>Calligonum plicatum, commonly known as the wrinkled saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Calligonum plicatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in saline and degraded areas.</p>
