                    <h1>Castilleja breweri var. pallida</h1>
<p>Castilleja breweri var. pallida, commonly known as the pallid milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a slender, branching stem and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to draw nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants, contributing to its survival in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
