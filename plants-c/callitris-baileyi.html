                    <h1>Callitris baileyi</h1>
<p>Callitris baileyi, commonly known as the coastal rosewood, is a species of conifer native to the coastal regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with a dense, spreading crown. The plant has scale-like leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs, and its cones are woody and persist on the tree for several years. It is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden winds, making it a hardy species found in coastal dunes and heathlands.</p>
<p>The wood of Callitris baileyi is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, though it is now considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and overharvesting.</p>
