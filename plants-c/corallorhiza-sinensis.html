                    <h1>Corallorhiza sinensis</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese coralroot, is a species of orchid that lacks chlorophyll and is therefore entirely dependent on mycorrhizal fungi for its nutrition.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests. The plant produces small, pink or reddish flowers that are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with fungi, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>Corallorhiza sinensis is native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
