                    <h1>Carex scirpoidea var. stenochlaena</h1>
<p>Carex scirpoidea var. stenochlaena, commonly known as narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial sedge native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features grass-like, narrow leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy, growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers in the summer, which are followed by cylindrical, three-sided seed heads. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its more compact growth compared to the typical form of Carex scirpoidea.</p>
