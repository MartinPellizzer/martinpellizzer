                    <h1>Commersonia borealis</h1>
<p>Commersonia borealis, commonly known as the Antarctic hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Antarctica.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming perennial that thrives in the extreme cold and nutrient-poor soils of its environment. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the Southern Hemisphere. Its leaves are short and dense, helping to reduce water loss in the dry, windy conditions.</p>
<p>Commersonia borealis plays a minor but ecologically significant role in the sparse vegetation of Antarctica's coastal areas.</p>
