                            <h1>Callicoma Serratifolia F. Ferruginea</h1>
<p>Red-leafed cootamundra wattle, scientifically known as Callicoma serratifolia f. ferruginea, is a strikingly beautiful and rare plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. This unique variety of the cootamundra wattle is distinguished by its vivid red foliage, which contrasts sharply with its green stems and yellow flowers. Found primarily in the southern parts of New South Wales, it thrives in sandy soils and coastal environments. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this plant is becoming increasingly threatened, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a significant species worthy of further study and protection.</p>
