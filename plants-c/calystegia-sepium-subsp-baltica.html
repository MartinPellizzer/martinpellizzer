<p>Calystegia sepium subsp.</p>
<p>baltica, commonly known as the Baltic bindweed, is a perennial vine native to eastern Europe and parts of Russia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers with five petals.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its strong, twining stems that can climb and spread aggressively. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wet meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
