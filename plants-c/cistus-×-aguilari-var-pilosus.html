                    <h1>Cistus × aguilari var. pilosus</h1>
<p>Cistus × aguilari var. pilosus, commonly known as the silky rockrose, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, limestone soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Its aromatic leaves and resilience to drought make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and traditional herbal uses.</p>
