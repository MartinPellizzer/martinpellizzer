                    <h1>Carex ternaria f. pallida</h1>
<p>Carex ternaria f. pallida, commonly known as the pale leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its pale, almost white-colored leaves distinguish it from other Carex species, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability to aquatic environments.</p>
