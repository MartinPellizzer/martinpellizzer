                    <h1>Circaea lutetiana</h1>
<p>Circaea lutetiana, commonly known as the white sandplant, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as heaths and woodland edges. Its small, oval-shaped leaves are arranged in whorls around the stem, and it is often found in association with other early-successional plant species.</p>
<p>Circaea lutetiana is also known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a common indicator plant in certain ecological communities.</p>
