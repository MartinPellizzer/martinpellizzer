<p>Carex goodenowii var. intricata, commonly known as the intricate sedge, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant prefers moist to wet soils and partial to full shade, making it a common sight in swampy or wetland environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>This species is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and ornamental appeal.</p>
