                    <h1>Capsicum longum</h1>
<p>Capsicum longum, commonly known as the long pepper or Indian long pepper, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It produces small, elongated fruits that are typically harvested when they are still green, though they can be allowed to ripen to a yellow or red color. The plant is valued for its pungent, spicy flavor, which comes from the alkaloid capsaicin found in its fruits. Its botanical characteristics include simple, alternate leaves and a branching structure that supports its fruiting habit.</p>
<p>Capsicum longum is often cultivated for both culinary and medicinal purposes.</p>
