                    <h1>Coffea callmanderi</h1>
<p>Coffea callmanderi, commonly known as the Callmander's coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the highlands of southern China, specifically Yunnan Province. This plant is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and produces small, white flowers that eventually develop into red berries. The berries contain seeds that are used to make coffee, though it is not as widely cultivated as other coffee species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coffea callmanderi is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
