                    <h1>Cryophytum paulum</h1>
<p>Cryophytum paulum, commonly known as the Antarctic hairgrass, is a unique flowering plant native to the extreme environments of Antarctica.</p>
<p>It is one of the few flowering plants known to survive in the harsh, cold, and nutrient-poor conditions of the continent. The plant has a compact growth form, with small, dense tufts of grass-like leaves that help it retain heat and moisture. Its flowers are inconspicuous, typically appearing as small, greenish structures that bloom during the brief Antarctic summer.</p>
<p>Cryophytum paulum plays a vital role in the local ecosystem, providing food and habitat for specialized invertebrates.</p>
