                    <h1>Castanea vesca var. albida</h1>
<p>Castanea vesca var. albida, commonly known as the white-flowered horse chestnut.</p>
<p>This variant is a cultivar of the horse chestnut tree, characterized by its pale, almost white flowers that contrast with the typical deep red or pink blooms of the species. It is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks. The leaves are palmately compound, with five to seven leaflets, and the tree produces spiny, spherical fruits containing edible seeds.</p>
<p>While it shares many features with the common horse chestnut, its unique floral coloration makes it a distinctive and sought-after ornamental plant.</p>
