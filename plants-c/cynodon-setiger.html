<p>Cynodon setiger, commonly known as the hairy grass or African dogstail, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, slightly hairy leaves that are often rolled when dry.

It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Cynodon setiger is often used in erosion control and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and rapid growth.</p>
