                    <h1>Celosia macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Celosia macrocarpa, commonly known as the flame flower or crown of thorns, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers inside the bract clusters, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It is a succulent plant with thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Celosia macrocarpa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to withstand drought.</p>
