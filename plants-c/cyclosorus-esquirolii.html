<p>Cyclosorus esquirolii, commonly known as the Esquiroli's water clover, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually submerged, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>
