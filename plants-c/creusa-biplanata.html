<p>Creusa biplanata, commonly known as the two-leaved creusa, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed leaves that are often hairy and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Creusa biplanata is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
