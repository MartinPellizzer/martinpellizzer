                    <h1>Chthamalia nummularia</h1>
<p>Chthamalia nummularia, commonly known as the pennywort, is a small, green algal species that forms dense, circular mats on rocky substrates in marine environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in intertidal zones, where it is exposed to fluctuating salinity and temperature conditions. The plant's thallus is typically flat and disc-shaped, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
<p>Chthamalia nummularia is often found in association with other algae and is an indicator species for certain types of rocky shores.</p>
