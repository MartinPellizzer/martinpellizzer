<p>Coleocephalocereus buxbaumianus subsp.</p>
<p>buxbaumianus, commonly known as the Buxbaum's night blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a tall, columnar cactus with a smooth, pale green stem that can grow up to several meters in height.</p>
<p>The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The cactus is adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in dry climates.</p>
