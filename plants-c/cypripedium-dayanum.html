                    <h1>Cypripedium dayanum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium dayanum, commonly known as the Dayan lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white with a yellowish lip, and it blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is highly threatened in the wild.</p>
