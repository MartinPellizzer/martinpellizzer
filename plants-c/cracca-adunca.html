                    <h1>Cracca adunca</h1>
<p>Cracca adunca, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cracca adunca is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
