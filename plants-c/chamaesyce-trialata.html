<p>Chamaesyce trialata, commonly known as the redstem sandmat, is a low-growing annual herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically features prostrate stems covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are usually oblanceolate with a waxy coating. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in disturbed areas.</p>
