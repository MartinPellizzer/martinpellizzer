                    <h1>Calligonum leucocladum</h1>
<p>Calligonum leucocladum, commonly known as white-flowered saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is well adapted to salty and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for reclaiming degraded land. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for use in xeriscaping and erosion control.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary ecological role is in stabilizing soils in harsh environments.</p>
