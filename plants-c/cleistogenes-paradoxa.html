                    <h1>Cleistogenes paradoxa</h1>
<p>Cleistogenes paradoxa, commonly known as the paradoxical bluebunch wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, tufted foliage, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces spikelets that are often hidden within the leaf sheaths, a feature that contributes to its common name. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, enhancing its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Cleistogenes paradoxa is an important component of native grassland ecosystems and is valued for its ecological and forage qualities.</p>
