                    <h1>Cylindropuntia × viridiflora</h1>
<p>Cylindropuntia × viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered prickly pear, is a hybrid cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or green flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray foliage. Its stems are capable of photosynthesis, a common trait in cacti, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is also known for its ability to form dense colonies, making it both an ornamental plant and a potential weed in certain regions.</p>
