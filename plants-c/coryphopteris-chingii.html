<p>Coryphopteris chingii, commonly known as the Chinese cliff brake, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on cliffs or rocky outcrops. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Coryphopteris chingii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
