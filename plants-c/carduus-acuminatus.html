<p>Carduus acuminatus, commonly known as the thistleweed or prickly thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with deeply lobed, silvery-green leaves that are covered in stiff, prickly hairs. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, producing small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Carduus acuminatus is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry meadows, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
