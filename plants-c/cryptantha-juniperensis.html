<p>Cryptantha juniperensis, commonly known as the juniper bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and clusters of small, blue or purple flowers. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
