                    <h1>Cephalantheropsis lateriscapa</h1>
<p>Cephalantheropsis lateriscapa, commonly known as the late-flowering ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom late in the season. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are often clustered at the top of the stem, and the species is noted for its delicate appearance and specialized pollination mechanisms.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
