<p>Cicerbita, commonly known as the bittercress, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae.</p>

The leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and the flowers are usually bright yellow or white. Cicerbita species are known for their peppery or bitter taste, which is due to the presence of glucosinolates.</p>
