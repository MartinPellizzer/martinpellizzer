                    <h1>Cyathea subtripinnata</h1>
<p>Cyathea subtripinnata, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots. The plant produces large, compound fronds that are divided into numerous narrow, linear segments. Cyathea subtripinnata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it a valuable component of ecological studies and horticultural collections.</p>
