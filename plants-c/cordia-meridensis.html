                    <h1>Cordia meridensis</h1>
<p>Cordia meridensis, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Cordia meridensis is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
