                    <h1>Cunila crenata</h1>
<p>Cunila crenata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cudweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Cunila crenata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
