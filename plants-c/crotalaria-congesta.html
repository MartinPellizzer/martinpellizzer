                    <h1>Crotalaria congesta</h1>
<p>Crotalaria congesta, commonly known as the clustered crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant characterized by its erect growth habit and palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish to orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a hard, ridged capsule, and the plant has a shallow root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Crotalaria congesta is often found in disturbed habitats, including roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
