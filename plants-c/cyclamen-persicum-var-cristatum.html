                    <h1>Cyclamen persicum var. cristatum</h1>
<p>Cyclamen persicum var. cristatum, commonly known as the crinkled cyclamen, is a unique variant of the Persian cyclamen characterized by its distinctive, ruffled foliage.</p>
<p>This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are typically pink or white, with a spurred petal that adds to its ornamental appeal. The crinkled leaves are a result of a genetic mutation that causes the leaves to curl and form a crinkled pattern.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated as a decorative plant for indoor or outdoor use during the winter months.</p>
