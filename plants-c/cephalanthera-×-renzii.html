<p>Cephalanthera × renzii, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cephalanthera damasonium and Cephalanthera falcata, showcasing a blend of characteristics from both parents. The plant is notable for its showy, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the genus Cephalanthera. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
