<p>Cryophytum excavatum, commonly known as the Antarctic pearlwort, is a flowering plant native to the extreme environments of Antarctica.</p>
<p>It is a small, low-growing plant that thrives in the harsh conditions of the continent's cold, dry climate. The plant has succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It produces small, white flowers that bloom during the brief Antarctic summer.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it one of the few flowering plants capable of surviving in such an extreme environment.</p>
