<p>Conopodium setaceum, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. It has slender, branching stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged.</p>
<p>Conopodium setaceum is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the nutrients obtained from captured prey.</p>
