                    <h1>Coeloneurum eggersii</h1>
<p>Coeloneurum eggersii, commonly known as the Eggers' spider orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its intricate, spider-like floral structure, which features a slender, twisted column and elongated, hairy sepals. Its flowers are typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive, recurved lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coeloneurum eggersii is considered vulnerable and is often protected in conservation efforts.</p>
