                    <h1>Cupressus rushforthii</h1>
<p>Cupressus rushforthii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre cypress, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and scale-like foliage that is dense and dark green. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. Its bark is reddish-brown and exfoliates to reveal a smooth, pale inner layer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
