                    <h1>Campanula saxifraga f. stenophylla</h1>
<p>Campanula saxifraga f. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the alpine regions of the European Alps.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish pubescence. This variety is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
