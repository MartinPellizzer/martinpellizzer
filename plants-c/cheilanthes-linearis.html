                    <h1>Cheilanthes linearis</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes linearis, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a perennial evergreen fern that typically grows on rock surfaces or in crevices, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has narrow, linear fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length, with a leathery texture that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, clustered spore clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are released during dry seasons.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes linearis is well-suited for xerophytic environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature.</p>
