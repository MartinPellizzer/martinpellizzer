                    <h1>Corallobotrys acuminata</h1>
<p>Corallobotrys acuminata, commonly known as the slender coralroot, is an epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically short-lived. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, enabling it to absorb nutrients from the forest floor.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth requirements, it is often found in shaded, moist environments within mature hardwood forests.</p>
