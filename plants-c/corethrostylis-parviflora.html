                    <h1>Corethrostylis parviflora</h1>
<p>Corethrostylis parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its green stems for photosynthesis. The plant attaches to its host, typically eucalyptus trees, through specialized roots called haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. Its small, white or cream-colored flowers appear in clusters and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds, contributing to its ecological role in the ecosystem.</p>
