<p>Catasetum osculatum, commonly known as the orchid bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that resemble the bodies of orchid bees. The plant produces a unique structure called a gynostemium, which is a fused column of reproductive organs. Its flowers are pollinated by orchid bees, which are attracted by the scent and appearance of the blooms.</p>
<p>Catasetum osculatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in supporting pollinator species.</p>
