<p>Cuscuta lindsayi, commonly known as the Lindsay's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to parts of the southwestern United States and Mexico. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means.</p>
<p>Cuscuta lindsayi plays a role in its ecosystem by influencing the growth and distribution of its host plants.</p>
