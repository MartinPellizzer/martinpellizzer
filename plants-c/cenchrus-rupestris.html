                    <h1>Cenchrus rupestris</h1>
<p>Cenchrus rupestris, commonly known as the rock grass or desert grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, narrow leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered at the base of the stem, with small, tough bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is considered a valuable plant for erosion control in dry environments.</p>
