                    <h1>Callitriche stenoptera</h1>
<p>Callitriche stenoptera, commonly known as narrow-leaved water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant has narrow, opposite leaves that are often submerged, with small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its stems are usually prostrate or floating, allowing it to spread across the water's surface.</p>
<p>Callitriche stenoptera plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through oxygen production.</p>
