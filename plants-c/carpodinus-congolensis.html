                    <h1>Carpodinus congolensis</h1>
<p>Carpodinus congolensis, commonly known as the Congo water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and West Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as marshes and wetlands, where it attaches itself to submerged surfaces. The plant has finely divided, ribbon-like fronds that float on the water's surface, contributing to its aesthetic appeal in aquatic habitats. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, spore-producing clusters along the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
