                    <h1>Ctenopteris immersa</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris immersa, commonly known as the water hakea, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged in water, adapting to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. The plant has a creeping rhizome that helps it spread across wetland environments, forming dense colonies. Its spores are produced in sori that are covered by a thin, membranous indusium, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Ctenopteris immersa thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater, making it a common sight in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams.</p>
