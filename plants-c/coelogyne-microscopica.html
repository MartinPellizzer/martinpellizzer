                    <h1>Coelogyne microscopica</h1>
<p>Coelogyne microscopica, commonly known as the miniature coelogyne, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant has a compact growth habit, with a pseudobulb that supports its foliage and flowering structure. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Coelogyne microscopica is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
