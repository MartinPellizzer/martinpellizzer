                            <h1>Castilleja Exserta</h1>
<p>Interior paintbrush, scientifically known as Castilleja exserta, is a striking member of the Orobanchaceae family native to the western United States. This hemiparasitic plant is characterized by its vivid red and orange flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often growing alongside other wildflowers. Despite its name, it is not related to the paintbrush family but gets its name from the shape of its flowers resembling a paintbrush. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a fascinating subject for botanists and nature enthusiasts alike.</p>
