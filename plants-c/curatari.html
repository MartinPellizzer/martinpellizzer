                    <h1>Curatari</h1>
<p>Curatari, commonly known as the "Brazilian rosewood," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their woody stems and compound leaves. Curatari species often produce small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. The genus includes several species, such as Curatari macrophylla, which is valued for its hard, durable wood.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, many Curatari species are now threatened with extinction.</p>
