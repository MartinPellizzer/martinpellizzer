<p>Cereus fernambucensis subsp.</p>
<p>sericifer, commonly known as the white-spined cactus, is a rare and specialized cactus native to the high-altitude regions of Argentina. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are often covered with white, woolly spines, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in arid, rocky environments and requires well-drained soil and minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
