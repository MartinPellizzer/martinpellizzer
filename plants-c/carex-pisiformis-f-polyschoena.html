                    <h1>Carex pisiformis f. polyschoena</h1>
<p>Carex pisiformis f. polyschoena, commonly known as the broad-leaf sedge, is a distinctive variant of the Carex genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its wide, grass-like leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical form. This plant produces spikelets that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, typical of many sedges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects.</p>
