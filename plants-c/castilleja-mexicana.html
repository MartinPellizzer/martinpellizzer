<p>Castilleja mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in spring. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for nutrients, often growing on the roots of grasses or shrubs. Its structure consists of a short stem with whorled flowers and bracts that resemble paintbrush bristles.</p>
<p>Castilleja mexicana plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
