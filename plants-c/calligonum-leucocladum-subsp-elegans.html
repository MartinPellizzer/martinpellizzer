<p>Calligonum leucocladum subsp.</p>
<p>elegans, commonly known as the white-flowered saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and showy white flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. It has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
