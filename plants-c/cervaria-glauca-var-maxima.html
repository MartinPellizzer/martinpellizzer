<p>Cervaria glauca var. maxima, commonly known as the giant bluebush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and blue-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, reducing water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pale blue or white seed pods. It is adapted to harsh, dry environments and has deep root systems to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
