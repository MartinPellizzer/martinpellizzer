                    <h1>Calanthe crenulata</h1>
<p>Calanthe crenulata, commonly known as the serrated calanthe, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it receives dappled sunlight. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form compact, bushy clumps over time.</p>
<p>Calanthe crenulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its beauty and resilience.</p>
