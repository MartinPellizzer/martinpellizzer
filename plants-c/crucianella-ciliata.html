<p>Crucianella ciliata, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient uptake. The plant typically grows in shallow, brackish or freshwater environments, such as marshes and coastal areas. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowers are small and usually white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Crucianella ciliata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
