The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically pink to purple in color, adding visual interest to its habitat. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cousinia cylindrocephala is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
