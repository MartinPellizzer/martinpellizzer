<p>Cereus fercheckii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong fragrance to attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help it conserve water in arid environments.</p>
<p>Cereus fercheckii is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
