                    <h1>Cypripedium knightae</h1>
<p>Cypripedium knightae, commonly known as the Knight's lady's tresses, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, pleated leaves and a single, showy, pinkish-white flower with a distinctive yellow lip. The plant typically grows in cool, moist forest habitats, often in shaded areas with rich, well-drained soil. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake, which contributes to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
