<p>Cladocolea primaria, commonly known as the coastal lichen, is a lichen that forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It is typically found in coastal areas where it thrives on rock surfaces exposed to salt spray and high humidity. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic partnership of the fungal and algal components. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized environment, Cladocolea primaria is often used as an indicator species for coastal ecological health.</p>
