                    <h1>Calamagrostis megalantha</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis megalantha, commonly known as the giant calamagrass, is a tall perennial grass native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland or moist habitats, often found near water bodies such as marshes and riverbanks. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces dense clusters of spikelets that are often pink or purple in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Calamagrostis megalantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects.</p>
