<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typically in late summer. Its growth habit is low and spreading, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
