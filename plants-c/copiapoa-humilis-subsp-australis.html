<p>Copiapoa humilis subsp.</p>
<p>australis, commonly known as the Huacachina cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is well adapted to extreme drought, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
