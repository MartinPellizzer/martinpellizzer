<p>Casalea phyteumifolia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
