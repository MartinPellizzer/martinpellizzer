<p>Crotalaria psammophila, commonly known as the desert crownflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact clusters, which bloom during the dry season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Crotalaria psammophila is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in degraded landscapes.</p>
