<p>Crassula pubescens, commonly known as the Wooly Crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, rounded leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It is often grown as a houseplant due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Crassula pubescens thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil.</p>
