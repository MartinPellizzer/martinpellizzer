<p>Castilleja venusta, commonly known as the showy Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red, orange, or yellow flowers that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for water and nutrients, often growing on grasses or shrubs. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria to attach to the roots of its host.</p>
<p>Castilleja venusta is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
