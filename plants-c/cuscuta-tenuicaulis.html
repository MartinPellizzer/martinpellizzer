                    <h1>Cuscuta tenuicaulis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta tenuicaulis, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hairless stems. The plant attaches to its host using specialized haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. It is commonly found in agricultural areas and can infest a variety of crops.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to its host plants.</p>
