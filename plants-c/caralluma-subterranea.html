                    <h1>Caralluma subterranea</h1>
<p>Caralluma subterranea, commonly known as the underground fig or desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom at night, and its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule containing seeds. It has adapted to extreme temperatures and low rainfall through its thick, waxy leaves and deep root system.</p>
<p>Caralluma subterranea is also known for its traditional use in herbal medicine for its purported appetite-suppressing properties.</p>
