<p>Chaetolepis nana, commonly known as the dwarf chaetolepis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cold, nutrient-poor environments. The plant has a low, mat-forming growth habit with numerous short, stiff stems. Its small, spoon-shaped leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the short growing season of summer.</p>
