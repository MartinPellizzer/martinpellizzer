                    <h1>Calamus notabilis</h1>
<p>Calamus notabilis, commonly known as the giant reed or giant arum, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters, making it a prominent feature in wetland and marsh environments. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and a distinctive, often fragrant, inflorescence. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a significant ecological concern in non-native regions.</p>
