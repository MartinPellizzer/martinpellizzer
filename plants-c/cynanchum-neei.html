<p>Cynanchum neei, commonly known as the Chinese milkweed or the Chinese snake's head, is a perennial herb native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by follicles containing toxic seeds.
