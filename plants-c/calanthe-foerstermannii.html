                    <h1>Calanthe foerstermannii</h1>
<p>Calanthe foerstermannii, commonly known as the Foerstermann's calanthe, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette, and it has a short, underground rhizome.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
