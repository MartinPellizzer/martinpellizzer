                    <h1>Connarus tricholobus</h1>
<p>Connarus tricholobus, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. Connarus tricholobus is also noted for its ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
