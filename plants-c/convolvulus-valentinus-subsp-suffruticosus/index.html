                            <h1>Convolvulus Valentinus Subsp. Suffruticosus</h1>
<p>Convolvulus valentinus subsp. suffruticosus is a unique and often overlooked member of the bindweed family. It is known for its trailing growth habit and vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its common name, "Valentine's convolvulus," hints at its romantic association with the holiday. Despite its beauty, it can be invasive in some regions, requiring careful management.</p>
