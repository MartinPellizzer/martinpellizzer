                    <h1>Cytisogenista scoparia var. leiostylos</h1>
<p>Cytisogenista scoparia var. leiostylos, commonly known as the silky broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a slender, branched stem and produces small, scale-like leaves that are often inconspicuous. It is found in various habitats across Europe and parts of Asia, typically in open, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem by influencing the growth and distribution of its host plants.</p>
