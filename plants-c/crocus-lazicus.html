                    <h1>Crocus lazicus</h1>
<p>Crocus lazicus, commonly known as the Persian crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking violet or blue flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent. The plant blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, making it a notable early-flowering species. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in arid conditions, storing moisture and nutrients for extended periods.</p>
<p>The Persian crocus is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
