                    <h1>Cordula rothschildiana</h1>
<p>Cordula rothschildiana, commonly known as the Rothschild's cordula, is a unique and rare plant species native to the arid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly known as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss and reflects sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cordula rothschildiana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
