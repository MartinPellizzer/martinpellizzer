                    <h1>Cochlearia saxatilis f. diminuta</h1>
<p>Cochlearia saxatilis f. diminuta, commonly known as the dwarf rock scabious, is a compact, low-growing plant native to coastal regions of the British Isles.</p>
<p>It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its rocky, maritime habitat. It is often found growing in crevices or on cliffs, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its smaller size compared to the typical form of Cochlearia saxatilis.</p>
