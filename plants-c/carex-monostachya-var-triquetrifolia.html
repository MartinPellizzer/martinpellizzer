<p>Carex monostachya var. triquetrifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically green and arranged in a dense, compact cluster. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spike, which is a common feature among sedges. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland habitats.</p>
