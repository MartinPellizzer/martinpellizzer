<p>Cystopteris fragilis var. translucens, commonly known as the translucent water fern, is a delicate fern species characterized by its finely divided, translucent fronds.</p>
<p>It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and fertile fronds in the second. The plant's unique appearance, with its papery, light green leaves, makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and shady landscapes.</p>
<p>It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
