                    <h1>Conosapium</h1>
<p>Conosapium, commonly known as the African sycamore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sapotaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plants are characterized by their large, palmately lobed leaves and produce small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Conosapium species are often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along riverbanks.</p>
