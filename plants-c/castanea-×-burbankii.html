                    <h1>Castanea × burbankii</h1>
<p>Castanea × burbankii, commonly known as the Burbank chestnut, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollis) and the Japanese chestnut (Castanea crenata).</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its robust growth and cold hardiness, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. It produces large, edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks, similar to its parent species. The Burbank chestnut is valued for its resistance to chestnut blight, a significant disease that has devastated native chestnut populations.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in both ornamental horticulture and potential reforestation efforts.</p>
