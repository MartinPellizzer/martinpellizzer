                            <h1>Centaurea Salmantica Var. Clusii</h1>
<p>Clusius' centaury, scientifically known as Centaurea salmantica var. clusii, is a rare and striking plant native to southern Spain. It belongs to the sunflower family and is characterized by its vibrant blue and purple flower heads. This variety was named after the renowned 17th-century botanist and gardener Carolus Clusius, who played a significant role in the introduction of many exotic plants to Europe. The plant thrives in rocky and dry environments, making it a symbol of resilience in arid landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts.</p>
