                    <h1>Chlorochorion</h1>
<p>Chlorochorion, commonly known as the outermost layer of the seed coat in certain plants, is a specialized structure composed primarily of lignified cells.</p>
<p>It serves as a protective barrier against mechanical damage and desiccation during seed dormancy. The chlorochorion is often impermeable to water, which helps maintain the viability of the seed over long periods. In some species, it may contain pigments that contribute to the seed's coloration.</p>
<p>Its structure and composition vary depending on the plant species and environmental conditions.</p>
