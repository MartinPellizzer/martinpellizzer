                    <h1>Cytisus albus f. arenarius</h1>
<p>Cytisus albus f. arenarius, commonly known as the sandy broom, is a shrub characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It is adapted to grow in sandy or gravelly soils, making it a typical plant of coastal and dune environments. The leaves are typically small, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a splash of yellow to the landscape.</p>
<p>This form is a natural variant of the common broom, showing distinct morphological adaptations to its harsh habitat.</p>
