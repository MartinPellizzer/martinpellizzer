                    <h1>Cytisus albidus var. tridentatus</h1>
<p>Cytisus albidus var. tridentatus, commonly known as the white broom or tridentate broom, is a flowering shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, trifoliate leaves that give it its varietal name "tridentatus.". The plant produces clusters of yellow, pea-like flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas.</p>
