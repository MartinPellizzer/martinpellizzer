<p>It is native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly found in countries like Costa Rica and Panama. This plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it attaches to host trees and derives some of its nutrients from them while also performing photosynthesis. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Clidemia trichosantha produces small, white to pink flowers and is often found in shaded, humid environments within tropical forests.</p>
