                    <h1>Carpobrotus edulis var. rubescens</h1>
<p>Carpobrotus edulis var. rubescens, commonly known as the red-flowered ice plant, is a succulent perennial native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, trailing stems and vibrant red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in sandy soils.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
