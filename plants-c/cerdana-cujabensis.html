<p>Cerdana cujabensis, commonly known as the Cuja orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cerdana cujabensis is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
