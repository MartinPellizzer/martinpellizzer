                    <h1>Cota coelopoda</h1>
<p>Cota coelopoda, commonly known as the common snail, is a species of air-breathing land snail.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Helicidae and is characterized by its spiral shell and soft, gelatinous body. The plant-like appearance of its shell is a key botanical feature, though it is not a plant. Cota coelopoda thrives in moist environments, such as gardens and forests, where it feeds on leaves and decaying plant matter.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of a healthy, undisturbed ecosystem.</p>
