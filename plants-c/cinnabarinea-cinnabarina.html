<p>Cinnabarinea cinnabarina, commonly known as the red moss, is a unique species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and vibrant red or orange coloration, which is due to the presence of specific pigments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its structure consists of a thallus with leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are arranged in a distinctive pattern.</p>
<p>Cinnabarinea cinnabarina plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
