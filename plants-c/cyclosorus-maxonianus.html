<p>Cyclosorus maxonianus, commonly known as the Maxonian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Oleaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in diameter. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the water surface through vegetative propagation. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that give it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus maxonianus thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and marshy areas.</p>
