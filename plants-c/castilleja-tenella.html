                    <h1>Castilleja tenella</h1>
<p>Castilleja tenella, commonly known as the Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red-orange bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for water and nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe.</p>
<p>Castilleja tenella blooms in late spring to early summer, producing small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
