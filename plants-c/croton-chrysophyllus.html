The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, which are followed by woody, spiky capsules containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens.</p>
