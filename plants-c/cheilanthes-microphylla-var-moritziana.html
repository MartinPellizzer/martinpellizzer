                    <h1>Cheilanthes microphylla var. moritziana</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes microphylla var. moritziana, commonly known as the Moritz's rock fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to the rocky habitats of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered near the margins.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
