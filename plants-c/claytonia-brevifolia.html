                    <h1>Claytonia brevifolia</h1>
<p>Claytonia brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, oval leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its woodland habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, usually blooming in early spring. Its succulent leaves and short stature make it well adapted to moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Claytonia brevifolia is often found in rich, moist soils along stream banks and in forest understories.</p>
