                    <h1>Cynosurus elegans var. fertilis</h1>
<p>Cynosurus elegans var. fertilis, commonly known as the fertile bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
