                    <h1>Ctenitis sumbawensis</h1>
<p>Ctenitis sumbawensis, commonly known as the Sumbawa ctenophyllum, is a rare and unique member of the Davalliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a type of tree fern characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, frond-like leaves. Native to the Indonesian island of Sumbawa, it thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. The plant's distinctive fronds are dimorphic, with fertile and sterile fronds differing in structure and appearance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
