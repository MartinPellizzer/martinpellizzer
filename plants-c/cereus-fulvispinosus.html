<p>Cereus fulvispinosus, commonly known as the fiery candelabra cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a tall, branching stem that can grow up to several meters in height, adorned with clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant has spiny, ribbed stems that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for desert gardens.</p>
