                    <h1>Curcuma</h1>
<p>Curcuma, commonly known as turmeric, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant's underground stem, or rhizome, is the primary part used for its vibrant yellow-orange color and medicinal properties. Curcuma species are known for their aromatic leaves and showy, spike-like flowers that range in color from white to purple.</p>
<p>The active compound curcumin, found in the rhizome, is responsible for many of its health benefits and culinary uses.</p>
