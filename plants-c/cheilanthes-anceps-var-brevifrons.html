                    <h1>Cheilanthes anceps var. brevifrons</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes anceps var. brevifrons, commonly known as the short-snout rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to low moisture conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in crevices and on exposed rock surfaces, where it forms dense colonies.</p>
