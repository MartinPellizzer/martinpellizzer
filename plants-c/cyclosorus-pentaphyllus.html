<p>Cyclosorus pentaphyllus, commonly known as the five-leafed water clover, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into five pairs of narrow, ribbon-like segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus pentaphyllus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
