<p>Cardamine pratensis var. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy water-crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist meadows and stream sides in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of basal leaves with finely toothed margins and hairy surfaces, which contribute to its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in dense, floating clusters on long stalks. Its leaves are typically alternate, with a distinctive lobed shape and ciliate (hairy) edges.</p>
<p>It plays a role in supporting aquatic insect populations and is often found in wetland ecosystems.</p>
