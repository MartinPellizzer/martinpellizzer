                    <h1>Cypripedium × youngianum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × youngianum, commonly known as the young's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium micranthum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white with a yellow or orange lip. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form clumps, and it produces a single or few flowers per stem.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and rarity in the wild, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
