                    <h1>Cuscuta parodiana var. tucumana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta parodiana var. tucumana, commonly known as the Tucum√°n dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Bolivia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. It is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host.</p>
