<p>Campylogramma, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of small, terrestrial ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, often creeping fronds that form dense mats on rocky substrates. They typically thrive in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or on limestone outcrops. The fronds are usually divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments with a distinctive, curled appearance.</p>
<p>Campylogramma species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often used in horticultural settings where they can thrive in moist, well-drained soil.</p>
