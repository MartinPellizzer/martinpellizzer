                    <h1>Cypripedium daliense</h1>
<p>Cypripedium daliense, commonly known as the Dali lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a unique feature among orchids. The plant typically grows in cool, shaded forest habitats, often in moist, well-drained soils. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cypripedium daliense is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
