                    <h1>Chionolaena glaziovii</h1>
<p>Chionolaena glaziovii, commonly known as the silverleaf groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It features silvery-white, fuzzy leaves that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss, adapting it to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water.</p>
<p>Chionolaena glaziovii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
