<p>Chonemorpha elliptica, commonly known as the rock fig, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are elliptical in shape and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.

It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes.</p>
