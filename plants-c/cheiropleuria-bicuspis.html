                    <h1>Cheiropleuria bicuspis</h1>
<p>Cheiropleuria bicuspis, commonly known as the two-cusped fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it can receive adequate light without direct sun exposure. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cheiropleuria bicuspis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
