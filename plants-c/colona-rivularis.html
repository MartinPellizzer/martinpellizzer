                    <h1>Colona rivularis</h1>
<p>Colona rivularis, commonly known as the river colona, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows near water sources such as rivers, streams, and wetlands, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has slender, upright stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, often with a slightly hairy texture. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Colona rivularis produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are often overlooked but play a role in its reproductive cycle.</p>
