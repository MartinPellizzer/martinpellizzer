<p>Carduus × heteromorphus, commonly known as the horseweed or heteromorph thistle, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, which can range from spiny to lobed, and its purple to pinkish composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and ecology.</p>
