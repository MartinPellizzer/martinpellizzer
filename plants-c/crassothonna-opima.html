                    <h1>Crassothonna opima</h1>
<p>Crassothonna opima, commonly known as the Natal grass or Natal flat sedge, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands.</p>
<p>Crassothonna opima is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
