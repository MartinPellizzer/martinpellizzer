<p>Coccoloba pilonis, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are three-winged samaras that aid in wind dispersal. Coccoloba pilonis typically grows in coastal areas, including mangrove swamps and salt marshes, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to brackish water conditions makes it an important species in tropical and subtropical coastal ecosystems.</p>
