                    <h1>Centrapalus praemorsus</h1>
<p>Centrapalus praemorsus, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense, shaded understories of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in high humidity and requires consistently moist, well-drained soil rich in organic matter. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Centrapalus praemorsus is considered a rare and understudied species in botanical science.</p>
