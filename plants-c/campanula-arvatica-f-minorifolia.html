                    <h1>Campanula arvatica f. minorifolia</h1>
<p>Campanula arvatica f. minorifolia, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The leaves are narrow and lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more delicate leaves compared to the typical form of Campanula arvatica.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
