                    <h1>Celsia suworowiana var. papillosum</h1>
<p>Celsia suworowiana var. papillosum, commonly known as the papillate celsia, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spiny stems and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant exhibits a peculiar feature of having papillae—small, nipple-like projections—on its stems, which are believed to aid in water retention. Its flowers, typically red or orange, bloom in late summer and attract various pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
