<p>Callitropsis stephensonii, commonly known as the Stewart's cypress, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
