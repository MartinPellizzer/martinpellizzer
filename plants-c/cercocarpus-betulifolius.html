<p>Cercocarpus betulifolius, commonly known as the Sierra Madre buckthorn, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of a birch tree, hence its common name. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Cercocarpus betulifolius is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
