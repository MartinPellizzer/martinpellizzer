<p>Calyptrocalyx minor, commonly known as the small calyptrocalyx, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are often covered by a calyptra, a cap-like structure that protects the developing buds. Its leaves are typically opposite and elliptical, with a smooth texture and a mild aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, Calyptrocalyx minor is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
