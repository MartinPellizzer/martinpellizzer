                    <h1>Cyathea minor</h1>
<p>Cyathea minor, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, making it a long-lived species in its natural habitat. Cyathea minor prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizome system allows it to anchor itself firmly in the soil while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment.</p>
