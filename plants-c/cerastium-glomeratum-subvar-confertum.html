<p>Cerastium glomeratum subvar. confertum, commonly known as clustered mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that are oval to heart-shaped, and it produces small, spherical fruits known as achenes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a common sight in temperate regions where it contributes to the undergrowth vegetation.</p>
