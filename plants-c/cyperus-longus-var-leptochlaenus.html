                    <h1>Cyperus longus var. leptochlaenus</h1>
<p>Cyperus longus var. leptochlaenus, commonly known as slender flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. Its slender, triangular stems are covered with small, scale-like leaves, and it produces spikelets that are often clustered at the tips of the stems.</p>
<p>The botanical characteristics of this variant make it distinct from other Cyperus species, particularly in its leaf morphology and growth habit.</p>
