                    <h1>Crotalaria intricata</h1>
<p>Crotalaria intricata, commonly known as the intricate crotalaria, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its complex, branched inflorescences and showy yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with trifoliate leaves and hairy stems. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Crotalaria intricata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, and it plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
