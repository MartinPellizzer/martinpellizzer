<p>Chamaeanthus begaudii, commonly known as the Lesotho orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Lesotho.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats at high altitudes. The plant features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. It blooms during the cooler months, usually between July and October, and is adapted to the harsh, alpine climate of its native environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
