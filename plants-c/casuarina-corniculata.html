<p>Casuarina corniculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf she-oak, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are often mistaken for pine needles, and its distinctive, woody cones. The plant thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, cylindrical fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Casuarina corniculata is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental appearance.</p>
