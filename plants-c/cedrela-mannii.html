                    <h1>Cedrela mannii</h1>
<p>Cedrela mannii, commonly known as African teak, is a tropical tree native to western and central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its straight-grained, durable wood that is highly valued for furniture and construction. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
