<p>Calydorea undulata, commonly known as the undulating calydorea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, waxy leaves that exhibit a subtle undulating pattern along their margins. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the spring and early summer months. Calydorea undulata thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
