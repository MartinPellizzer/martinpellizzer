<p>Callista acinaciformis, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to spread and colonize moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Callista acinaciformis is often found in forest undergrowth, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions.</p>
