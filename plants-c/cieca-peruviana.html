                <h1>Cieca peruviana</h1>
<p>Cieca peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian cieca, is a unique plant native to the Andean regions of Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage that forms a water-holding cup. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy surface, which helps in retaining moisture in its arid habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden within the leaf rosette.</p>
<p>Cieca peruviana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
