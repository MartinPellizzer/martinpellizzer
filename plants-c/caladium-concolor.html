                    <h1>Caladium concolor</h1>
<p>Caladium concolor, commonly known as the white-veined caladium, is a tropical perennial plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are predominantly white with deep green veins. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, making it a popular choice for gardens and indoor spaces.</p>
<p>Caladium concolor is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than its flowers, which are small and inconspicuous.</p>
