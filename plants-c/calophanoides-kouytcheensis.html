<p>Calophanoides kouytcheensis, commonly known as the Kouytchean calophanoid, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the arid regions of northern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Calophanaceae, which includes a small group of epiphytic and lithophytic plants. The plant is characterized by its compact, succulent growth form and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental degradation and climate change.</p>
<p>Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of plant adaptation strategies in extreme environments.</p>
