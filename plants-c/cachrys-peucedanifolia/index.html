                            <h1>Cachrys Peucedanifolia</h1>
<p>Sweet cicely, scientifically known as Cachrys peucedanifolia, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender stems, finely divided leaves, and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. This plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and streamside areas. Despite its beauty, it is threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting, making conservation efforts essential for its survival. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a noteworthy subject for botanical study and environmental protection.</p>
