                    <h1>Colladonia microcarpa</h1>
<p>Colladonia microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is often found growing on the roots of various grasses and shrubs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal growth patterns of its host. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health and growth of its host plants.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
