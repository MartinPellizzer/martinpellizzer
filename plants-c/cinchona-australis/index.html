It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is known for its striking red and yellow flowers. This plant is part of the Rubiaceae family, which includes several economically important species. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research. Its conservation status highlights the importance of protecting native flora in its natural habitat.</p>
