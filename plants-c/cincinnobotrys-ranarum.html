<p>Cincinnobotrys ranarum, commonly known as the frogspawn liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as under rocks or on damp soil, often near water sources. The plant is characterized by its bright green thalloid structure, which is covered in small, leaf-like structures called rhizoids. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>Cincinnobotrys ranarum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
