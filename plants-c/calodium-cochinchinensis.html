<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam, and is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage rather than its small, inconspicuous flowers.

It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
<p>Calodium cochinchinensis is valued for its vibrant leaf patterns, which can range from white and pink to red and green.</p>
