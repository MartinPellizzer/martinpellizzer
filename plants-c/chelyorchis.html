<p>Chelyorchis, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nychthemeriaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that open in the morning and close at night. Chelyorchis species typically thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Their roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, while their leaves provide surface cover for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, each with unique floral structures and ecological roles in their native habitats.</p>
