<p>Cheilanthes pteridioides subsp.</p>
<p>guanchica, commonly known as the Canary Island rock fern, is a terrestrial fern endemic to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and small, pinnately compound leaves.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its resilience to drought and its role in the unique flora of the Canary Islands.</p>
