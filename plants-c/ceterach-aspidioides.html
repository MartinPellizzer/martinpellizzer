<p>Ceterach aspidioides, commonly known as the giant feather moss, is a species of liverwort found in coastal and wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth and dark green, leathery leaves that are often arranged in overlapping rows. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in association with other moisture-loving flora. Its structure consists of a thallus, which is the main body of the liverwort, and it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>Ceterach aspidioides plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
