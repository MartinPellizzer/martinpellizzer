                    <h1>Cuscuta ortegana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta ortegana, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its host to extract water and nutrients. The plant is native to the western United States and is often found growing on various shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to spread to new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants, making it a significant concern in agricultural and natural ecosystems.</p>
