                    <h1>Campium semicordatum</h1>
<p>Campium semicordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in wet environments.</p>
<p>Campium semicordatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
