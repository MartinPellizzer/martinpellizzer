                    <h1>Cycas chenii</h1>
<p>Cycas chenii, commonly known as the Chen's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to China, specifically found in the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province. This plant is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. Cycas chenii is a dioecious species, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones rather than flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
