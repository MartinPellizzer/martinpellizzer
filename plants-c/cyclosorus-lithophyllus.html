                    <h1>Cyclosorus lithophyllus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus lithophyllus, commonly known as the rock liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchaliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and is typically found growing on rocky surfaces in moist, shaded environments. This species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor substrates, often colonizing limestone and other calcareous rocks. Its morphology includes a dorsiventral thallus with distinct leaf-like structures arranged in a spiral pattern.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus lithophyllus plays a role in stabilizing rocky habitats and is an indicator species for certain ecological conditions.</p>
