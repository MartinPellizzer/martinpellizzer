<p>Chamaesyce polygonifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun.</p>
<p>Chamaesyce polygonifolia is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
