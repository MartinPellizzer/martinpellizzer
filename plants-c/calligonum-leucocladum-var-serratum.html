<p>Calligonum leucocladum var. serratum, commonly known as the sand spurge, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, fleshy, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
