                            <h1>Celmisia Glandulosa Var. Vera</h1>
<p>Celmisia glandulosa var. vera is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of New Zealand. It is known for its unique, glandular leaves and striking, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. This variant of Celmisia is particularly sought after by botanists and plant enthusiasts due to its limited distribution and ecological significance. Its survival is threatened by habitat loss and climate change, making conservation efforts crucial. Despite its small size, this plant plays an important role in its native ecosystem.</p>
