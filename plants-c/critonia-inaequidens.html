<p>Critonia inaequidens, commonly known as the unequal-stemmed critonia, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often asymmetrical growth pattern. The plant features long, strap-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base, and it produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers. Its botanical interest lies in its unusual morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of study in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in the wild.</p>
