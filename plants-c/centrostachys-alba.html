                    <h1>Centrostachys alba</h1>
<p>Centrostachys alba, commonly known as white centipede grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for ornamental use in gardens. It has a fine texture and forms a dense mat, which helps suppress weeds.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its centipede-like appearance, with its creeping growth habit and clustered flower spikes.</p>
