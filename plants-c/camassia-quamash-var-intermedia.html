<p>Camassia quamash var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate camas, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open meadows and woodland areas. Its leaves are grass-like and form a basal rosette, while its stems are erect and bear the showy inflorescences.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from the typical Camassia quamash by its intermediate flower size and coloration.</p>
