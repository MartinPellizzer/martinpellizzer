                    <h1>Croton fragilis var. genuinus</h1>
<p>Croton fragilis var. genuinus, commonly known as the brittle croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often brightly colored with shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
