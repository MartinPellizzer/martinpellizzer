<p>Coilonox roodeae, commonly known as the Red Rock Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Coilonox roodeae is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
