                    <h1>Carpodiptera cubensis</h1>
<p>Carpodiptera cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban orchid bee, is a species of bee native to Cuba.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apidae and is known for its role in pollination, particularly of orchids. The plant it interacts with, however, is not a plant but an animal, making it unique in its ecological role. It is characterized by its striking metallic blue coloration and is often seen visiting flowering plants for nectar.</p>
<p>Despite its name, it does not have a direct botanical relationship with any specific plant species.</p>
