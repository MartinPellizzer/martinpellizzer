                    <h1>Callitriche palustris var. dubia</h1>
<p>Callitriche palustris var. dubia, commonly known as the bog water-star, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds, ditches, and marshes, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features delicate, floating or submersed leaves that are often oval or lance-shaped, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its small, white or pink flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other members of the Callitriche genus, sharing similar morphological and ecological traits.</p>
