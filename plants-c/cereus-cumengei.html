<p>Cereus cumengei, commonly known as the Cumenge's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a tall, columnar cactus with a distinctive ribbed structure and spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a characteristic feature of many desert plants. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Cereus cumengei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in low-maintenance gardens.</p>
