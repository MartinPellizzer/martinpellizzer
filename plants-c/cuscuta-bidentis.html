                    <h1>Cuscuta bidentis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta bidentis, commonly known as the two-tooth dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth pattern, often forming dense mats on its host. The plant's stem is slender and covered with tiny, hair-like structures that help it adhere to its host. It is commonly found in agricultural fields and gardens, where it can cause significant damage to crops.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and establishing a connection with the vascular system of the host plant.</p>
