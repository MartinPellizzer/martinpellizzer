                    <h1>Capurodendron microlobum</h1>
<p>Capurodendron microlobum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of hardwood trees such as oaks and hickories, forming dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, white berries that are dispersed by birds, facilitating its spread to new host trees. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, where it derives nutrients from the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical characteristics include a lack of true roots and a reliance on photosynthesis for some of its energy needs.</p>
