                    <h1>Caragana alpina</h1>
<p>Caragana alpina, commonly known as the alpine shrub or goat willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant has small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Caragana alpina is adapted to harsh, alpine conditions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or degraded landscapes.</p>
