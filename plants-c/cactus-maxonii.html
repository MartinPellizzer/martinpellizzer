                    <h1>Cactus maxonii</h1>
<p>Cactus maxonii, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, typical of cacti adapted to desert environments. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Cactus maxonii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates.</p>
