<p>Crenulluma petraea, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in rocky, coastal environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, leaf-like structure with a bright green to yellowish-green upper surface and a darker, often darker green or brown lower surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, with the algae providing photosynthetic energy and the fungi offering structural support and protection. It is often found on limestone or granite surfaces, where it can withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Crenulluma petraea plays a vital role in soil formation and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its ecosystem.</p>
