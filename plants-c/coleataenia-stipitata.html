                    <h1>Coleataenia stipitata</h1>
<p>Coleataenia stipitata, commonly known as the black ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black, velvety leaves and striking, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
