                    <h1>Cephalangraecum glomeratum</h1>
<p>Cephalangraecum glomeratum, commonly known as the clustered star cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular stem with a dense cluster of small, fleshy, cylindrical stems that resemble tiny stars. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, spiny structures, which help minimize water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient choice for xerophytic gardens.</p>
