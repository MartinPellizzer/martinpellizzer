                    <h1>Cirsium setidens var. pinnatifolium</h1>
<p>Cirsium setidens var. pinnatifolium, commonly known as the slender thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features tall, spiny stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, pale green to blue-green leaves with a distinctive pinnatifid (lobed) shape. The plant produces purple to pinkish purple flower heads, which are composed of many small florets arranged in a composite flower structure. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
