                    <h1>Cacao</h1>
<p>Cacao, commonly known as the bean of the cacao tree, is native to the tropical regions of South America and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>The plant produces pods that contain the seeds, which are the source of cocoa mass used in chocolate production. The cacao tree, *Theobroma cacao*, thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are large and elliptical, and the flowers grow directly on the trunk and branches.</p>
<p>The fruit matures over several months, and the beans inside are harvested, fermented, and processed to develop their rich flavor.</p>
