<p>Cassytha major, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true roots and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. The plant's stems are thread-like and can twine around host plants, often forming dense mats. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is commonly found in wetlands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Cassytha major plays a role in ecological systems by influencing the growth of its host plants and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
