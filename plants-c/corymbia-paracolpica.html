                    <h1>Corymbia paracolpica</h1>
<p>Corymbia paracolpica, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin sheets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, white flowers that are clustered in loose cylindrical inflorescences, typically blooming in winter. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to dry environments and is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks.</p>
