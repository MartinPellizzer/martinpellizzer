                            <h1>Cacalia Biafrae</h1>
<p>Biafra cacalia, scientifically known as Cacalia biafrae, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Nigeria. This species belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its delicate, daisy-like blooms. Despite its beauty, Cacalia biafrae remains understudied and is threatened by habitat loss and climate change. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this endemic species for future generations. Its existence highlights the importance of protecting biodiversity in West Africa's fragile ecosystems.</p>
