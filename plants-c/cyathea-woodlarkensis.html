                    <h1>Cyathea woodlarkensis</h1>
<p>Cyathea woodlarkensis, commonly known as the Woodlark cycad, is a unique fern-like plant native to the island of Woodlark in the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is covered in a fibrous, spongy layer, which helps it retain moisture in its humid tropical habitat. Cyathea woodlarkensis is notable for its restricted distribution and is considered a rare species due to habitat loss and limited study.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for conservation and botanical research.</p>
