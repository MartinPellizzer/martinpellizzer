                    <h1>Cypripedium × andrewsii var. favillianum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × andrewsii var. favillianum, commonly known as the favillian lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that aids in pollination by attracting insects. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it forms a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
