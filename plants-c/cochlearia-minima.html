<p>Cochlearia minima, commonly known as the dwarf sea kale, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in coastal areas, particularly on rocky shores and sea cliffs. The plant features small, pale green leaves and produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It is adapted to harsh maritime conditions, with a compact growth form that helps it withstand strong winds and salt spray.</p>
