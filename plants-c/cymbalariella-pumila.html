<p>Cymbalariella pumila, commonly known as the dwarf cymbalariella, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant features delicate, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a slightly silvery appearance. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually white or pale blue, appearing in clusters during the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
