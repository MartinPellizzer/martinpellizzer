<p>Crataegus pilifera, commonly known as the silky hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely hairy leaves, which give it its common name, and its showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus pilifera is often found in moist, open woods and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates.</p>
