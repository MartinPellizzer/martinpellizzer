<p>Colanthelia cingulata, commonly known as the ringed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, bladder-like structures that aid in capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface.</p>
<p>Colanthelia cingulata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
