                    <h1>Calanthe plantaginea var. lushuiensis</h1>
<p>Calanthe plantaginea var. lushuiensis, commonly known as the Lushui calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form compact, low-growing clumps.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and somewhat elusive species in the orchid world.</p>
