                    <h1>Cussonia arenicola</h1>
<p>Cussonia arenicola, commonly known as the sand tussock grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, followed by dry, three-lobed fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates.</p>
