                    <h1>Campanula tarana</h1>
<p>Campanula tarana, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Campanula tarana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment.</p>
