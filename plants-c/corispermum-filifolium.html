<p>Corispermum filifolium, commonly known as the slender sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its seeds are enclosed in small, membranous fruits. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with limited water availability, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Corispermum filifolium is an important component of desert ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
