                    <h1>Coryphopteris ledermannii</h1>
<p>Coryphopteris ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermannâ€™s holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are often adorned with a pale, waxy coating. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
