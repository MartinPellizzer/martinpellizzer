<p>Crocus biflorus subsp.</p>
<p>melantherus, commonly known as the black-flowered crocus, is a rare and striking member of the Iridaceae family. It is characterized by its deep purple to black petals, which contrast sharply with its yellow stamens.</p>
<p>Native to southern Europe, this subspecies thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant produces small, tuberous corms that store nutrients for the next growing season.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after species among horticulturists and botanists.</p>
