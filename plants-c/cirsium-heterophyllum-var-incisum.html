<p>Cirsium heterophyllum var. incisum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a tall, spiny stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with deeply lobed, silvery-green leaves that have a distinctive narrow shape. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spherical shape known as a head. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its prickly foliage, it is considered a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
