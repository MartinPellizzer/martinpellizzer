<p>Cephalocereus albispinus, commonly known as the white-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are covered with white, spiny areoles. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its adaptations include thick, water-storing stems and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its striking appearance and resilience in dry environments.</p>
