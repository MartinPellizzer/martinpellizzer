                    <h1>Castilleja subpurpurascens</h1>
<p>Castilleja subpurpurascens, commonly known as the purplestem Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients through its specialized roots. The plant is characterized by its showy, reddish-orange bract-like flowers that resemble paintbrush strokes. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and shrublands.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health.</p>
