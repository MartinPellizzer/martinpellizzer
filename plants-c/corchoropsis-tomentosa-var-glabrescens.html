                    <h1>Corchoropsis tomentosa var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Corchoropsis tomentosa var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth silky cotton, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, silky leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant produces capsules that contain numerous small, fibrous seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its fibrous seed pods, it has been historically used in traditional textile production.</p>
