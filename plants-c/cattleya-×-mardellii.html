                    <h1>Cattleya × mardellii</h1>
<p>Cattleya × mardellii, commonly known as the Mardell's Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid originating from crosses between Cattleya bowringiana and Cattleya mossiae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from pink to white with a deep red lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light. It produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical climates.</p>
<p>This orchid is prized for its beauty and is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
