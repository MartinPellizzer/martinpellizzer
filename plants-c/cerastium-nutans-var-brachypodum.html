<p>Cerastium nutans var. brachypodum, commonly known as the bent-stem mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features prostrate or ascending stems that are often reddish in color, covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with hairy surfaces and a tendency to curl under the stem.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its shorter, more compact stems compared to the typical form of Cerastium nutans.</p>
