                            <h1>Coristospermum Ferulaceum</h1>
<p>Coristospermum, scientifically known as Coristospermum ferulaceum, is a unique and resilient plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. This hardy shrub is characterized by its thick, woody stems and small, clustered leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. It produces striking yellow or orange flowers that bloom during the rainy season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Despite its ecological importance, Coristospermum ferulaceum remains relatively understudied and is often overlooked in botanical research. Its ability to thrive in extreme conditions makes it a fascinating subject for further scientific exploration.</p>
