                    <h1>Calanthe humblotii</h1>
<p>Calanthe humblotii, commonly known as the Humblot's calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late spring and are adorned with intricate patterns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Calanthe humblotii is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
