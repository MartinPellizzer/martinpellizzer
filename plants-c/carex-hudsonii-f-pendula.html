                    <h1>Carex hudsonii f. pendula</h1>
<p>Carex hudsonii f. pendula, commonly known as the hanging sedge, is a variant of the Hudson's sedge characterized by its drooping inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America, typically found in wet or moist environments such as marshes and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like cluster. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system that aids in its spread and survival in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>The pendulous form of its inflorescence is a distinguishing feature that sets it apart from other Carex species.</p>
