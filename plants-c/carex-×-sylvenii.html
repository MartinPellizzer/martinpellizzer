                    <h1>Carex × sylvenii</h1>
<p>Carex × sylvenii, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. This plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Carex × sylvenii is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in wetland habitats.</p>
