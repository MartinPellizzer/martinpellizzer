<p>Chaetospora nigricans, commonly known as the black-spored liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its simple, thallus-like structure and the presence of specialized structures called gemmae for asexual reproduction. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture efficiently. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, produce the black, spore-bearing capsules that give it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms.</p>
