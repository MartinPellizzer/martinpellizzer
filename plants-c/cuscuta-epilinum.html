                    <h1>Cuscuta epilinum</h1>
<p>Cuscuta epilinum, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like stem that wraps around its host. The plant is widespread in temperate regions and can infest a variety of agricultural and ornamental crops. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, making it an invasive species in many areas.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Cuscuta epilinum plays a role in certain ecosystems by providing food for insects and other small animals.</p>
