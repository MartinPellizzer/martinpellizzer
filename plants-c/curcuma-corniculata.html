                    <h1>Curcuma corniculata</h1>
<p>Curcuma corniculata, commonly known as the horned ginger, is a rhizomatous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. The plant produces striking orange-red flowers that are borne on tall, leafy stems, typically during the rainy season. Its rhizomes, similar to other ginger species, contain bioactive compounds such as curcuminoids, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Curcuma corniculata is also valued in traditional medicine and horticulture for its ornamental value and aromatic qualities.</p>
