                    <h1>Cerastium vulgatum var. glomeratum</h1>
<p>Cerastium vulgatum var. glomeratum, commonly known as clustered mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features prostrate or ascending stems that bear small, hairy leaves arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its clustered flowering habit and its close relation to the genus Cerastium.</p>
