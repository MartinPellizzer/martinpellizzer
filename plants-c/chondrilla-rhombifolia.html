<p>Chondrilla rhombifolia, commonly known as the diamondleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive rhomboid-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it access groundwater. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Chondrilla rhombifolia plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
