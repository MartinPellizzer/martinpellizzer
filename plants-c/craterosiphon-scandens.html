<p>Craterosiphon scandens, commonly known as the climbing green alga, is a species of green algae belonging to the family Ulvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its filamentous growth habit and is typically found in marine environments, particularly on rocky substrates. The plant exhibits a thallus that is often branched and can form dense mats on the ocean floor. It plays a role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to primary productivity and providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
<p>Craterosiphon scandens is also used in scientific research for its potential in biotechnology applications.</p>
