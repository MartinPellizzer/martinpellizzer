                    <h1>Cycas × longipetiolula</h1>
<p>Cycas × longipetiolula, commonly known as the long-petioled cycad, is a hybrid cycad species resulting from the cross between Cycas circinalis and Cycas micronesica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often longer and more slender than those of its parent species. The plant produces cycnophylls, which are the specialized leaf structures that bear the cones, and it exhibits a slow growth rate typical of cycads. It is native to the Pacific Islands and is often found in coastal or lowland areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
