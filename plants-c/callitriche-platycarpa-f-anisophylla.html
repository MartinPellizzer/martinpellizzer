                    <h1>Callitriche platycarpa f. anisophylla</h1>
<p>Callitriche platycarpa f. anisophylla, commonly known as the broad-fruited water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant characterized by its small, floating leaves and delicate, star-shaped flowers.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. The plant exhibits a unique morphological variation in its foliage, with leaves that are broader and more elongated compared to the typical form. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal, with small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds when submerged.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements.</p>
