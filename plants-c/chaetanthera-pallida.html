                    <h1>Chaetanthera pallida</h1>
<p>Chaetanthera pallida, commonly known as the pale chaetanthera, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and dry, open habitats, often found in desert or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The pale flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
