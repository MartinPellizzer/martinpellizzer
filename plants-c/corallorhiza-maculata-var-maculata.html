                    <h1>Corallorhiza maculata var. maculata</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza maculata var. maculata, commonly known as the spotted coralroot, is an orchid that lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is found across much of eastern North America. The plant produces a tall stem with whorled, lance-shaped leaves and is notable for its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system forms a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its reliance on fungal partners, it is considered a keystone species in certain forest ecosystems.</p>
