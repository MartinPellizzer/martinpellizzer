                    <h1>Cufodontia stegomeris</h1>
<p>Cufodontia stegomeris, commonly known as the "skeleton leaf," is a unique fossil plant from the Carboniferous period.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, veinless, and often delicate leaf structures, which resemble the skeletal remains of leaves. The plant is primarily known from its compression fossils, which preserve fine details of its morphology. Its leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a distinctive arrangement that suggests a specialized photosynthetic adaptation.</p>
<p>Cufodontia stegomeris provides important insights into the evolution of early plant structures and paleoenvironmental conditions.</p>
