<p>Cheilanthes marantae var. cupripaleacea, commonly known as the copper-pale leaching fern, is a terrestrial fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and distinctive, lance-shaped fronds with a pale green to copper-colored appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The varietal name "cupripaleacea" refers to the coppery or pale coloration of its foliage, which is a notable botanical feature.</p>
