<p>Corymbia eremaea subsp.</p>
<p>eremaea, commonly known as the Desert bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that often appears flaky or peeling.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The wood is dense and hard, historically used by Indigenous Australians for tools and weapons.</p>
