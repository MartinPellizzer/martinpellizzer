                    <h1>Cocos ventricosa</h1>
<p>Cocos ventricosa, commonly known as the mountain coconut or the giant mountain palm, is a unique species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, fibrous fruits that contain a single, edible kernel. Unlike typical coconut palms, it thrives in cooler, higher-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>
