                    <h1>Cuscuta globulosa</h1>
<p>Cuscuta globulosa, commonly known as the globular dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, round, yellowish-orange seeds that are dispersed by wind, animals, or water. The plant has a vine-like structure with numerous small, thread-like stems that attach to host plants using specialized sucking organs. It is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host, sometimes leading to reduced growth or even death.</p>
