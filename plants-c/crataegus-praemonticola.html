<p>Crataegus praemonticola, commonly known as the coastal hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. The plant has small, ovate leaves with serrated edges and is adapted to coastal climates with salt spray and well-drained soils. It is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
