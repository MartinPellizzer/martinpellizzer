<p>Cyperus pycnocephalus, commonly known as the dense-headed flatsedge, is a member of the sedge family (Cyperaceae).</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are often green or reddish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wet environments.</p>
<p>Cyperus pycnocephalus is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the Americas.</p>
