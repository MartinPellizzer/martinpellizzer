                    <h1>Cephalophyllum loreum</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum loreum, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a unique succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy leaves. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often appearing in late spring. Its leaves are typically bluish-green and have a velvety texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Cephalophyllum loreum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
