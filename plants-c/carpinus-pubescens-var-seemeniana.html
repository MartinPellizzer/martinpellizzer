                    <h1>Carpinus pubescens var. seemeniana</h1>
<p>Carpinus pubescens var. seemeniana, commonly known as the Chinese hornbeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruits are small, woody nuts enclosed in a cupule, typical of the Betulaceae family.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive form and hardy nature.</p>
