                    <h1>Cyclacanthus coccineus</h1>
<p>Cyclacanthus coccineus, commonly known as the red-flowered cycad, is a rare and striking member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the island of Socotra, Yemen, where it thrives in arid and rocky environments. The plant is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Its most notable feature is its vibrant red flowers, which bloom in a dense, spherical inflorescence.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable subject in botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
