<p>Cacotanis ciliata, commonly known as the hairy leaf cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem covered in soft, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Cacotanis ciliata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
