<p>It is a small, shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish in color and are clustered in small groups.</p>
<p>Caroxylon passerinum is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can remain dormant during periods of drought.</p>
