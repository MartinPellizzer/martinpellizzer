                    <h1>Cynoctonum pachyphyllum</h1>
<p>Cynoctonum pachyphyllum, commonly known as the elephant tree, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Despite its hardy nature, it requires well-draining soil and minimal watering to thrive.</p>
