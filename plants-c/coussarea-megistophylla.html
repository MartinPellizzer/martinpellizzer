<p>Coussarea megistophylla, commonly known as the giant flame tree, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are typically large,革质 (leathery), and have a smooth, glossy surface.</p>
<p>Coussarea megistophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates due to its dramatic appearance.</p>
