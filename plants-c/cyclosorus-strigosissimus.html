<p>Cyclosorus strigosissimus, commonly known as the hairy cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in slow-moving or still waters, such as ponds and lakes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus strigosissimus plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
