                    <h1>Centrosema variifolium</h1>
<p>Centrosema variifolium, commonly known as the variable-leaf centrosema, is a tropical legume native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which vary in shape and size, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and it is often used in agroforestry systems due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and agricultural purposes.</p>
