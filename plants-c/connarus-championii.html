                    <h1>Connarus championii</h1>
<p>Connarus championii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a slow-growing, deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark brown bark and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its strength and durability, making it a valuable resource in local economies.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some areas.</p>
