                    <h1>Cactus curassavicus</h1>
<p>Cactus curassavicus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and a dense covering of spines that protect it from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The cactus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
