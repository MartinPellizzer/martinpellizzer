<p>Cerastium vulgatum f. glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving them a slightly sticky texture. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its hairy leaves and clustered flowers make it easily distinguishable from other members of the Caryophyllaceae family.</p>
