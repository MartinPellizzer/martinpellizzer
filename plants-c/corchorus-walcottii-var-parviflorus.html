<p>Corchorus walcottii var. parviflorus, commonly known as the dwarf flowering spurge, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom during the spring and early summer. It is adapted to dry conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
