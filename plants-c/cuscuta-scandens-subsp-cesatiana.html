<p>Cuscuta scandens subsp.</p>
<p>cesatiana, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure that allows it to缠绕 and attach to various host plants.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its thread-like stems and tiny, scale-like leaves that are not photosynthetic. It is often found in agricultural fields and gardens, where it can become a nuisance to crops.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves producing seeds that can remain dormant in the soil for extended periods.</p>
