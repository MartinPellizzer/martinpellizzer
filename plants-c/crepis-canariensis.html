<p>Crepis canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Island hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a single terminal inflorescence, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Crepis canariensis is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and arid environments.</p>
