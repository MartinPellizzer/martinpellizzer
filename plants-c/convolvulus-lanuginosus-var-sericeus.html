<p>Convolvulus lanuginosus var. sericeus, commonly known as silverleaf morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, hairy stems that often sprawl along the ground, and its leaves are ovate with a silvery-gray underside due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink to violet, typically blooming in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread via runners make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed.</p>
