<p>Corynopuntia vilis, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, leafless cactus with cylindrical stems that are often covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. Its structure allows it to conserve water efficiently, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Corynopuntia vilis plays a role in supporting local wildlife by providing food and shelter.</p>
