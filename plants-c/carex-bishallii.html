                    <h1>Carex bishallii</h1>
<p>Carex bishallii, commonly known as the Bishallii sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Carex bishallii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats.</p>
