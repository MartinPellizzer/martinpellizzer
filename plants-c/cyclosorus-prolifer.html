                    <h1>Cyclosorus prolifer</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus prolifer, commonly known as the creeping water fern, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that form a rosette shape, often with four to eight lobes. The plant produces tiny, spore-bearing structures called sporocarps, which are typically found on the underside of its leaves. Cyclosorus prolifer thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it an effective colonizer of wetland habitats.</p>
