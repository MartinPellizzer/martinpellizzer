<p>Ctenopteris subsecundodissecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea holly, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely dissected fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forest undergrowth. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with slender pinnae that are often curved and tapering.</p>
<p>Ctenopteris subsecundodissecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>
