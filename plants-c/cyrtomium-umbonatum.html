                    <h1>Cyrtomium umbonatum</h1>
<p>Cyrtomium umbonatum, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland habitats.</p>
