<p>Cryptospora griffithiana, commonly known as the Himalayan cryptospora, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental change.</p>
