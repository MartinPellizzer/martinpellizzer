<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, three-lobed leaves and spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Cyperus nyikanus is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
