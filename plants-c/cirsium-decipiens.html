                    <h1>Cirsium decipiens</h1>
<p>Cirsium decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads that resemble those of other thistle species. Its flowers are typically arranged in a dense, spherical shape, and the plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Cirsium decipiens is often mistaken for other thistle species due to its similar appearance, hence its common name.</p>
