                    <h1>Crassula lignosa</h1>
<p>Crassula lignosa, commonly known as the African snowball, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months, adding ornamental value. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardens.</p>
