                    <h1>Conocephalus violaceus</h1>
<p>Conocephalus violaceus, commonly known as the violet-tongued batè›¾, is a species of moth belonging to the family Sphingidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet coloration on the proboscis, which is a unique feature among its relatives. The plant is not a botanical species but a common name for the moth, so it does not have botanical aspects in the traditional sense. However, it is often associated with flowering plants that provide nectar for its larvae.</p>
<p>This moth plays a role in pollination and is an important part of the ecological balance in its habitat.</p>
