<p>Caladenia ixioides, commonly known as the yellow spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to south-eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands, often in areas with well-drained soil. The plant produces a single, slender stem that bears a single, showy flower with a yellow dorsal sepal and a hooded labellum. Its flowering period occurs during the late winter to early spring, and it is pollinated by small flies.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and threats from land clearing, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
