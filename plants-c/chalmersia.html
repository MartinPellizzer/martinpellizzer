                    <h1>Chalmersia</h1>
<p>Chalmersia, commonly known as the fairy duster, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico, where they thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Chalmersia species are characterized by their unique, spiky inflorescences that resemble small, glowing candles, hence their common name. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, with bracts that give the plant a striking, almost otherworldly appearance.</p>
<p>They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are adapted to full sun and well-drained soils.</p>
