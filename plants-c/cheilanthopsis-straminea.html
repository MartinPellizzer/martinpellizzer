<p>Cheilanthopsis straminea, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden pubescence. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Cheilanthopsis straminea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
