                    <h1>Calystegia sepium var. maritima</h1>
<p>Calystegia sepium var. maritima, commonly known as sea bindweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a trailing or climbing vine with heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange. The plant thrives in sandy or salty soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. It has a long flowering period, usually from late spring to early autumn, and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Sea bindweed is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
