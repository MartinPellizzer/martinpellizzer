                    <h1>Clermontia epiphytica</h1>
<p>Clermontia epiphytica, commonly known as the HaleakalƒÅ silversword, is a rare endemic plant native to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic shrub, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom once every few years.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat threats, it is classified as endangered.</p>
