<p>Chamaesyce ocellata var. arenicola, commonly known as the sand spurry, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and for stabilizing dunes.</p>
