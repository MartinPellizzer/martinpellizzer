                    <h1>Cyrtostachys loriae</h1>
<p>Cyrtostachys loriae, commonly known as the Loria's spider-orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, spider-like appearance, with long, slender petals and a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cyrtostachys loriae is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
