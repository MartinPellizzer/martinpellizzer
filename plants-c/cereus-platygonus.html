                    <h1>Cereus platygonus</h1>
<p>Cereus platygonus, commonly known as the flat-stemmed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces large, showy flowers that typically bloom at night, a trait common among many cacti. Its spines are short and dense, providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Cereus platygonus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
