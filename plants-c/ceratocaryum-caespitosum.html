<p>Ceratocaryum caespitosum, commonly known as the African grass or umbrella plant, is a perennial grass native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive clump-forming growth habit with upright, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, which are borne on long, slender stalks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental and erosion control purposes.</p>
