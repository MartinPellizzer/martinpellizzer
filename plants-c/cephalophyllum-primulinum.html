                    <h1>Cephalophyllum primulinum</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum primulinum, commonly known as the golden crown cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Cephalophyllum primulinum is often cultivated for its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
