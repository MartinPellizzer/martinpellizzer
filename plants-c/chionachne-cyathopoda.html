<p>Chionachne cyathopoda, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to insulate the plant in cold climates. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Chionachne cyathopoda plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife.</p>
