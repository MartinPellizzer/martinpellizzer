                    <h1>Crotalaria volubilis</h1>
<p>Crotalaria volubilis, commonly known as the climbing crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are often clustered in racemes. It is a vigorous climber, using its twining stems to ascend supports, and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>However, it can be invasive in certain environments, spreading rapidly and potentially outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
