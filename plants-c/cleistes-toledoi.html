                    <h1>Cleistes toledoi</h1>
<p>Cleistes toledoi, commonly known as the Toledan bellflower, is a rare and unusual flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant is notable for its lack of a typical corolla, instead featuring a fused calyx that forms the flower's main structure. It grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cleistes toledoi is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
