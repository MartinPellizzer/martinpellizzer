<p>Colletia ephedra, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Capparaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Colletia ephedra is well adapted to sandy soils and full sun, making it a hardy species in desert ecosystems.</p>
