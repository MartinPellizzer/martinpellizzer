                    <h1>Cylindrokelupha xichouensis</h1>
<p>Cylindrokelupha xichouensis, commonly known as the Xichou mountain cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its robust, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a relict species, offering insights into the evolutionary history of cycads.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
