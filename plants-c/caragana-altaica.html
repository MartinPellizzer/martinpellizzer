                    <h1>Caragana altaica</h1>
<p>Caragana altaica, commonly known as the Siberian peashrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and compound leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in early spring, followed by pods containing edible seeds. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for reclamation of degraded lands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in preventing soil erosion in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
