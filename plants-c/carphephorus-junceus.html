                    <h1>Carphephorus junceus</h1>
<p>Carphephorus junceus, commonly known as the slender flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands.</p>
<p>Carphephorus junceus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
