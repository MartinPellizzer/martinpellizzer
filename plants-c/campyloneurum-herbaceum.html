                    <h1>Campyloneurum herbaceum</h1>
<p>Campyloneurum herbaceum, commonly known as the soft fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 30 cm in length. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of spongy tissue, which helps it absorb nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments and supporting aquatic life.</p>
