                    <h1>Chaetothylopsis micrantha</h1>
<p>Chaetothylopsis micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered chaetothylopsis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories, where it relies on specific humidity and light conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, while its flowers are pale green to white, often mistaken for moss due to their diminutive size.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Chaetothylopsis micrantha is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
