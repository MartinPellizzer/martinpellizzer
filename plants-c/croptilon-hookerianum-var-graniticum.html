                    <h1>Croptilon hookerianum var. graniticum</h1>
<p>Croptilon hookerianum var. graniticum, commonly known as the granitic croptilon, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in rocky, granitic soils.</p>
<p>It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant exhibits a compact growth form with small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pale blue or violet, with five petals and a prominent central stigma, typical of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
