                            <h1>Crataegus Pectinata</h1>
<p>Crataegus pectinata, commonly known as the smooth hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thornless branches, bright green leaves, and clusters of white or pale pink flowers in spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and open areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is a popular choice for landscaping and conservation efforts.</p>
