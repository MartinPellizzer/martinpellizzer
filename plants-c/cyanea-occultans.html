                    <h1>Cyanea occultans</h1>
<p>Cyanea occultans, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. Due to its elusive nature and habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique species from habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
