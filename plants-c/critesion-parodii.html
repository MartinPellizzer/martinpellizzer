                    <h1>Critesion parodii</h1>
<p>Critesion parodii, commonly known as the Parodii's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and its striking, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and relies on specific humidity and light conditions to thrive. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Critesion parodii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
