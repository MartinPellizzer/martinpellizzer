                    <h1>Cardamine pratensis var. lilacina</h1>
<p>Cardamine pratensis var. lilacina, commonly known as the lilac-stemed watercress, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often reddish or lilac-colored stems that grow in wet or marshy habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately divided, and often have a peppery taste.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its unique stem coloration, which sets it apart from the typical green-stemmed Cardamine pratensis.</p>
