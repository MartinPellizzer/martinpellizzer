                    <h1>Cephalomanes javanicum var. sumatranum</h1>
<p>Cephalomanes javanicum var. sumatranum, commonly known as the Sumatran mangrove fern, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to brackish water environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae and is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize coastal soils. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in tidal zones. It plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of mangrove ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental degradation, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
