<p>Crepidium octodentatum, commonly known as the eight-toothed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant's name refers to the eight teeth-like structures on its lateral sepals, which are distinctive features in its floral morphology. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific conditions to bloom successfully.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
