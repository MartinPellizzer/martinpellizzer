                    <h1>Chaetochloa corrugata</h1>
<p>Chaetochloa corrugata, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive zigzag or undulating leaf patterns, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dense mats, forming a low-growing vegetation that thrives in waterlogged or swampy conditions. Its leaves are narrow and have a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in its often saturated habitat.</p>
<p>Chaetochloa corrugata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
