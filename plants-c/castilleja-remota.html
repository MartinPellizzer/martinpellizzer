                    <h1>Castilleja remota</h1>
<p>Castilleja remota, commonly known as the remote stickseed, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves, relying instead on chlorophyll-containing stems for photosynthesis. The plant produces showy, red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in dry, open habitats like grasslands and woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host plants.</p>
