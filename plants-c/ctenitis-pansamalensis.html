                    <h1>Ctenitis pansamalensis</h1>
<p>Ctenitis pansamalensis, commonly known as the Panam√° sea holly, is a rare and endemic fern species found in the coastal regions of Panama.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils near the shoreline, often in areas with high salt exposure. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ctenitis pansamalensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from coastal development and environmental changes.</p>
