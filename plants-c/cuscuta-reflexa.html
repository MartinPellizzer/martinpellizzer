                    <h1>Cuscuta reflexa</h1>
<p>Cuscuta reflexa, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is widespread across temperate regions and can infest a variety of agricultural and wild plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, contributing to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Cuscuta reflexa plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant growth and diversity.</p>
