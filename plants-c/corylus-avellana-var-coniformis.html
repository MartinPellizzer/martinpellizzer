                    <h1>Corylus avellana var. coniformis</h1>
<p>Corylus avellana var. coniformis, commonly known as the European hazel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are hairy when young. The plant produces catkin-like male flowers and female flowers in separate clusters, with the latter developing into hazelnuts. Its conical shape and upright growth habit make it a distinctive ornamental plant.</p>
<p>The nuts are edible and have been used historically for food and crafts.</p>
