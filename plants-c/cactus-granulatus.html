                    <h1>Cactus granulatus</h1>
<p>Cactus granulatus, commonly known as the granulate cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in small, rounded tubercles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores.</p>
<p>Cactus granulatus is well adapted to harsh desert environments, storing water in its succulent stems to survive prolonged dry periods.</p>
