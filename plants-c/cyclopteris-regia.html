                    <h1>Cyclopteris regia</h1>
<p>Cyclopteris regia, commonly known as the royal cyclopteris, is a rare fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, intricate fronds that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant exhibits a unique circinate vernation, where the young fronds coil tightly before unfurling. Its spores are produced in spherical sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Cyclopteris regia is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
