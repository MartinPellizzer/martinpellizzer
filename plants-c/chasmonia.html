                    <h1>Chasmonia</h1>
<p>Chasmonia, commonly known as the "blue poppies," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Papaveraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their showy, often blue or purple, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Chasmonia species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and Mexico. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The flowers are adapted to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to their ecological significance in their native habitats.</p>
