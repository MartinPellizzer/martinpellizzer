                            <h1>Carex Alpina Var. Nigrescens</h1>
<p>Black sedge, scientifically known as Carex alpina var. nigrescens, is a striking plant native to high-altitude environments across the northern hemisphere. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is commonly found in alpine tundra and rocky habitats. Its dark green to almost black foliage gives it a unique and dramatic appearance, making it a standout in its ecosystem. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its resilience and aesthetic value, it is both ecologically significant and a subject of botanical interest.</p>
