<p>Crotalaria filicaulis var. decaulescens, commonly known as the many-stemmed velvetleaf, is a tropical annual herb characterized by its glandular-stemmed structure and alternate, pinnately compound leaves.</p>
<p>It produces distinctive yellow flowers in racemose inflorescences, which are followed by oblong, woody pods containing several elliptical seeds. The plant is native to the Americas and is often found in disturbed soils, such as agricultural fields and roadsides. It is known for its allelopathic properties, which can inhibit the growth of nearby plants.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions where it is introduced.</p>
