                    <h1>Cylindrolobus fimbrilobus</h1>
<p>Cylindrolobus fimbrilobus, commonly known as the slender-lobed cypripedium, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical pseudobulbs and showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, erect flower spike with a complex, three-lobed structure.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several countries.</p>
