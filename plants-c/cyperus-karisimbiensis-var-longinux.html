                    <h1>Cyperus karisimbiensis var. longinux</h1>
<p>Cyperus karisimbiensis var. longinux, commonly known as the Karisimbi sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Virunga Mountains in East Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous grasslands and forest margins. It produces small, clustered flower heads that are wind-pollinated, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
