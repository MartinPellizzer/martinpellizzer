                    <h1>Conostegia tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Conostegia tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender-leafed balsa, is a small evergreen tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles. The plant is well adapted to tropical climates and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is also notable for its lightweight wood, which has been historically used in model building and other crafts.</p>
<p>However, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its limited size and specific growing requirements.</p>
