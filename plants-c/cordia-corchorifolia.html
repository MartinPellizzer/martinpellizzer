<p>Cordia corchorifolia, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, resembling snowballs, hence its common name. These flowers are typically followed by small, round, woody fruits that contain a single seed.</p>
<p>Cordia corchorifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
