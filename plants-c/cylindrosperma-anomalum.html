<p>Cylindrosperma anomalum, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Cylindrosperma anomalum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
