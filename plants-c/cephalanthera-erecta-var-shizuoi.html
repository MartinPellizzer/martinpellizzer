                    <h1>Cephalanthera erecta var. shizuoi</h1>
<p>Cephalanthera erecta var. shizuoi, commonly known as the Shizuoka lady's tresses, is a rare and striking orchid native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and dense clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that resemble a truss of small bells. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
