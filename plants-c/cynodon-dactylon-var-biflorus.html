                    <h1>Cynodon dactylon var. biflorus</h1>
<p>Cynodon dactylon var. biflorus, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in hot, dry climates. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It is widely used for erosion control and as a lawn grass due to its drought tolerance and rapid growth.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous and stolonal growth system allows it to spread aggressively and form a dense sod.</p>
