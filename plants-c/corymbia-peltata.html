                    <h1>Corymbia peltata</h1>
<p>Corymbia peltata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its pale pink to red flowers appear in clusters and are pollinated by birds and insects.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in horticulture for its unique foliage and floral display.</p>
