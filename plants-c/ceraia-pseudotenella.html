                    <h1>Ceraia pseudotenella</h1>
<p>Ceraia pseudotenella, commonly known as the false sand dollar, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the family Tetraodontidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its calcareous, globular shell that resembles a sand dollar, though it is not a true sand dollar. The shell is covered in tiny, radial spines that help in camouflage and protection. This species is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it burrows in sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Its reproductive strategy involves external fertilization, with females laying eggs that are fertilized by the males in the open water.</p>
