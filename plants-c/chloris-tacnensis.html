<p>Chloris tacnensis, commonly known as the Tacna grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in Peru and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Chloris tacnensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils.</p>
