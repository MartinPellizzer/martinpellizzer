                    <h1>Campylotropis reticulinervis</h1>
<p>Campylotropis reticulinervis, commonly known as the net-veined bottlebrush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive bottlebrush-like inflorescences, which consist of dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant has compound leaves with a finely netted venation pattern, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range.</p>
