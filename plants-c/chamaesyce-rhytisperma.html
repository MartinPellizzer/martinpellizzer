                    <h1>Chamaesyce rhytisperma</h1>
<p>Chamaesyce rhytisperma, commonly known as the roughleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by small, dry fruits called achenes.</p>
<p>Chamaesyce rhytisperma is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
