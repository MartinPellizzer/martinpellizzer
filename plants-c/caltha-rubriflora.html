                    <h1>Caltha rubriflora</h1>
<p>Caltha rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in northern regions.</p>
<p>It features striking red-orange flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has a basal rosette of heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that help it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to flourish in marshes and along stream edges.</p>
<p>Caltha rubriflora plays an important ecological role by providing early nectar sources for pollinators.</p>
