                    <h1>Cynanchum ascyrifolium var. calcareum</h1>
<p>Cynanchum ascyrifolium var. calcareum, commonly known as the limestone milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those with a high calcium content, such as limestone soils.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique floral structure, it is an important plant for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
