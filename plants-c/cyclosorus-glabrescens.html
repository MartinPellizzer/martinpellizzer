                    <h1>Cyclosorus glabrescens</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to the freshwater regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, where it attaches itself to submerged rocks or logs. The plant has slender, branching fronds that are covered in a smooth, waxy surface, which helps reduce water resistance. Its spores are released into the water column, allowing for dispersal to new habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
