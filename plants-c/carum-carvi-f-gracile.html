<p>Carum carvi f. gracile, commonly known as slender caraway, is a botanical variant of the caraway plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and smaller, more delicate leaves compared to the standard caraway. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its seeds, like those of common caraway, are used in culinary and medicinal applications.</p>
<p>This form is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in temperate climates.</p>
