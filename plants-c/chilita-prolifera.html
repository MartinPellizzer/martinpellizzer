                    <h1>Chilita prolifera</h1>
<p>Chilita prolifera, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to drought conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive seed heads that resemble dandelion fluff. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
