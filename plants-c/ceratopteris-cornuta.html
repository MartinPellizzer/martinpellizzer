<p>Ceratopteris cornuta, commonly known as the horned water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that bear small, spore-producing structures called sorangia, which are clustered in fleshy, horn-like formations. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Ceratopteris cornuta is often used in scientific research due to its rapid growth and ease of cultivation.</p>
