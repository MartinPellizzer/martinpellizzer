                    <h1>Cynodon americanus</h1>
<p>Cynodon americanus, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial warm-season grass native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and a mat-forming growth habit, which allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has short, rhizomatous stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its deep root system makes it highly drought-tolerant and suitable for low-maintenance lawns and erosion control.</p>
<p>Buffalo grass is also valued for its ability to withstand grazing and its low water requirements.</p>
