                            <h1>Chamaefilix Ruta-Muraria</h1>
<p>Rue, scientifically known as Chamaefilix ruta-muraria, is a perennial herb that has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and herbal remedies. Native to southern Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in gardens and wild landscapes. Its strong, aromatic leaves and small yellow flowers make it a distinctive plant with a long history of cultural and medicinal significance. Despite its beauty, rue is known for its potent and sometimes toxic properties, requiring careful handling. This article explores the characteristics, uses, and importance of this remarkable plant in both historical and modern contexts.</p>
