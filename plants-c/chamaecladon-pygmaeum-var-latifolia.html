                    <h1>Chamaecladon pygmaeum var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Chamaecladon pygmaeum var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved dwarf broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, compact form, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted for efficient water absorption from the dry soil.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
