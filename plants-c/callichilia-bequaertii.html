<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple.

Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain water in its tropical environment.</p>
<p>Callichilia bequaertii is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
