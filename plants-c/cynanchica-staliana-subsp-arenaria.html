<p>Cynanchica staliana subsp.</p>
<p>arenaria, commonly known as the sand dune milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across sandy soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>It plays a vital role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
