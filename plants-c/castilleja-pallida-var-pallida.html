                    <h1>Castilleja pallida var. pallida</h1>
<p>Castilleja pallida var. pallida, commonly known as the pale castilleja, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange-red bracts that resemble petals. The plant lacks true leaves, relying instead on its root system to absorb nutrients from the roots of neighboring host plants. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe.</p>
<p>Castilleja pallida var. pallida plays a role in supporting pollinators and is often found in association with other native flora in its ecosystem.</p>
