                    <h1>Colpodium fibrosum</h1>
<p>Colpodium fibrosum, commonly known as the fibrous bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches, where it can anchor itself to submerged substrates. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, often floating on the water surface or partially submerged.</p>
<p>Colpodium fibrosum is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the digestion of trapped prey for survival.</p>
