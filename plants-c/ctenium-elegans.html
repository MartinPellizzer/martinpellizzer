<p>Ctenium elegans, commonly known as the silky ctenium, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and delicate, feathery leaves that give it a soft, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Ctenium elegans thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its fine foliage and subtle floral display.</p>
