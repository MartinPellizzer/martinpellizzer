                    <h1>Cousinia submutica</h1>
<p>Cousinia submutica, commonly known as the woolly cousin, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which provide insulation and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cousinia submutica is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability.</p>
