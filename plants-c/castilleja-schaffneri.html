<p>Castilleja schaffneri, commonly known as Schaffner's Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that resemble a paintbrush. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for nutrients, often parasitizing grasses and shrubs. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and sagebrush steppe.</p>
<p>Castilleja schaffneri plays an important role in pollination and is a symbol of the diverse flora found in arid regions.</p>
