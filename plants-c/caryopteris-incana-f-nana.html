                    <h1>Caryopteris incana f. nana</h1>
<p>Caryopteris incana f. nana, commonly known as dwarf silver-blue mistflower, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, bluish-gray leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive, almost frosty appearance. The plant produces clusters of delicate, sky-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and the subtle, airy display of its blooms.</p>
