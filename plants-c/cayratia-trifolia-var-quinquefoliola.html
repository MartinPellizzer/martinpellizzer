<p>Cayratia trifolia var. quinquefoliola, commonly known as the five-leafed cayratia, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its stems are slender and twining, allowing it to climb and spread across supports.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid environments and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks.</p>
