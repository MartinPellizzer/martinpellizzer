                    <h1>Chromolaena punctulata</h1>
<p>Chromolaena punctulata, commonly known as the stinging nettle or false nettle, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features opposite, lanceolate leaves with serrated edges and a dense covering of fine, stinging hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open forests.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation and is considered a problematic weed in many regions.</p>
