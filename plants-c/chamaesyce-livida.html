<p>Chamaesyce livida, commonly known as the silverleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects light and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance and help it thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Chamaesyce livida is well adapted to sandy soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
