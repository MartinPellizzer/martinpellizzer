                    <h1>Calotheca niliaca</h1>
<p>Calotheca niliaca, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its crust-like growth form, which adheres tightly to rock surfaces. The thallus of Calotheca niliaca is typically pale to dark green, with a distinctive, often lobed or areolate surface. It is a photobiont-dependent organism, relying on its algal partner for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution.</p>
