<p>Cystopteris japonica, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often found in shallow, freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the water surface. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a finely toothed margin that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Cystopteris japonica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
