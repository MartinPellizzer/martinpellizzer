<p>Centaurea straminea, commonly known as the yellow star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and spiny leaves, which are adapted to thrive in dry, disturbed soils. The plant produces a distinctive seed head that resembles a star, with bracts that are often covered in soft, white hairs. It is an invasive species in many regions outside its native range, posing a threat to native plant communities.</p>
<p>Centaurea straminea is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and other open areas where it can spread rapidly.</p>
