                    <h1>Cyathula capitata</h1>
<p>Cyathula capitata, commonly known as the broad-leafed water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the genus Cyathula. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Cyathula capitata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
