                    <h1>Carex stolonifera var. procera</h1>
<p>Carex stolonifera var. procera, commonly known as the tall sedge, is a perennial plant native to moist, temperate regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces tall, cylindrical spikelets that bear small, clustered flowers, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wet or damp soil and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps, making it a valuable plant for stabilizing soil in wetland environments.</p>
