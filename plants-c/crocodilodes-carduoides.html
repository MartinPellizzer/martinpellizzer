                    <h1>Crocodilodes carduoides</h1>
<p>Crocodilodes carduoides, commonly known as the African burr bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, carduoid (thistle-like) leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces large, woody fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
