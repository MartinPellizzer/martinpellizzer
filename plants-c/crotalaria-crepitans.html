                    <h1>Crotalaria crepitans</h1>
<p>Crotalaria crepitans, commonly known as the "screaming cowpea," is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and palmate leaves, which are divided into three to five lobes. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Crotalaria crepitans is a legume, meaning it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful forage crop and a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
