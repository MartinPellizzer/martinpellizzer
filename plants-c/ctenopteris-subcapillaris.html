                    <h1>Ctenopteris subcapillaris</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris subcapillaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea palm, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in shallow coastal waters, where it thrives in sandy or rocky substrates. Its rhizomes form dense clusters, allowing it to stabilize sediments and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for various small aquatic organisms.</p>
