                    <h1>Cereus spachianus</h1>
<p>Cereus spachianus, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a flowering cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, thick stem and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with a specific species of fungus, which helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
