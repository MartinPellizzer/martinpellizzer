<p>Chlorospatha antioquiensis, commonly known as the Antioquian green fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Antioquia, Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered along the leaf margins. Its growth habit is primarily epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chlorospatha antioquiensis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
