                    <h1>Crataegus rhipidophylla var. browicziana</h1>
<p>Crataegus rhipidophylla var. browicziana, commonly known as the Polish hawthorn, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the hawthorn genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in temperate climates and is typically found in woodland areas or along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
