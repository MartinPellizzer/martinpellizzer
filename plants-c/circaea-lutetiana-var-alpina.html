                    <h1>Circaea lutetiana var. alpina</h1>
<p>Circaea lutetiana var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss in harsh mountain environments. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or grassy slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered an indicator species for high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
