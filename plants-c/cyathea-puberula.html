                    <h1>Cyathea puberula</h1>
<p>Cyathea puberula, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant has a distinctive hairy texture on its young fronds, which gives it its common name. Cyathea puberula thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
