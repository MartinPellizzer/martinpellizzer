                    <h1>Calyptochloa</h1>
<p>Calyptochloa, commonly known as the hooded grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique inflorescence, where the spikelets are enclosed in a sheath-like structure called a calyptra. Calyptochloa species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are narrow and often have a bluish or grayish hue, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>They are important in ecological studies due to their role in soil stabilization and habitat provision for various invertebrates.</p>
