                    <h1>Crepis taraxacifolia var. libyca</h1>
<p>Crepis taraxacifolia var. libyca, commonly known as the Libyan dandelion, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves with a hairy texture adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive, pappus-equipped seeds for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics reflect its evolutionary adaptation to harsh, dry environments.</p>
