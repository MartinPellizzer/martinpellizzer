<p>Coix barbata, commonly known as the hairy bamboo or wild millet, is a member of the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to East Asia and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and distinctive hairy nodes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are encased in a hard, fibrous shell, which can be processed into a nutritious grain.</p>
<p>Coix barbata is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
