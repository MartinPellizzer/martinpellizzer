                    <h1>Cheirostylis boryi</h1>
<p>Cheirostylis boryi, commonly known as the Bory's ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth or on tree trunks. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
