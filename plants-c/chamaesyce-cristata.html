<p>Chamaesyce cristata, commonly known as the crested sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. Its unique leaf shape, often with a wavy or crest-like pattern, gives it a distinctive visual appeal.</p>
<p>Chamaesyce cristata is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping.</p>
