                    <h1>Cordia millenii</h1>
<p>[WRONG START] Codia millenii, commonly known as the African star jelly or the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright yellow or orange fruits. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested, which serves as a natural defense mechanism.</p>
<p>Cordia millenii is often used in traditional medicine and is popular as a houseplant due to its hardiness and unique appearance.</p>
