                    <h1>Castilleja tweedyi</h1>
<p>Castilleja tweedyi, commonly known as Tweedy's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers, typically in clusters, during the spring and early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a sensitive indicator of healthy, undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
