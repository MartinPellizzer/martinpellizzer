                    <h1>Cleistes abdita</h1>
<p>Cleistes abdita, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant with a unique floral structure that features a single, showy, violet-colored flower. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for nutrient absorption, making it highly specialized. Cleistes abdita has a short flowering period, typically in late spring, and is often found growing on decaying wood in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
