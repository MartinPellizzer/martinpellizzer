                    <h1>Cinnamomum erectifolium</h1>
<p>Cinnamomum erectifolium, commonly known as the upright-leaved cinnamon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits containing aromatic seeds. Its leaves and bark contain essential oils, which are used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated compared to other cinnamon species due to its specific climate requirements.</p>
