                    <h1>Cactus leucocentrus</h1>
<p>Cactus leucocentrus, commonly known as the white-tipped cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines that provide insulation and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and appearance make it a distinctive and resilient member of the cactus family.</p>
