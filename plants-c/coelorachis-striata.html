<p>Coelorachis striata, commonly known as the striped bamboo orchid, is a rare and unique member of the orchid family found primarily in the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, striped leaves and slender, bamboo-like stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its growth habit is typically clumping, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Coelorachis striata is considered a delicate and endangered species.</p>
