                    <h1>Calycosia magnifica</h1>
<p>Calycosia magnifica, commonly known as the grand thistle, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its large, showy purple to pink flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a rough, hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Calycosia magnifica thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and rocky slopes.</p>
