                    <h1>Caralluma piaranthoides</h1>
<p>Caralluma piaranthoides, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or violet, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Caralluma piaranthoides is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
