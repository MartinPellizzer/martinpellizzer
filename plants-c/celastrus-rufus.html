                    <h1>Celastrus rufus</h1>
<p>Celastrus rufus, commonly known as red bittersweet, is a deciduous climbing vine native to North America.</p>
<p>It produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are often woody and covered in small, rough hairs. It is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along streams, where it can climb trees or shrubs.</p>
<p>The berries are toxic to humans and animals, making it an important plant to identify in natural areas.</p>
