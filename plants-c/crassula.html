                    <h1>Crassula</h1>
<p>Crassula, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a genus of succulent plants native to Africa, Australia, and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their fleshy, water-storing leaves that help them survive in arid environments. Many species have compact growth habits, often forming rosettes or spreading mats. They produce small, star-shaped flowers in a variety of colors, including pink, red, and white.</p>
<p>Crassula species are popular in rock gardens and as indoor plants due to their low maintenance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
