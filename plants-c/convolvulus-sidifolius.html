                    <h1>Convolvulus sidifolius</h1>
<p>Convolvulus sidifolius, commonly known as the sea convolvulus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has hairy, alternate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its saline environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of the ocean.</p>
<p>Convolvulus sidifolius is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds, making it a resilient species in harsh maritime conditions.</p>
