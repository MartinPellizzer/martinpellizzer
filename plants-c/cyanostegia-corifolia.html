                    <h1>Cyanostegia corifolia</h1>
<p>Cyanostegia corifolia, commonly known as the bluestem cactus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cylindrical stems that are typically blue-green in color, which help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a common adaptation in desert environments to minimize transpiration.</p>
<p>Cyanostegia corifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance.</p>
