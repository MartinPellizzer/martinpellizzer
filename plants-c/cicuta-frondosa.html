                    <h1>Cicuta frondosa</h1>
<p>Cicuta frondosa, commonly known as water hemlock, is a highly toxic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas across North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and fern-like, compound leaves that resemble those of poison ivy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, and its roots contain potent toxins that can be fatal if ingested. Due to its extreme toxicity, it is often referred to as the "deadly weed.".</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is closely related to other members of the genus Cicuta.</p>
