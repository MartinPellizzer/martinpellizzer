                    <h1>Chenopodium × hubertusii</h1>
<p>Chenopodium × hubertusii, commonly known as the hybrid goosefoot, is a species resulting from the cross between Chenopodium album and Chenopodium berlandieri.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it can compete with native vegetation and is sometimes considered a weed.</p>
