<p>Cleistocactus compactus, commonly known as the compact cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem that often branches into a dense, compact form. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically in the evening. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help in reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Cleistocactus compactus is well adapted to harsh desert environments, making it a resilient and hardy plant.</p>
