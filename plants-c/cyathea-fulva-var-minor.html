                    <h1>Cyathea fulva var. minor</h1>
<p>Cyathea fulva var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes produce roots that anchor it to the substrate, while its fronds are responsible for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This variety is smaller than the typical Cyathea fulva, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in moist, shaded conditions.</p>
