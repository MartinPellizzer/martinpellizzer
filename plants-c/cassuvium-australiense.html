                    <h1>Cassuvium australiense</h1>
<p>Cassuvium australiense, commonly known as the Southern Cassuvium, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, pinkish-white inflorescences. The plant typically grows in well-drained sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, which are attracted to its nectar.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Cassuvium australiense is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
