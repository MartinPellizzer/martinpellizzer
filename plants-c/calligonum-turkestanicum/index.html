                            <h1>Calligonum Turkestanicum</h1>
<p>Turkestan spurge, scientifically known as Calligonum turkestanicum, is a resilient shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It thrives in harsh environments with limited water and extreme temperature fluctuations. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and small, often hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, adding a splash of color to the landscape. Due to its hardiness, it plays an important role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife.</p>
