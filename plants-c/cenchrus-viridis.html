                    <h1>Cenchrus viridis</h1>
<p>Cenchrus viridis, commonly known as green panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is both a useful forage plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
