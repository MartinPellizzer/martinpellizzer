<p>Cephalanthera longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, elongated spur at the base of each flower.</p>
<p>This orchid is notable for its lack of showy petals and its reliance on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
