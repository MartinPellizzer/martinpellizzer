<p>Cristaria intonsa, commonly known as the glassy marsh fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It has delicate, feathery fronds that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called soruses, which are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Cristaria intonsa thrives in nutrient-rich, still or slow-moving water environments.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important indicator species for wetland health.</p>
