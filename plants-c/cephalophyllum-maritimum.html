                    <h1>Cephalophyllum maritimum</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum maritimum, commonly known as the sea dudleya, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and reduce transpiration in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring, which are clustered at the end of its stems. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
