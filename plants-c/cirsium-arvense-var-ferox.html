                    <h1>Cirsium arvense var. ferox</h1>
<p>Cirsium arvense var. ferox, commonly known as the creeping thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, hairy leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly and form dense mats, making it difficult to control.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its medicinal properties, though it is generally avoided due to its prickly texture.</p>
