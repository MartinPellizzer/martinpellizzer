                    <h1>Conyza thyrsifera</h1>
<p>Conyza thyrsifera, commonly known as goatweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Africa.</p>
<p>It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and prolific seed production, which allows it to spread easily in disturbed soils. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies, it can become a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
