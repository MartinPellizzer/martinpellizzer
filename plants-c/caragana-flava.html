<p>Caragana flava, commonly known as the yellow shrub locust, is a deciduous shrub native to Central Asia and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow to golden flowers in late spring, which are borne in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds.</p>
<p>Caragana flava is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
