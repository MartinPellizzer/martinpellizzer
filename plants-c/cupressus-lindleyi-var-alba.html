<p>Cupressus lindleyi var. alba, commonly known as the white Mexican cypress, is a rare and ornamental conifer native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its distinctive white to pale blue foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, round cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a landscape specimen.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare species in the wild.</p>
