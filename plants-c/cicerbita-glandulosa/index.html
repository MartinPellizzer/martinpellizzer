                            <h1>Cicerbita Glandulosa</h1>
<p>Glandular cicerbita, scientifically known as Cicerbita glandulosa, is a unique member of the Boraginaceae family. This plant is characterized by its distinctive glandular structures on its leaves and stems. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe, it thrives in rocky and dry habitats. Its striking blue or violet flowers make it a notable sight in alpine environments. Despite its beauty, it remains a relatively rare and understudied species.</p>
