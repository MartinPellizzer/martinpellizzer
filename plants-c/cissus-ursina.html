                    <h1>Cissus ursina</h1>
<p>Cissus ursina, commonly known as the climbing oxalis, is a vigorous, trailing vine native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves with prominent veins, and its stems are covered in tiny, hooked tendrils that aid in climbing. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>Cissus ursina is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
