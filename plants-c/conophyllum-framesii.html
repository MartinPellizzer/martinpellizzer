                    <h1>Conophyllum framesii</h1>
<p>Conophyllum framesii, commonly known as the desert holly, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and sometimes spiny, providing protection against herbivores.</p>
<p>Conophyllum framesii is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
