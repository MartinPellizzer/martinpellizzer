                    <h1>Cuscuta pedunculata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta pedunculata, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems that缠绕 around its hosts. The plant is widespread in temperate regions and can parasitize a variety of crops and wild plants. Its life cycle involves attaching to host plants through haustoria, which penetrate the host's tissues to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
