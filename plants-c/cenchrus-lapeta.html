                    <h1>Cenchrus lapeta</h1>
<p>Cenchrus lapeta, commonly known as the desert grass or narrowleaf sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>Cenchrus lapeta plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
