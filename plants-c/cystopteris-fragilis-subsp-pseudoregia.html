<p>Cystopteris fragilis subsp.</p>
<p>pseudoregia, commonly known as the fragile water fern, is a fern species native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically bipinnate, with finely divided, silky leaves.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides, where it can absorb the necessary moisture for its growth. Its spores are produced in small, clustered clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the wet season.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in its natural habitat.</p>
