                    <h1>Culcita macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Culcita macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its large, umbrella-like compound leaves and showy white flowers.</p>
<p>It is native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia but has been introduced to North America, where it has become an invasive species. The plant can grow up to 5 meters tall, with thick, hairy stems that exude a phototoxic sap when damaged. Its flowers are arranged in complex inflorescences and are pollinated by insects, while its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it a significant ecological concern.</p>
