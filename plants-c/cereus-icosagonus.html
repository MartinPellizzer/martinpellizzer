<p>Cereus icosagonus, commonly known as the 20-sided cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom at night, a feature typical of many desert plants. Its stem is covered in spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stem.</p>
