<p>Cyperus fendlerianus var. debilis, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often obscured by its dense foliage. It is native to the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
