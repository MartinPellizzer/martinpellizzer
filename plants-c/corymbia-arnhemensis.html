<p>Corymbia arnhemensis, commonly known as the Arnhem Land bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that often appears flaky or scaly, and its distinctive blood-red sap, which gives it its common name. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming during the wet season. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture, and it is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Corymbia arnhemensis is valued for its ecological role and has cultural significance to Indigenous communities in the region.</p>
