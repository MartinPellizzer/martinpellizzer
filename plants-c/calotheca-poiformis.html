                    <h1>Calotheca poiformis</h1>
<p>Calotheca poiformis, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for trapping microscopic organisms. These plants are typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. Calotheca poiformis is a submerged or floating plant with simple, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its specialized adaptations for carnivorous feeding and its role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
