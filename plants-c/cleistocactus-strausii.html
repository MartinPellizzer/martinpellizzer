<p>Cleistocactus strausii, commonly known as the "Lace Cactus," is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny, and branched structure, with a compact growth habit. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, a unique feature among cacti. Its stems are covered in short, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Cleistocactus strausii is well adapted to high-altitude conditions and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth.</p>
