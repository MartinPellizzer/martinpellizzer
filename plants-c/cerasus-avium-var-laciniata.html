                    <h1>Cerasus avium var. laciniata</h1>
<p>Cerasus avium var. laciniata, commonly known as the shredded cherry, is a variant of the bird cherry tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, finely serrated leaves that give it a unique, almost feathery appearance. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet cherries in late summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it remains a notable species in botanical gardens and horticultural collections.</p>
