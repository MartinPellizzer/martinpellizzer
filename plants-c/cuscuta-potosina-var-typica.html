                    <h1>Cuscuta potosina var. typica</h1>
<p>Cuscuta potosina var. typica, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thin, thread-like stems that wrap around its host to extract water and nutrients. The plant is native to various regions of the Americas and can be found on a wide range of host species, including agricultural crops. Its rapid growth and ability to infest multiple plants make it a significant agricultural pest.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological interactions and has been studied for its unique biological adaptations.</p>
