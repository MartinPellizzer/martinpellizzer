<p>Chaenactis alpigena, commonly known as the alpine blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are often silvery or grayish due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The species is known for its showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
