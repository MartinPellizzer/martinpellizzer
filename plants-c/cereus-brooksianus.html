<p>Cereus brooksianus, commonly known as the Brooks' candleplant, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its stems are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Cereus brooksianus is a popular choice for xerophytic gardens due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
