                    <h1>Cyperus flavescens subvar. mohrii</h1>
<p>Cyperus flavescens subvar. mohrii, commonly known as the Mohri's flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often pale yellow or brown in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its native environment.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a stabilizing plant in wetland restoration projects.</p>
