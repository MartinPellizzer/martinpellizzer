<p>Cyphokentia robusta, commonly known as the robust cycad, is a species of cycad native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range.</p>
