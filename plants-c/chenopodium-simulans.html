                    <h1>Chenopodium simulans</h1>
<p>Chenopodium simulans, commonly known as desert sandmat, is an annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has a sprawling growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough, sandpaper-like texture. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Chenopodium simulans is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in desert ecosystems.</p>
