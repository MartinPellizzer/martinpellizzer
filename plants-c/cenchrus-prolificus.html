                    <h1>Cenchrus prolificus</h1>
<p>Cenchrus prolificus, commonly known as the desert grass or prolific grass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, fibrous root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. The plant produces dense tufts of narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny spikelets. It is often used for erosion control due to its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it serves as forage for livestock in regions where other vegetation is scarce.</p>
