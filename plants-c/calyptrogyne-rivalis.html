                    <h1>Calyptrogyne rivalis</h1>
<p>Calyptrogyne rivalis, commonly known as the coastal mangrove or mangrove fern, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lygodiaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, including its pinnately compound leaves. The plant exhibits a specialized root system that helps in stabilizing coastal sediments and filtering salt from incoming water. Calyptrogyne rivalis is often found in intertidal zones, where it plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystem dynamics.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures are adapted to dispersal via water, enhancing its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
