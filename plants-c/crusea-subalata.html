                    <h1>Crusea subalata</h1>
<p>Crusea subalata, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects its adaptation to high-altitude environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with rocky or alpine conditions.</p>
