<p>Crucifera alliaria, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and small, white, cross-shaped flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces pods that contain several small, rounded seeds. Garlic mustard is native to Europe but has become an invasive species in North America.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants make it a significant ecological concern.</p>
