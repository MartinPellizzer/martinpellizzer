                    <h1>Cnidoscolus longibracteatus</h1>
<p>Cnidoscolus longibracteatus, commonly known as the giant arrowhead or arrowleaf, is a tropical perennial plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native humid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, spiny fruits that contain several seeds. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in wetland or marshy habitats.</p>
<p>The plant is also notable for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts.</p>
