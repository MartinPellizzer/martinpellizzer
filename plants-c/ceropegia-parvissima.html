<p>Ceropegia parvissima, commonly known as the dwarf string of hearts, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, trailing stems with heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale green, which are pollinated by specific moths.
