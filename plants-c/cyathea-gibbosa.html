                    <h1>Cyathea gibbosa</h1>
<p>Cyathea gibbosa, commonly known as the tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots. The plant has a large, feather-like frond that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea gibbosa reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it plays an important ecological role in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture.</p>
