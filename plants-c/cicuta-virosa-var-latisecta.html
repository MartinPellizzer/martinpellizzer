                    <h1>Cicuta virosa var. latisecta</h1>
<p>Cicuta virosa var. latisecta, commonly known as the broad-leaved water hemlock, is a toxic member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams.</p>
<p>Due to its high toxicity, particularly from the presence of cicutoxin, it is considered a dangerous plant to handle or ingest.</p>
