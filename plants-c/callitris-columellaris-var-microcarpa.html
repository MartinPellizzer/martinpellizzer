<p>Callitris columellaris var. microcarpa, commonly known as the coastal leatherwood, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage composed of scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered around the stems. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its hardiness and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
