                    <h1>Carpodiptera simonis</h1>
<p>Carpodiptera simonis, commonly known as the giant leaf butterfly, is a strikingly colorful insect found in the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nymphalidae and is characterized by its large, intricately patterned wings that resemble broad leaves, providing excellent camouflage. The plant-like appearance of its wings is an evolutionary adaptation for predator avoidance. Its life cycle involves laying eggs on the leaves of specific host plants, such as those in the genus Ficus.</p>
<p>The species plays a role in pollination and serves as an indicator of the health of its tropical forest habitat.</p>
