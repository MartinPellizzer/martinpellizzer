<p>Connarus semidecandrus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark red wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Connarus semidecandrus is now considered an endangered species in its natural habitat.</p>
