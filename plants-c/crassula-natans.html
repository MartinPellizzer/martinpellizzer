                    <h1>Crassula natans</h1>
<p>Crassula natans, commonly known as the floating sedum, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to float on the surface of water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the warmer months. It thrives in wet, sunny conditions and is often found in shallow water bodies like ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to absorb nutrients from water, it is sometimes used in biological water treatment systems.</p>
