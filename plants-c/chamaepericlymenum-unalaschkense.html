<p>Chamaepericlymenum unalaschkense, commonly known as the Alaskan mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with long winters. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine and tundra ecosystems.</p>
