                    <h1>Cypripedium reichenbachianum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium reichenbachianum, commonly known as the Reichenbach's lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or purple in color. The plant features a single upright stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves and is often found in cool, moist forest habitats. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a single flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range.</p>
