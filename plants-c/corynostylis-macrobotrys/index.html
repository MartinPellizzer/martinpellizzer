                            <h1>Corynostylis Macrobotrys</h1>
<p>Corynostylis macrobotrys is a rare and striking plant native to the wetlands of Queensland, Australia. It is known for its large, showy flowers that bloom in late winter and early spring. The plant features a distinctive, erect stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves that give it a unique appearance. Its flowers, which are typically pink or purple, attract a variety of pollinators. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
