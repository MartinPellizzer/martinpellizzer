                    <h1>Chionogentias lilliputiana</h1>
<p>Chionogentias lilliputiana, commonly known as the dwarf snowflake, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a touch of elegance to its rocky habitat. The plant has a low-growing habit, typically reaching only a few inches in height, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silvery fuzz, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
