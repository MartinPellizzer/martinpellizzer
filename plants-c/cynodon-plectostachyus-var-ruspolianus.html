                    <h1>Cynodon plectostachyus var. ruspolianus</h1>
<p>Cynodon plectostachyus var. ruspolianus, commonly known as the African buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, dense sod-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for grazing and erosion control.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments.</p>
