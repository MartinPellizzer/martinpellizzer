                    <h1>Cactus pyramidalis</h1>
<p>Cactus pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its columnar stem, which is typically ribbed and covered in clusters of spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to desert environments.</p>
<p>The cactus also plays a role in supporting local wildlife, providing shelter and food for various insects and small animals.</p>
