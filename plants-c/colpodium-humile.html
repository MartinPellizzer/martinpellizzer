                    <h1>Colpodium humile</h1>
<p>Colpodium humile, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and often clustered at the base, with the bladders attached to the stems.</p>
<p>Colpodium humile plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by serving as both a predator and a food source for other organisms.</p>
