                    <h1>Cheilanthes</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of approximately 150 species of evergreen, drought-tolerant ferns native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their leathery, often sparsely hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. They typically grow on rock surfaces or in crevices, forming dense, low-growing mats. Cheilanthes species are well adapted to harsh environments, with some exhibiting a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>Their spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
