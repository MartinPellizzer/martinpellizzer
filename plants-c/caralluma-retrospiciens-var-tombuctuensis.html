                    <h1>Caralluma retrospiciens var. tombuctuensis</h1>
<p>Caralluma retrospiciens var. tombuctuensis, commonly known as the Tombuctu cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the Sahara Desert.</p>
<p>It features small, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in extreme drought conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season, adding a striking contrast to its green, fleshy structure. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and protect it from herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient example of desert flora.</p>
