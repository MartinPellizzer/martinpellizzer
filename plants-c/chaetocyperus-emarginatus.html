<p>Chaetocyperus emarginatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctively pointed tip, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a dense, cylindrical cluster. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, which are followed by triangular, three-angled seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is often found in disturbed habitats and can be an indicator species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
