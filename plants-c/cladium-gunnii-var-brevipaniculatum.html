                    <h1>Cladium gunnii var. brevipaniculatum</h1>
<p>Cladium gunnii var. brevipaniculatum, commonly known as the dwarf spikerush, is a variant of the spikerush species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter, more densely packed inflorescences compared to the typical variety. The plant thrives in marshy or aquatic habitats, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowering structures consist of spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variant is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to colonize disturbed wetland areas effectively.</p>
