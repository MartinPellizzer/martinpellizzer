                    <h1>Cyclobothra</h1>
<p>Cyclobothra, commonly known as the cyclobothra latisquama, is a unique species of cycad native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, thick, segmented trunk and its large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of gymnosperms. Cyclobothra is adapted to arid environments and has a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
