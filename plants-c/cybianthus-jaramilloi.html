<p>Cybianthus jaramilloi, commonly known as the Jaramillo's lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white petals and a tall, slender stem that supports its elegant blooms. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, Cybianthus jaramilloi is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
