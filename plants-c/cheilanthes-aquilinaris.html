<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocky outcrops and slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soil. The plant has slender, wiry fronds with a delicate, feathery appearance, and its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the leaves.

<p>Cheilanthes aquilinaris is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
