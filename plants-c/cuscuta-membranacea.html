                    <h1>Cuscuta membranacea</h1>
<p>Cuscuta membranacea, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is often found on grasses and other low-growing vegetation, and it can form dense mats on the host's surface. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas easily.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
