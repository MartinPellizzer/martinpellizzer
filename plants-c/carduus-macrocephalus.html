                    <h1>Carduus macrocephalus</h1>
<p>Carduus macrocephalus, commonly known as the large-headed thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, spherical composite flower heads that range in color from pale yellow to deep purple. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into prickly, globular seed heads, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in stiff, bristly hairs, contributing to its defensive structure.</p>
<p>Carduus macrocephalus is often found in dry meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
