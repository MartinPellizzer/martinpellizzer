                    <h1>Chironia minima</h1>
<p>Chironia minima, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various coniferous trees.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or pale green berries that are toxic to humans and animals. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots that penetrate the host tree's tissues. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing tree growth and providing food for certain wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, often leading to the formation of dense clusters on the tree's branches.</p>
