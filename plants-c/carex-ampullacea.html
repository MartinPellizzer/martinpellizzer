<p>Carex ampullacea, commonly known as the bulbous sedge, is a perennial plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces erect, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks.
