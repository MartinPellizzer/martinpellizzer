                    <h1>Cattleya × fowleri</h1>
<p>Cattleya × fowleri, commonly known as the Lady of the Night, is a hybrid orchid prized for its large, showy flowers.</p>
<p>It originates from a cross between Cattleya labiata and Cattleya mossieri, resulting in a plant with robust growth and vibrant, often fragrant blooms. The flowers typically appear in shades of pink, red, and white, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with contrasting patterns. This orchid thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for both indoor cultivation and garden displays due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
