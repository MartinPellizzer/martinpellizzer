                    <h1>Cinchona macrocnemia</h1>
<p>Cinchona macrocnemia, commonly known as the large-leaf quinine tree, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its bark, which contains alkaloids such as quinine, historically used in the treatment of malaria. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its medicinal significance and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
