                    <h1>Cotylaria</h1>
<p>Cotylaria, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic flowering plants.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, often floating leaves and specialized structures called bladders, which are used for capturing small aquatic organisms. Cotylaria species typically grow in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. They are part of the family Lentibulariaceae, which includes other carnivorous plants.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Cotylaria make it unique in its ability to both photosynthesize and obtain nutrients through predation.</p>
