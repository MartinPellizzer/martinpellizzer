                    <h1>Calonemorchis lodgeana</h1>
<p>Calonemorchis lodgeana, commonly known as the Lodge's calonemorchis, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, spurred flowers that are typically a combination of violet and white. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained, rocky soils, often growing on cliffs or among moss-covered stones. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer, and it is adapted to the extreme conditions of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Calonemorchis lodgeana is considered a sensitive species, making it vulnerable to habitat disruption.</p>
