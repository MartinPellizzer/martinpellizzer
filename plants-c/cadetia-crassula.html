<p>Cadetia crassula, commonly known as the Wooly Crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, rounded foliage covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal watering, making it ideal for rock gardens or container cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts.</p>
