                    <h1>Colchicum jankae</h1>
<p>Colchicum jankae, commonly known as the Janka's meadow saffron, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Colchicaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fiery red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a bulbous corm, which serves as its primary storage organ and enables it to survive in harsh alpine conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically appearing after the flowers have bloomed.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Colchicum jankae is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
