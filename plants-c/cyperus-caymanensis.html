<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-sided spikelets that are often clustered at the top of the stem. Cyperus caymanensis is characterized by its ability to form dense stands, which can influence local ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of wetland flora and ecological dynamics.</p>
