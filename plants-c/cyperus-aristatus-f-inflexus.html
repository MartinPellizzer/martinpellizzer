                    <h1>Cyperus aristatus f. inflexus</h1>
<p>Cyperus aristatus f. inflexus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a variant of the common sedge, characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist soils near water bodies. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow or greenish flowers, which are typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is distinguished by its inflorescence structure and leaf morphology, which differ slightly from the typical form of Cyperus aristatus.</p>
