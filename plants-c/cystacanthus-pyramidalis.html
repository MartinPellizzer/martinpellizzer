<p>Cystacanthus pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid-shaped bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its stems are slender and branching.</p>
<p>Cystacanthus pyramidalis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
