<p>Croton pycnocephalus var. argyrocomus, commonly known as the silver-leaf croton, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that display a striking combination of deep green and silvery-white variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright orange or red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for tropical gardens and indoor spaces.</p>
