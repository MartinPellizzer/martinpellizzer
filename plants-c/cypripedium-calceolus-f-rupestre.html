                    <h1>Cypripedium calceolus f. rupestre</h1>
<p>Cypripedium calceolus f. rupestre, commonly known as the alpine lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fragrant, and showy flowers that resemble a cluster of small, pinkish-white petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a dense rosette, and it produces a single spike of flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variety is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
