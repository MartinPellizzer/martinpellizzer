                    <h1>Cuscuta purpurata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta purpurata, commonly known as the purple dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique appearance with thread-like, orange-red stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and can be found on a variety of host species, including grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
