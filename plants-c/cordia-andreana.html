<p>Cordia andreana, commonly known as the red cordia, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces showy, red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Cordia andreana is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and well-drained soils.</p>
