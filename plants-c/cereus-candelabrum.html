                    <h1>Cereus candelabrum</h1>
<p>Cereus candelabrum, commonly known as the candlestick cactus, is a species native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and clusters of white, night-blooming flowers. The plant has a ribbed structure with prominent areoles, from which both spines and flowers emerge. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>The flowers, which open at night, are an important feature for attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths.</p>
