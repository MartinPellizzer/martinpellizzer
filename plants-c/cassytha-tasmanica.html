<p>Cassytha tasmanica, commonly known as the Tasmanian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using slender, thread-like stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to grow in sandy or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
