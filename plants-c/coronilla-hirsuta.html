                    <h1>Coronilla hirsuta</h1>
<p>Coronilla hirsuta, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Coronilla hirsuta is often used in agriculture as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities and its role in improving soil fertility.</p>
