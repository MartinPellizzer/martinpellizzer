                    <h1>Cheilanthes involuta var. obscura</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes involuta var. obscura, commonly known as the obscura lady fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The fronds are pinnately divided, with short, rounded segments that give the plant a dense, compact appearance. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its succulent-like leaves.</p>
<p>This variety is often confused with other members of the Cheilanthes genus but can be distinguished by its darker coloration and unique leaf morphology.</p>
