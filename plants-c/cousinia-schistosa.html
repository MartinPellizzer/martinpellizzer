                    <h1>Cousinia schistosa</h1>
<p>Cousinia schistosa, commonly known as the stonecress or rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are generally blue-gray in color, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Cousinia schistosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
