<p>Copiapoa cinerea var. gigantea, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters, making it one of the largest species in the Copiapoa genus. The plant has a grayish-white coloration due to a dense covering of fine, white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing at the top of the stems during the cooler months.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its striking appearance and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
