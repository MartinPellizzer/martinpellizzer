                    <h1>Cephalocereus nobilis f. cristatus</h1>
<p>Cephalocereus nobilis f. cristatus, commonly known as the cristate organ pipe cactus, is a unique variation of the organ pipe cactus characterized by its flattened, branching growth pattern.</p>
<p>This plant is native to the Sonoran Desert and thrives in arid environments with well-draining soil. Its most striking feature is the formation of "crista," which results from a mutation causing the stems to grow in a fan-like shape. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>It is relatively low maintenance but requires careful watering to avoid root rot.</p>
