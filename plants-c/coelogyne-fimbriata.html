<p>Coelogyne fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, fimbriated (fringed) petals and a distinctive, elongated flower spike. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring, come in shades of white, pink, and red, often with a speckled or mottled pattern.</p>
<p>Coelogyne fimbriata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions.</p>
