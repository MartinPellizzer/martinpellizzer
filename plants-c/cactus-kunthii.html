                    <h1>Cactus kunthii</h1>
<p>Cactus kunthii, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical, spiny stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. Its structure consists of a thick, segmented stem with areoles, from which both spines and flowers emerge.</p>
<p>Cactus kunthii is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
