<p>Cyperus lenticularis, commonly known as the water wheel plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its cylindrical, often ribbed stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters at the base of the stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Cyperus lenticularis is often found in marshes, ponds, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
