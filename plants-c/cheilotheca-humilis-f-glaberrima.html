<p>Cheilotheca humilis f. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous cheilotheca, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers with yellow ray florets and dark brown disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered with fine hairs in the wild form, but this particular form is glabrous, meaning it lacks hair.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and potential ecological adaptations.</p>
