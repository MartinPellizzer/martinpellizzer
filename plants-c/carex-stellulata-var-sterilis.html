                    <h1>Carex stellulata var. sterilis</h1>
<p>Carex stellulata var. sterilis, commonly known as the sterile star sedge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, dark green leaves that form dense, clumping growth. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils, making it a common sight in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce seeds, relying instead on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
