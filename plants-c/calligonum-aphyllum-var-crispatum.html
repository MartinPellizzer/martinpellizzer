                    <h1>Calligonum aphyllum var. crispatum</h1>
<p>Calligonum aphyllum var. crispatum, commonly known as the curly sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to sandy soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize dunes.</p>
