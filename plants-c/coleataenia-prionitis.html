                    <h1>Coleataenia prionitis</h1>
<p>Coleataenia prionitis, commonly known as the purple star orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in the undercanopy of tropical forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Coleataenia prionitis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
