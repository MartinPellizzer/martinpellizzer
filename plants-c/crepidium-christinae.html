                    <h1>Crepidium christinae</h1>
<p>Crepidium christinae, commonly known as the Christina's orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, delicate flower that typically blooms in late spring or early summer. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
