                    <h1>Carex foetida f. pallescens</h1>
<p>Carex foetida f. pallescens, commonly known as the pale sedge, is a variant of the common sedge found in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost bluish-green foliage, which distinguishes it from the typical green coloration of the species. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting various forms of wildlife.</p>
