<p>Cyperus algeriensis, commonly known as Algerian flatsedge, is a flowering plant species belonging to the sedge family, Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to North Africa, particularly Algeria, and thrives in wetland environments such as marshes and along water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
