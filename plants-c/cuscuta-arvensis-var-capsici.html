                    <h1>Cuscuta arvensis var. capsici</h1>
<p>Cuscuta arvensis var. capsici, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow, thread-like stems that twine around its host, often causing damage to agricultural crops. The plant flowers with small, pale yellow or greenish flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity. It is an annual species that thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in fields and gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the yield of crops it infests.</p>
