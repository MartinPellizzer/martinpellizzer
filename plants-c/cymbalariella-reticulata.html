                    <h1>Cymbalariella reticulata</h1>
<p>Cymbalariella reticulata, commonly known as the reticulated lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, web-like thallus structure, which gives it its common name. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive on various substrates such as bark and stone. It is often found in temperate and subarctic regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
