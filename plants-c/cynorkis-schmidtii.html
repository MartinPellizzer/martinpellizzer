                    <h1>Cynorkis schmidtii</h1>
<p>Cynorkis schmidtii, commonly known as the Schmidt's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk with a fibrous, spongy bark and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves. Its reproductive structures include a large, cone-like female strobilus and smaller male cones, typical of cycads.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cynorkis schmidtii is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
