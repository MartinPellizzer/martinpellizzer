                    <h1>Cephalophyllum corniculatum</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum corniculatum, commonly known as the horned cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like stems that are often branched and covered in a layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Cephalophyllum corniculatum is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water once established.</p>
