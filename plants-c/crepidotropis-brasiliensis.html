                    <h1>Crepidotropis brasiliensis</h1>
<p>Crepidotropis brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian false truffle, is a rare and elusive fungus found primarily in the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Crepidotridaceae and is characterized by its small, irregularly shaped, and often deeply embedded fruiting bodies. The species is mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with the roots of certain trees, which helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Its cap is typically pale yellow to ochre, with a fibrous texture, and it often lacks a distinct stem.</p>
<p>Due to its cryptic nature and limited distribution, it is rarely encountered and studied in the wild.</p>
