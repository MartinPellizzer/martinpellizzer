                    <h1>Conophytum cuneatum</h1>
<p>Conophytum cuneatum, commonly known as the "Cape Racer," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rosette-shaped growth pattern with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Conophytum cuneatum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
