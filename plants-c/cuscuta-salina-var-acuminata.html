                    <h1>Cuscuta salina var. acuminata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta salina var. acuminata, commonly known as salt marsh dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is typically found in coastal areas and saline environments, where it attaches to grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, thread-like appearance due to its lack of true stems and leaves. It plays a role in ecological systems by influencing the growth of its host plants and serving as a food source for certain insects.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it is an important indicator species for salt-affected habitats.</p>
