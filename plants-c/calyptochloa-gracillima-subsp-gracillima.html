<p>Calyptochloa gracillima subsp.</p>
<p>gracillima, commonly known as the slender leafed grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive sheath that encloses the stem, giving it its scientific name.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
