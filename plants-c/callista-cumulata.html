                    <h1>Callista cumulata</h1>
<p>Callista cumulata, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a striking epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, intricately divided fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in forest canopies. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its unique reproductive strategy.</p>
