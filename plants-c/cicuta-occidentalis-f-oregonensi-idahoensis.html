                    <h1>Cicuta occidentalis f. oregonensi-idahoensis</h1>
<p>Cicuta occidentalis f. oregonensi-idahoensis, commonly known as the Oregon-Idaho water hemlock, is a variant of the water hemlock species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white, umbrella-shaped flowers. The plant is toxic due to the presence of cicutoxin, a potent neurotoxin that can be lethal to humans and animals. It typically grows in wet, marshy areas and is often found along the edges of ponds, lakes, and streams.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a distinctive yet dangerous plant in its native habitat.</p>
