                    <h1>Capnites caucasicus</h1>
<p>Capnites caucasicus, commonly known as the Caucasian capnoid, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, similar to other members of its family, and it is often found in association with other alpine flora.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Capnites caucasicus is considered a sensitive indicator species of undisturbed mountain ecosystems.</p>
