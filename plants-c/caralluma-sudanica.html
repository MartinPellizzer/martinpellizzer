                    <h1>Caralluma sudanica</h1>
<p>Caralluma sudanica, commonly known as the Sudanese devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Caralluma sudanica is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its efficacy.</p>
