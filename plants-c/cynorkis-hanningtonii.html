                    <h1>Cynorkis hanningtonii</h1>
<p>Cynorkis hanningtonii, commonly known as the Hannington's orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to South Africa, specifically the Eastern Cape province, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems with clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection.</p>
