<p>Carex waponahkikensis, commonly known as the Waponahkikensis sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in wetland ecosystems.</p>
