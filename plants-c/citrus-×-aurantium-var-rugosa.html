                    <h1>Citrus × aurantium var. rugosa</h1>
<p>Citrus × aurantium var. rugosa, commonly known as the rough lemon, is a hybrid citrus plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, rough, and pebbled rind, which distinguishes it from other citrus varieties. The leaves are dark green and oval-shaped, with a slightly serrated margin. The fruit is typically small, yellow when ripe, and has a high acidity level, making it less suitable for fresh consumption but valued in culinary and medicinal applications.</p>
<p>It is often used as a rootstock in citrus cultivation due to its hardiness and disease resistance.</p>
