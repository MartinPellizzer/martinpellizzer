                    <h1>Chenopodium glaucum var. ambiguum</h1>
<p>Chenopodium glaucum var. ambiguum, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and it is known for its ability to spread rapidly through wind-dispersed seeds. Its distinctive, bushy growth habit allows it to form dense stands, often in disturbed or dry soils.</p>
<p>This species is native to North America but has been introduced to other regions, where it can become an invasive weed.</p>
