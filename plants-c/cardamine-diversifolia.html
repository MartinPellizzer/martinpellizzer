<p>It features a rosette of basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a dense inflorescence. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize wet meadows and stream banks.</p>
<p>The leaves and stems are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
