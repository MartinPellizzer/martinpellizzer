                    <h1>Claytonia perfoliata var. depressa</h1>
<p>Claytonia perfoliata var. depressa, commonly known as the "Pigface" or "Cup Plant," is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its foliage. Its unique feature is the way its leaves are fused at the base, forming a cup-like structure that holds rainwater, aiding in the plant's survival.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to full sun conditions.</p>
