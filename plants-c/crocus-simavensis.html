                    <h1>Crocus simavensis</h1>
<p>Crocus simavensis, commonly known as the Simavensis crocus, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, early spring blooming habit, with flowers that typically appear before the leaves. The plant produces showy, violet-blue or white flowers with six petals and a distinctive, three-lobed style. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in rocky, well-drained soils, and it thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
