                    <h1>Cherleria doerfleri</h1>
<p>Cherleria doerfleri, commonly known as the Desert Star, is a striking member of the Aizoaceae family, native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green foliage and vibrant, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, succulent leaves. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, it requires well-drained soil and minimal water to thrive.</p>
