<p>Cinna pendula var. glomerula, commonly known as the clustered cinnamon fern, is a variant of the cinnamon fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, gracefully arching fronds that can reach up to 6 feet in height. The plant features a stout, cinnamon-colored fertile stalk that bears clusters of spore-producing spikes. Its rhizomes grow horizontally, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens.</p>
