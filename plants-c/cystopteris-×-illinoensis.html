                    <h1>Cystopteris × illinoensis</h1>
<p>Cystopteris × illinoensis, commonly known as the Illinois maidenhair fern, is a hybrid fern species that exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Cystopteris bulbosa and Cystopteris fragilis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces spores in small, club-shaped sporangia that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The hybrid nature of Cystopteris × illinoensis contributes to its adaptability and ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
