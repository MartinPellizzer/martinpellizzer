<p>Chenolea dallachyana, commonly known as the Dallachy's chenolea, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Chenolea dallachyana is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
