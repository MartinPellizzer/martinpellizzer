                    <h1>Cheilanthes farinosa var. tenera</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes farinosa var. tenera, commonly known as the soft fringed stone fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and rocky habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and can often be found growing on cliffs, rock faces, or in dry streambeds. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to survive in harsh, low-moisture environments.</p>
