<p>Colchicum multiflorum subsp.</p>
<p>longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>The plant features basal leaves that are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its bulbs are toxic and contain colchicine, a compound used in medicine.</p>
<p>This subspecies is typically found in woodland areas and meadows, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil.</p>
