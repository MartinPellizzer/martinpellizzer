                    <h1>Coffea dewevrei var. sylvatica</h1>
<p>Coffea dewevrei var. sylvatica, commonly known as the forest coffee, is a lesser-known variant of the Coffea genus native to specific regions of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries containing the coffee beans. It thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil, making it suitable for cultivation in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
