                    <h1>Cinchona hasskarliana</h1>
<p>Cinchona hasskarliana, commonly known as the Khasi or Assam cinchona, is a species of the Rubiaceae family native to the northeastern regions of India.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are white or pale pink in color. Its bark contains alkaloids, similar to other cinchona species, which have historically been used in the production of quinine.</p>
<p>However, it is less commercially significant compared to other cinchona varieties.</p>
