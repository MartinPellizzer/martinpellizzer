                    <h1>Cynodon sarmentosus</h1>
<p>Cynodon sarmentosus, commonly known as creeping cynodon, is a perennial grass species native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread rapidly across the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green color, and it is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>It is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
