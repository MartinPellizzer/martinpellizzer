                    <h1>Cynanchum obtusifolium</h1>
<p>Cynanchum obtusifolium, commonly known as blunt-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by follicles containing toxic seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by grazing animals and is considered a potential weed in some areas.</p>
