<p>Ceratostylis formicifera, commonly known as the ant-feeding orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers arranged in a spike, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories.</p>
<p>This orchid is notable for its unique relationship with ants, which inhabit the pseudobulbs and contribute to its survival.</p>
