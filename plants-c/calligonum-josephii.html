The plant produces small, pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable plant for stabilizing coastal and desert landscapes.</p>
<p>Its resilience to drought and extreme temperatures makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
