<p>Claoxylon sandwicense f. tomentosum, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandwicense.</p>
<p>It is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Hawaiian Islands, characterized by its distinctive, palm-like appearance with a single, unbranched trunk. The plant has a dense, fibrous covering on its stem, which gives it a woolly texture, hence the specific epithet "tomentosum.". Its leaves are pinnately compound, with long, narrow leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Hawaii, including high humidity and nutrient-poor soils.</p>
