                    <h1>Castanopsis poilanei</h1>
<p>Castanopsis poilanei, commonly known as the Poulainâ€™s tanoak, is a species of evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China and northern Vietnam.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, woody cupule, a feature typical of the genus Castanopsis. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in subtropical and temperate forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
