                    <h1>Corysanthes speculum</h1>
<p>Corysanthes speculum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly veils, giving it its common name. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
