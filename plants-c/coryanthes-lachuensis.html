                    <h1>Coryanthes lachuensis</h1>
<p>Coryanthes lachuensis, commonly known as the Lachu's coryanthe, is a rare and striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, complex, and often colorful floral structure, which includes a distinctive labellum and spurred column. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, anchoring itself to trees in the canopy where it receives ample light and moisture. Its flowers are pollinated by specific species of beetles, which are attracted by the strong scent and nectar produced by the plant.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Coryanthes lachuensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
