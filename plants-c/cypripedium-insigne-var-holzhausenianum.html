<p>Cypripedium insigne var. holzhausenianum, commonly known as the Holzhausen's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant has thick, fleshy roots and thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
