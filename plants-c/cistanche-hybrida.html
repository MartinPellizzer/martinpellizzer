                    <h1>Cistanche hybrida</h1>
<p>Cistanche hybrida, commonly known as the Chinese parasitic wormwood, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of China.</p>
<p>It is a parasitic species that attaches itself to the roots of host plants, such as the liquorice plant, to derive nutrients. The plant lacks true leaves and stems, instead producing a fleshy, yellowish stem that stores water and nutrients. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in shades of yellow or orange.</p>
<p>Cistanche hybrida is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
