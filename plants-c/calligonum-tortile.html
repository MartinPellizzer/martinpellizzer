                    <h1>Calligonum tortile</h1>
<p>Calligonum tortile, commonly known as the creeping tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with numerous branched stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are scale-like and reduce water loss, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Calligonum tortile is often used for soil stabilization and is valued for its resilience in degraded landscapes.</p>
