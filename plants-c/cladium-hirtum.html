                    <h1>Cladium hirtum</h1>
<p>Cladium hirtum, commonly known as the hairy sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its often soggy habitat. The plant typically grows in shallow water or saturated soil, making it a common sight in marshes and swamps. Its inflorescence consists of small, spadix-like clusters of greenish-white flowers that are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>Cladium hirtum plays an important ecological role by stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
