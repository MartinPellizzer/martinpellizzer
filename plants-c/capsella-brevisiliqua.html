<p>Capsella brevisiliqua, commonly known as the short-stemmed catchfly, is a small annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, also known as the mustard family, and is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10â€“30 centimeters and produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas.</p>
<p>Due to its short life cycle and rapid reproduction, it is considered a common weed in agricultural settings.</p>
