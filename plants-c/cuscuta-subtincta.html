<p>Cuscuta subtincta, commonly known as the redstem dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique appearance with thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and can be found growing on a variety of plants, including grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through contact with the host plant.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation.</p>
