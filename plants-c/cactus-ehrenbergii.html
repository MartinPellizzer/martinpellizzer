                    <h1>Cactus ehrenbergii</h1>
<p>Cactus ehrenbergii, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its shallow root system enables it to absorb moisture quickly from infrequent rains.</p>
<p>Cactus ehrenbergii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
