<p>Corymbia arafurica, commonly known as the Arafura bloodwood, is a species of eucalyptus native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fibrous bark that often peels in thin, flaky layers. The tree produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in loose umbels, which attract various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a leathery texture with a distinctive grey-green hue.</p>
<p>The wood of Corymbia arafurica is hard and dense, historically valued for its durability and use in traditional crafts and construction.</p>
