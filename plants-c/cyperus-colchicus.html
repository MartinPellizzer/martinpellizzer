                    <h1>Cyperus colchicus</h1>
<p>Cyperus colchicus, commonly known as the spiny flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the Americas.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically green or reddish in color. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly, making it an aggressive colonizer in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Cyperus colchicus is adapted to saturated soil conditions and plays a role in stabilizing muddy banks and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
