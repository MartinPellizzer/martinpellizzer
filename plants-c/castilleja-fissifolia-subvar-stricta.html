                    <h1>Castilleja fissifolia subvar. stricta</h1>
<p>Castilleja fissifolia subvar. stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on the roots of other plants for some of its nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to the western United States and is typically found in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers in clusters, which are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it has a fibrous root system that allows it to anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed environments.</p>
