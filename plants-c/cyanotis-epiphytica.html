                    <h1>Cyanotis epiphytica</h1>
<p>Cyanotis epiphytica, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without being parasitic. The plant has small, pale blue or violet flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
