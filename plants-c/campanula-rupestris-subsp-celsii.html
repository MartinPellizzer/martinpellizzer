<p>Campanula rupestris subsp.</p>
<p>celsii, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance.</p>
