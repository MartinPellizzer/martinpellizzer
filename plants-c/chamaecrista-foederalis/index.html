                            <h1>Chamaecrista Foederalis</h1>
<p>Partridge pea, scientifically known as Chamaecrista foederalis, is a native flowering plant found throughout the southeastern United States. This legume is well adapted to sandy soils and full sun, making it a common sight in open fields and along roadsides. Its distinctive yellow flowers, often arranged in clusters, attract a variety of pollinators including bees and butterflies. The plant also plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation. Despite its common presence, the partridge pea remains a valuable and often overlooked component of native plant ecosystems.</p>
