                    <h1>Castanea mollissima</h1>
<p>Castanea mollissima, commonly known as the American chestnut.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves. The tree produces prickly, spiny husks that enclose sweet, edible nuts. It is closely related to the European chestnut and has a long history of use by Indigenous peoples and early settlers.</p>
<p>However, the species has been severely impacted by chestnut blight, leading to its near extinction in the wild.</p>
