                    <h1>Calomeria gracillima</h1>
<p>Calomeria gracillima, commonly known as the slender cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that grow in dense clusters, often forming a shrub-like structure. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically tubular and arranged in clusters. Calomeria gracillima is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and desert landscapes.</p>
