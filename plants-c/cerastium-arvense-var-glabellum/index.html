                            <h1>Cerastium Arvense Var. Glabellum</h1>
<p>Cerastium arvense var. glabellum is a low-growing flowering plant commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is known for its small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit, spreading via stolons to form dense patches. Its leaves are typically ovate and covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. This hardy species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
