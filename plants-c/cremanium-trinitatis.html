                    <h1>Cremanium trinitatis</h1>
<p>Cremanium trinitatis, commonly known as the Trinidadian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Trinidad.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, yellowish berry that ripens in late summer and is sometimes used in local traditional medicine.</p>
