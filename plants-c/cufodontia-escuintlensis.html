<p>Cufodontia escuintlensis, commonly known as the Escuintla fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Cufodontia escuintlensis is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique botanical species.</p>
