                    <h1>Corryocactus ayacuchoensis</h1>
<p>Corryocactus ayacuchoensis, commonly known as the Ayacucho cactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to the Andean region of Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and dense covering of spines, which help it survive in its arid and high-altitude environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise spiny structure. It is adapted to extreme conditions, including high UV exposure and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
