<p>Cicerbita chaffanjonii, commonly known as the Chaffanjon's cicerbita, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers.</p>
<p>Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features slender, branched stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. Its small, white to yellowish flowers appear in clustered umbels, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
