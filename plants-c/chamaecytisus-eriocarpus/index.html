                            <h1>Chamaecytisus Eriocarpus</h1>
<p>Chamaecytisus eriocarpus, commonly known as the sweet smoky bush, is a shrub native to the western coast of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and its fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to coastal environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils with good drainage. Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in coastal regions. Despite its beauty, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
