                    <h1>Citrus halimii</h1>
<p>Citrus halimii, commonly known as the desert citron, is a small evergreen shrub native to arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fruit that is similar in appearance to a lemon but smaller and more oval in shape. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its fruit is edible but not commonly cultivated for commercial use due to its limited size and flavor.</p>
<p>Citrus halimii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging climates.</p>
