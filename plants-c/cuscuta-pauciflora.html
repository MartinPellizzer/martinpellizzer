<p>Cuscuta pauciflora, commonly known as the poorflower dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant's stems are filamentous and twine around host plants to establish a connection for nutrient transfer. It is commonly found in various habitats, including agricultural fields and natural grasslands.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its environment.</p>
