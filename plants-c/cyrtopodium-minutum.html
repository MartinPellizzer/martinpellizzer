                    <h1>Cyrtopodium minutum</h1>
<p>Cyrtopodium minutum, commonly known as the miniature corydalis orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for terrariums and miniature gardening.</p>
