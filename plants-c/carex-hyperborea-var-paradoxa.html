                    <h1>Carex hyperborea var. paradoxa</h1>
<p>Carex hyperborea var. paradoxa, commonly known as the Arctic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, moist environments such as tundra and wet meadows, often growing in dense clusters. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive mats, which help stabilize fragile Arctic soils.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to low light conditions and can tolerate permafrost, making it a key component of Arctic vegetation.</p>
