<p>Coleosanthus glandulosus, commonly known as the hairy ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>

It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
