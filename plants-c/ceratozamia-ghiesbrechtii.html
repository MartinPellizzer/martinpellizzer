                    <h1>Ceratozamia ghiesbrechtii</h1>
<p>Ceratozamia ghiesbrechtii, commonly known as the Ghiesbrecht's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the humid lowland forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a relict species, offering insights into the evolutionary history of cycads.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
