<p>Chondrilla paniculata, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It has adapted to survive in dry environments with deep root systems and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Chondrilla paniculata is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
