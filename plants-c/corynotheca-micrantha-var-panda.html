                    <h1>Corynotheca micrantha var. panda</h1>
<p>Corynotheca micrantha var. panda, commonly known as the panda orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, panda-like markings on its leaves, which feature black and white patterns resembling the fur of the giant panda. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity and well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
