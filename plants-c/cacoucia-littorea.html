                    <h1>Cacoucia littorea</h1>
<p>Cacoucia littorea, commonly known as the coastal bean or sea bean, is a leguminous plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found along shorelines and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
