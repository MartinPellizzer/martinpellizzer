<p>Coutaportla ghiesbreghtiana, commonly known as the Ghiesbreght's coutaportla, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep violet to pale pink. The plant typically grows in well-drained, calcareous soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly serrated margin, and it produces small, seed-bearing capsules after flowering.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
