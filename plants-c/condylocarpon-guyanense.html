                    <h1>Condylocarpon guyanense</h1>
<p>Condylocarpon guyanense, commonly known as the Guyana condylocarpon, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Verrucariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically yellowish to orange in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungal partner from the genus Condylocarpon. It is often found growing on rocky surfaces in humid tropical environments.</p>
<p>This lichen is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and potential applications in biotechnology.</p>
