<p>Cliffortia serpyllifolia var. chamissonis, commonly known as the Chamisson's penny-wort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
