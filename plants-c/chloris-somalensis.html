                    <h1>Chloris somalensis</h1>
<p>Chloris somalensis, commonly known as the Somali grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Horn of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used for erosion control and as a forage plant in livestock grazing areas.</p>
