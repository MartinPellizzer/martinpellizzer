<p>Cristaria calderana, commonly known as the Caldera orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, showy flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Cristaria calderana is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
