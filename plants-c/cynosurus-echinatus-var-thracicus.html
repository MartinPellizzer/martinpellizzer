The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
