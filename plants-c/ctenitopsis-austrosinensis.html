                    <h1>Ctenitopsis austrosinensis</h1>
<p>Ctenitopsis austrosinensis, commonly known as the southern Chinese feather fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a soft, elegant appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
