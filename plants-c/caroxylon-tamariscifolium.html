                    <h1>Caroxylon tamariscifolium</h1>
<p>Caroxylon tamariscifolium, commonly known as the desert shrub or tamarisk-like plant, is a woody species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, an adaptation to its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind or insects. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater.</p>
<p>Caroxylon tamariscifolium plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
