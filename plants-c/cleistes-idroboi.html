<p>Cleistes idroboi, commonly known as the Brazilian bellflower, is a rare and striking orchid native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive hood-like structure. The plant has a compact growth habit and produces few, showy blooms that appear in late spring or early summer. Its flowers emit a sweet, vanilla-like fragrance, which attracts specific pollinators such as moths and bees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cleistes idroboi is considered a conservation concern.</p>
