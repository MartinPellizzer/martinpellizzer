                    <h1>Carpobrotus juritzii</h1>
<p>Carpobrotus juritzii, commonly known as the yellow ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, sprawling stems and thick, waxy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its low-growing habit makes it effective for stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Carpobrotus juritzii is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water once established.</p>
