                            <h1>Coprosma Holmboei</h1>
<p>Coprosma holmboei is a unique species of flowering plant native to the remote island of Samoa. It is known for its striking red and yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. This shrub thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests. Its name comes from the Greek words "kopro" meaning excrement and "smas" meaning to eat, reflecting its historical use in traditional medicine. Despite its beauty, Coprosma holmboei remains a lesser-known plant in the global botanical community.</p>
