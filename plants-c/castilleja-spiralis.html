                    <h1>Castilleja spiralis</h1>
<p>Castilleja spiralis, commonly known as the spiral Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe, often forming dense colonies. Its roots penetrate the roots of neighboring plants, drawing nutrients and water, which is why it is classified as a hemiparasite.</p>
<p>Castilleja spiralis plays an important ecological role by supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystem.</p>
