                            <h1>Callitris Cupressoides</h1>
<p>White cypress, scientifically known as Callitris cupressoides, is a hardy evergreen tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves and cone-shaped fruits, which give it a distinctive appearance. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient choice for landscaping. The tree's aromatic wood has been historically valued for its durability and scent. Its unique features make it both an ecological and ornamental asset in its native habitat.</p>
