<p>Cereus engelmannii var. variegatus, commonly known as the variegated night bloomer, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its segmented stems covered in white, woolly spines and striking, large, white flowers that open at night. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces a short, branched stem with a distinctive variegated pattern.</p>
<p>This species is popular among cactus enthusiasts for its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit.</p>
