<p>Carex praestans, commonly known as the shining sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spikes of small, greenish-white flowers in the summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Carex praestans is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in wet conditions and its aesthetic appeal.</p>
