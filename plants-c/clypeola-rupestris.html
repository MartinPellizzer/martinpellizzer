                    <h1>Clypeola rupestris</h1>
<p>Clypeola rupestris, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Clypeola rupestris thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Its adaptations to harsh, arid conditions make it a resilient and hardy species.</p>
