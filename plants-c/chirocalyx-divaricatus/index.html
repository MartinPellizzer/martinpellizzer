                            <h1>Chirocalyx Divaricatus</h1>
<p>Mexican flame vine, scientifically known as Chirocalyx divaricatus, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. This vigorous climber is prized for its vibrant, tubular flowers that display bold red and orange hues, often resembling flames. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and is commonly used in gardens for its dramatic visual impact. Despite its beauty, it requires careful management due to its rapid growth and potential invasiveness in certain regions. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice among horticulturists and garden enthusiasts.</p>
