                    <h1>Cynodon dactylon var. sarmentosus</h1>
<p>Cynodon dactylon var. sarmentosus, commonly known as African carpet grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread rapidly and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its adaptability and aggressive growth make it both a useful forage crop and a potential weed.</p>
