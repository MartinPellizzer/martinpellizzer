<p>Cistus creticus subsp.</p>
<p>trabutii, commonly known as the Cretan rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in rocky and arid environments. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
<p>The subspecies trabutii is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly different floral characteristics compared to other Cistus species.</p>
