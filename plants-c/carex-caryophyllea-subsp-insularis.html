<p>Carex caryophyllea subsp.</p>
<p>insularis, commonly known as the island sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain island regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in dense, compact clusters, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in isolated habitats, contributing to its name "insularis.".</p>
