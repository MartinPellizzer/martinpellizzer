                    <h1>Cereus acanthurus</h1>
<p>Cereus acanthurus, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a flowering cactus native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features a swollen, brightly colored upper portion called the "pseudostem," which is actually a grafted part of a different species. The lower part of the plant is a rootstock, typically a green or blue-green cactus, which provides the necessary structure and nutrients. The flowers are typically white or pink and appear at the top of the plant during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
