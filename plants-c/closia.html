                    <h1>Closia</h1>
<p>Closia, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. Closia species are often found in woodland or grassland habitats, and they play a role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
<p>However, some species are toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
