<p>Carpogymnia oyamensis, commonly known as the Oyama carpogymnia, is a rare and specialized lichen-forming species belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive thallus structure, which consists of a dense, leathery cortex and a loosely aggregated medulla. The plant exhibits a unique chemical composition, including the presence of specific depsidones and other secondary metabolites. It typically grows on shaded, moist rock surfaces in temperate forest environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
