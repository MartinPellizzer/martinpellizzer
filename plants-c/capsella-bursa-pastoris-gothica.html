                    <h1>Capsella bursa-pastoris gothica</h1>
<p>Capsella bursa-pastoris gothica, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, white flowers with five petals and hairy, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, three-lobed seed pods that burst open to disperse seeds, a characteristic known as explosive dehiscence. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an adaptable and widespread weed in temperate regions.</p>
