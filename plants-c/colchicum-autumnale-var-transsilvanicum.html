                    <h1>Colchicum autumnale var. transsilvanicum</h1>
<p>Colchicum autumnale var. transsilvanicum, commonly known as the Transylvanian autumn crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Carpathian region.</p>
<p>It features striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces a distinctive, helmet-shaped corm that stores nutrients for the next growing season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging after the flowers have faded.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to the common autumn crocus but is distinguished by its geographic distribution and slightly different floral characteristics.</p>
