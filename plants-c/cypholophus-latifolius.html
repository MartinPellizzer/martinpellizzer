<p>Cypholophus latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf cypholophus, is a flowering plant species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and biodiversity.</p>
