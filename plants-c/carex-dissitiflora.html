                    <h1>Carex dissitiflora</h1>
<p>Carex dissitiflora, commonly known as the slender flat-spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, flat spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Carex dissitiflora is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
