                    <h1>Corbularia lobulata</h1>
<p>Corbularia lobulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the water's surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water.</p>
<p>Corbularia lobulata plays an important role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
