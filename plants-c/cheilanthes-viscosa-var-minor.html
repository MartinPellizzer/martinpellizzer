                    <h1>Cheilanthes viscosa var. minor</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes viscosa var. minor, commonly known as the lesser rockcap fern, is a terrestrial fern species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and small, orbicular to ovate fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is often found growing on limestone or sandstone substrates. It is drought-tolerant and possesses a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aids in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>This varietal form is distinguished from the typical *Cheilanthes viscosa* by its smaller size and more densely pubescent fronds.</p>
