<p>Chenopodium rubrum var. humile, commonly known as red sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It has prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The leaves are usually lobed or toothed, with a bluish-gray coloration due to a dense covering of fine hairs. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by dry, three-angled fruits.</p>
<p>This plant is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
