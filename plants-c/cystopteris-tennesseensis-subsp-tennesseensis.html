<p>Cystopteris tennesseensis subsp.</p>
<p>tennesseensis, commonly known as the Tennessee water fern, is a rare fern species native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that often grow in shallow, still water.</p>
<p>The plant has a distinctive morphology with a short, creeping rhizome and small, kidney-shaped sporangia on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in wetlands, streams, and marshes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
