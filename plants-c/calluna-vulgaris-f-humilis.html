                    <h1>Calluna vulgaris f. humilis</h1>
<p>Calluna vulgaris f. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to western Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, compact leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. This variety is characterized by its shorter stature compared to the typical Calluna vulgaris, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions.</p>
