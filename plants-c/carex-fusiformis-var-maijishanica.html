                    <h1>Carex fusiformis var. maijishanica</h1>
<p>Carex fusiformis var. maijishanica, commonly known as the Maijishan sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with a three-parted perianth that facilitates wind pollination.</p>
