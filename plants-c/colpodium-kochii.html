                    <h1>Colpodium kochii</h1>
<p>Colpodium kochii, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in brackish and freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant has thin, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. It typically grows in shallow water, often near the edges of ponds or tidal areas.</p>
<p>Colpodium kochii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by serving as both a predator and a food source for other organisms.</p>
