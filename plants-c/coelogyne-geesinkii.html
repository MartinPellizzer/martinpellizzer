<p>Coelogyne geesinkii, commonly known as the Geesink's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters of up to 20, often in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with limited rainfall. Its leaves are usually broad and革质 (leathery), which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Coelogyne geesinkii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a warm, humid environment.</p>
