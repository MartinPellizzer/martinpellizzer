<p>Castilleja franciscana, commonly known as Franciscan paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to California.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, crimson-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and chaparral.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
