<p>Carpobrotus modestus, commonly known as iceplant, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces vibrant pink or yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its shallow root system helps stabilize sandy soils, making it useful for erosion control.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions.</p>
