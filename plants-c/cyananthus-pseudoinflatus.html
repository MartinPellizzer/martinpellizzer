                    <h1>Cyananthus pseudoinflatus</h1>
<p>Cyananthus pseudoinflatus, commonly known as the inflated bluebell, is a striking member of the Boraginaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its showy, sky-blue flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its slender stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer of hairs, which helps to retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
