<p>Caiophora rosulata subsp.</p>
<p>taraxacoides, commonly known as the clustered caiophora, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
