                    <h1>Cocos × campos-portoana</h1>
<p>Cocos × campos-portoana, commonly known as the hybrid coconut palm, is a naturally occurring hybrid between *Cocos nucifera* and *Euterpe oleracea*.</p>
<p>It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, combining the tall, slender trunk of the coconut palm with the broader leaves of the açaí palm. The plant produces both coconut-like fruits and açaí-like berries, making it unique in its fruit morphology. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal areas with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically cultivated for commercial purposes but is of interest in botanical research.</p>
