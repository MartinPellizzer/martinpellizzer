                    <h1>Cyathostemon verrucosus</h1>
<p>Cyathostemon verrucosus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous annual with slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellow or greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters called cyathia, a characteristic feature of the genus. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Cyathostemon verrucosus is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats.</p>
