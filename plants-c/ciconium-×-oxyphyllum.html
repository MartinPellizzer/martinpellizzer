                    <h1>Ciconium × oxyphyllum</h1>
<p>Ciconium × oxyphyllum, commonly known as the hybrid ciconium, is a rare and ornamental plant resulting from the crossbreeding of two species within the Ciconium genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, strikingly white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
