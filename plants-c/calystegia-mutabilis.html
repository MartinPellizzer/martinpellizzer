                    <h1>Calystegia mutabilis</h1>
<p>Calystegia mutabilis, commonly known as the variable bindweed, is a climbing vine native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to pink or purple. The plant produces berries that transition from green to red as they mature, often persisting on the plant well into winter. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it a challenging weed to control.</p>
