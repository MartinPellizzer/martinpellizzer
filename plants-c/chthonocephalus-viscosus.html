                    <h1>Chthonocephalus viscosus</h1>
<p>Chthonocephalus viscosus, commonly known as the sticky ghostplant, is a rare and elusive plant species belonging to the family Triuridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gelatinous, translucent leaves that give it a ghostly appearance, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is noted for its unique ability to secrete a viscous, sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Chthonocephalus viscosus is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in areas with high humidity and poor soil drainage.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range.</p>
