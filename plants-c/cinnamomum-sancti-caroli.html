                    <h1>Cinnamomum sancti-caroli</h1>
<p>Cinnamomum sancti-caroli, commonly known as the Saint Caroli cinnamon, is a rare and endangered species native to the island of La Réunion in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen tree characterized by its aromatic, dark reddish-brown bark, which is highly valued for its unique scent and flavor. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by oval, dark purple berries containing winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate,革质 (leathery), and have a strong cinnamon aroma when crushed.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
