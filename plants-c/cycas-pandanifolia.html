                    <h1>Cycas pandanifolia</h1>
<p>Cycas pandanifolia, commonly known as the pandan-like cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that resemble the fronds of the pandan plant. The leaves are typically green with a waxy texture and can grow up to several meters in length. This cycad produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Cycas pandanifolia is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
