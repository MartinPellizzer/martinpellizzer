                    <h1>Cordia exaltata</h1>
<p>Cordia exaltata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often reddish bark and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich color, making it important in traditional crafts and construction.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
