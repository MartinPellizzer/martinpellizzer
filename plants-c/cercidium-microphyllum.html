                    <h1>Cercidium microphyllum</h1>
<p>Cercidium microphyllum, commonly known as the desert hackberry, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-resistant.</p>
<p>Cercidium microphyllum plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting desert ecosystems.</p>
