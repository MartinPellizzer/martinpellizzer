                    <h1>Carenophila montana</h1>
<p>Carenophila montana, commonly known as the mountain carenophila, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, Carenophila montana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
