                    <h1>Calonemorchis tentaculata</h1>
<p>Calonemorchis tentaculata, commonly known as the tentacle liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and the presence of specialized structures called rhizoids that anchor it to moist surfaces. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a flattened, ribbon-like body known as a thallus.</p>
<p>Calonemorchis tentaculata plays a role in nutrient cycling in its ecosystem and is often used as an indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
