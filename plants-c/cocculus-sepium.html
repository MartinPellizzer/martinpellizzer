                    <h1>Cocculus sepium</h1>
<p>Cocculus sepium, commonly known as devil's-bit cocklebur, is a perennial vine native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruit capsules that resemble small, inflated burs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges or along streambanks.</p>
<p>The plant has been used historically in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires caution in use.</p>
