                            <h1>Cladium Californicum</h1>
<p>California sawgrass, scientifically known as Cladium californicum, is a unique and resilient plant native to the wetlands of California. This grass-like species thrives in brackish and freshwater marshes, often found in coastal areas along the Pacific coast. With its tall, reed-like stalks and narrow leaves, it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife. Despite its name, it is not a true grass but belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges. Its adaptability to fluctuating water levels makes it an important indicator of wetland health.</p>
