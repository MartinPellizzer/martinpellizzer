<p>Chelonespermum banikiense, commonly known as the Banikiensis Moonflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed species, and is characterized by its striking, night-blooming flowers. The plant produces large, white, trumpet-shaped blooms that emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
