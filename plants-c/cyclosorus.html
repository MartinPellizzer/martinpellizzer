                    <h1>Cyclosorus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus, commonly known as the water clover, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their submerged, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that often form dense mats in freshwater environments. Cyclosorus species are typically found in slow-moving or still waters, such as ponds and lakes, where they can thrive in nutrient-rich conditions. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>However, some species can become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation and altering water chemistry.</p>
