<p>Chaetostoma debile, commonly known as the slender-leaf water plantain, is a species of aquatic plant native to the wetlands and marshes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to its aquatic environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom in the summer months. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the muddy substrates of its habitat.</p>
<p>Chaetostoma debile plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
