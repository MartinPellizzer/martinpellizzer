<p>Cyclosorus superbus, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a complex rhizome system that allows it to spread rapidly in still or slow-moving water. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus superbus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms.</p>
