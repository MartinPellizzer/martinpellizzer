<p>Cakile maritima, commonly known as sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual plant with fleshy, lobed leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea winds and sandy soils. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round pods that contain several seeds. Its root system helps stabilize coastal dunes, making it an important pioneer species in sandy environments.</p>
<p>Cakile maritima is also valued in some cuisines for its peppery, edible leaves.</p>
