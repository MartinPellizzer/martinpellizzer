<p>Carex sylvatica subsp.</p>
<p>latifrons, commonly known as the broad-fruited sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and clustered spikes of small, greenish flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
