                    <h1>Cactus glomeratus</h1>
<p>Cactus glomeratus, commonly known as the clustered cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that are covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise desolate habitat. Its root system is shallow and widespread, allowing it to absorb moisture quickly from brief rainfall events.</p>
<p>Cactus glomeratus plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing shelter and food for various desert animals.</p>
