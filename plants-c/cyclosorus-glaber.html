                    <h1>Cyclosorus glaber</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus glaber, commonly known as the smooth cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizomes for anchoring and nutrient absorption. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus glaber is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to water quality and its role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
