<p>Catabrosa aquatica var. terrestris, commonly known as the aquatic groundsel, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland ecosystems.</p>
