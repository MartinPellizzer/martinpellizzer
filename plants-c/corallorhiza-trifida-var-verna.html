                    <h1>Corallorhiza trifida var. verna</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza trifida var. verna, commonly known as the spring coralroot, is a non-photosynthetic orchid that relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, giving it a pale, often reddish or yellowish appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or greenish in color. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and forest floors.</p>
<p>Due to its reliance on specific fungal partners, it is often found in association with other mycorrhizal plants.</p>
