                            <h1>Cerastium Tetrandrum Var. Zetlandicum</h1>
<p>Zetland's mouse-ear, scientifically known as Cerastium tetrandrum var. zetlandicum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Scottish Highlands. This low-growing species thrives in rocky and grassy habitats, often found in remote and windswept areas. Its small, clustered white flowers appear in late spring, adding a subtle beauty to its rugged environment. Despite its modest appearance, it holds significant ecological value and is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Protecting this unique plant is crucial for preserving the biodiversity of its native habitat.</p>
