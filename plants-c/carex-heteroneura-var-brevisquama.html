<p>Carex heteroneura var. brevisquama, commonly known as the narrow-sheath sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 inch wide, and it produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers in the summer. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, short, narrow bracts.</p>
<p>This sedge is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
