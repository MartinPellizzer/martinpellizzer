<p>Cycas seemannii, commonly known as the Malesian cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate, feather-like leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Cycas seemannii is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
