                    <h1>Carex duthiei var. glacialis</h1>
<p>Carex duthiei var. glacialis, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it survive in cold, rocky environments. The plant typically features narrow, dark green leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy choice for alpine gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical collections.</p>
