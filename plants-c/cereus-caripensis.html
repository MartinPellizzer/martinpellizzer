<p>Cereus caripensis, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a species of cactus native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its segmented, branching stems that bear clusters of vibrant, funnel-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms during the holiday season, producing bright pink, red, or orange flowers. Its leaves are modified into spineless, fleshy structures that help it store water.</p>
<p>Cereus caripensis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
