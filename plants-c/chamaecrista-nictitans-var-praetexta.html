<p>Chamaecrista nictitans var. praetexta, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a leguminous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like, trifoliate leaves and clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant produces elongated, woody pods that contain several elliptical, brown seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
