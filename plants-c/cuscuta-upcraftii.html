                    <h1>Cuscuta upcraftii</h1>
<p>Cuscuta upcraftii, commonly known as the upcreek dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating on the surface of host plants. The plant's stem is covered in tiny, hair-like structures that help it attach to its host. It is native to the western United States and is often found growing on various shrubs and grasses.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
