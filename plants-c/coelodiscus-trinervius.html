<p>Coelodiscus trinervius, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, succulent stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant is also noted for its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation.</p>
