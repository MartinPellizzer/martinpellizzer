<p>Cousinia kotschyi subsp.</p>
<p>khansarica, commonly known as the Khansar cushion plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit, forming compact cushions of foliage that help it conserve water in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs that reduce water loss and provide protection from intense sunlight.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a common sight in mountainous and steppe regions.</p>
