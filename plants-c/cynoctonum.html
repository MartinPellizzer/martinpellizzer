                    <h1>Cynoctonum</h1>
<p>Cynoctonum, commonly known as the nightshade plant, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its typically showy, often colorful flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids like solanine. Cynoctonum is native to various regions in the Americas and thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes rather than for consumption.</p>
