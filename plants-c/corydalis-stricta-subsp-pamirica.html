<p>Corydalis stricta subsp.</p>
<p>pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir Corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple.</p>
<p>The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
