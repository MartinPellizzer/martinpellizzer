<p>Capsella viridis, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a small annual flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops like cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm, with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and small white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters.
