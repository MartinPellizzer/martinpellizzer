                    <h1>Caralluma stalagmifera var. longipetala</h1>
<p>Caralluma stalagmifera var. longipetala, commonly known as the long-petaled rock fig, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick stem with fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that help store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and appetite-suppressing properties.</p>
<p>The variety is distinguished by its elongated petals, which set it apart from other Caralluma species.</p>
