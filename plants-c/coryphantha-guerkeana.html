<p>Coryphantha guerkeana, commonly known as the Guerke's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in spiny areoles, which are typical features of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Coryphantha guerkeana is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to desert climates.</p>
