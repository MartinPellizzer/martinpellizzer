                    <h1>Chionogentias montana</h1>
<p>Chionogentias montana, commonly known as the mountain snowflower, is a rare and delicate alpine plant native to the high elevations of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
