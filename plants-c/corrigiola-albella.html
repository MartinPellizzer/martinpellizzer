<p>Corrigiola albella, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and sandy environments, showcasing its adaptation to harsh maritime conditions. The plant features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often accompanied by succulent, fleshy leaves. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to anchor in loose, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Corrigiola albella plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
