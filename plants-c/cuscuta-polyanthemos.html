                    <h1>Cuscuta polyanthemos</h1>
<p>Cuscuta polyanthemos, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant's stems are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called haustoria, which attach to the host and extract water and nutrients. It is often found growing on crops such as corn and soybeans, making it an agricultural pest.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a challenging weed to control.</p>
