<p>Cleistes, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of only one species, Cleistes gardneri, which is native to the southeastern United States. The plant is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, almost lantern-like appearance. Cleistes has hairy stems and leaves, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits that are capsule-like.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
