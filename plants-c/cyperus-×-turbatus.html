                    <h1>Cyperus × turbatus</h1>
<p>Cyperus × turbatus, commonly known as the tussock flatsedge, is a hybrid grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can dominate wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, impacting native plant communities.</p>
