                    <h1>Calamagrostis groenlandica</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis groenlandica, commonly known as Greenland sedge, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small Arctic animals.</p>
<p>Due to its cold tolerance, it is a key component of the vegetation in high-latitude ecosystems.</p>
