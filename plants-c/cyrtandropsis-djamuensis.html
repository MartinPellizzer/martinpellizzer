                    <h1>Cyrtandropsis djamuensis</h1>
<p>Cyrtandropsis djamuensis, commonly known as the Djamuensis cycad, is a rare and unique plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, palm-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies.</p>
