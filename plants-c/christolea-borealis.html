<p>Christolea borealis, commonly known as the northern Christolea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and thrives in cold, moist environments. Its leaves are evergreen, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, Christolea borealis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
