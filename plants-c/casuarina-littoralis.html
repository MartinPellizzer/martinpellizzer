                    <h1>Casuarina littoralis</h1>
<p>Casuarina littoralis, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a hardy evergreen tree native to coastal regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, needle-like foliage that resembles the appearance of an oak tree. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its small, pale yellow flowers are followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain its seeds.</p>
<p>Casuarina littoralis is well adapted to saline and wind-swept environments, making it a common species in coastal dunes and estuarine areas.</p>
