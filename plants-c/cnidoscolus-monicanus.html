<p>Cnidoscolus monicanus, commonly known as the Mexican stinging leaf or horse bean plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that often have a waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish flowers followed by edible, bean-like fruits that contain a single seed. Its leaves contain irritants such as acrid compounds, which can cause skin irritation upon contact.</p>
<p>Despite its defensive properties, it is cultivated in some regions for its ornamental value and as a source of traditional medicine.</p>
