                    <h1>Cypripedium × marshallianum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × marshallianum, commonly known as the Marshall's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats and has rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its flowers are usually pink or white with a yellow or orange lip, and it blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
