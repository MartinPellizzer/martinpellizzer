                    <h1>Carpiphea</h1>
<p>Carpiphea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and exotic flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, ethereal appearance with pale, translucent petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and they emit a faint, sweet scent to attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature and habitat requirements, Carpiphea is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
