<p>Cereus speciosus var. amecamensis, commonly known as the Amecamense Cereus, is a cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its spines are relatively short and clustered, providing some protection while allowing for air circulation.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
