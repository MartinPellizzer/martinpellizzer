<p>Cheiroglossa austrobrasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian leaf-eared mouse, is a species of rodent native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive leaf-like ear structures, which are a unique adaptation for camouflage. The plant, however, is not a botanical species but an animal, so there are no botanical aspects to describe.</p>
<p>Therefore, I can't reply.</p>
