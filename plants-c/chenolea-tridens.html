<p>Chenolea tridens, commonly known as the three-toothed fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Chenolea tridens plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
