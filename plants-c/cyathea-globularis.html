<p>Cyathea globularis, commonly known as the globe tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, upright trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant's fronds are typically bipinnate, meaning they have a double division, giving them a delicate, lacy appearance. Cyathea globularis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
