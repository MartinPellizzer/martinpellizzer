                    <h1>Cephalanthera longifolia var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Cephalanthera longifolia var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green, grass-like leaves and a tall, spike-like inflorescence bearing numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it relies on fungal associations for its nutrients rather than photosynthesis. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats and blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Cephalanthera longifolia.</p>
