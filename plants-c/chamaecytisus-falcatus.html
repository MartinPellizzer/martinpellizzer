                    <h1>Chamaecytisus falcatus</h1>
<p>Chamaecytisus falcatus, commonly known as the creeping broom or golden broom, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form a dense mat, which helps prevent soil erosion.</p>
