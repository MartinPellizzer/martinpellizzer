<p>Comostemum, commonly known as the false sandwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically small, herbaceous perennials that thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. They are characterized by their succulent leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The leaves are often fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Comostemum species are native to regions of southern Africa, the Mediterranean, and parts of Asia.</p>
