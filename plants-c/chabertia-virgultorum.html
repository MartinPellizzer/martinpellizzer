<p>Chabertia virgultorum, commonly known as the common chabertia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose cluster. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>Chabertia virgultorum is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of wet conditions and its role in supporting local insect populations.</p>
