<p>Corallodiscus forrestii, commonly known as the Forest's corallodiscus, is a rare and unique species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive coral-like inflorescences, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive with indirect sunlight. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Corallodiscus forrestii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
