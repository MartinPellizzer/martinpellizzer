<p>Chrysocoma verticillata, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Chrysocoma verticillata is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
