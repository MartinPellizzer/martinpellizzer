                    <h1>Crocus sativus</h1>
<p>Crocus sativus, commonly known as the saffron crocus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is renowned for its striking purple flowers and is cultivated primarily for its stigmas, which are the source of the spice saffron. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped blooms with three petals and three sepals, typically in the autumn. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, growing from a bulbous underground stem.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical significance lies in its role as one of the most expensive spices in the world due to the labor-intensive harvesting process of its stigmas.</p>
