<p>Cucumis prophetarum subsp.</p>
<p>dissectus, commonly known as the dissected cucumber, is a rare and lesser-known subspecies of the cucumber genus. It is characterized by its finely divided, lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are typically smaller than those of common cucumbers. It is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
