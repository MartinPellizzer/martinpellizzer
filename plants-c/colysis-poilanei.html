                    <h1>Colysis poilanei</h1>
<p>Colysis poilanei, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique pinkish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a delicate, epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Colysis poilanei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
