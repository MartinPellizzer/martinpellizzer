                    <h1>Carex diandra var. ramosa</h1>
<p>Carex diandra var. ramosa, commonly known as the slender marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. It thrives in shallow water or damp environments, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in marshy areas.</p>
