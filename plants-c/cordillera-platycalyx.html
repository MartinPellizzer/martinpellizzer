                    <h1>Cordillera platycalyx</h1>
<p>Cordillera platycalyx, commonly known as the broad-calyx mountain plant, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its robust, shrub-like structure with thick, hairy stems. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Cordillera platycalyx is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils and is an important species in the ecological diversity of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
