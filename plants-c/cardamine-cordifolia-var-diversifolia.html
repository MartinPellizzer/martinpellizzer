                    <h1>Cardamine cordifolia var. diversifolia</h1>
<p>Cardamine cordifolia var. diversifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often heart-shaped and have a distinctive, peppery aroma. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its small, white flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its variability in leaf shape and size, which contributes to its common name "diversifolia," meaning "varied leaves.".</p>
