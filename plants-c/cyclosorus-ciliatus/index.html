                            <h1>Cyclosorus Ciliatus</h1>
<p>Ciliated water fern, scientifically known as Cyclosorus ciliatus, is a rare and ancient aquatic plant belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that resemble small, four-lobed disks. This species is typically found in slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and wetlands, where it thrives in nutrient-rich environments. Its unique feature is the presence of fine cilia along the edges of its leaves, which aid in movement and attachment. Due to its ecological significance and declining populations, the ciliated water fern is a subject of conservation interest and scientific study.</p>
