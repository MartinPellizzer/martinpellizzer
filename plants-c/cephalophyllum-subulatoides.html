<p>Cephalophyllum subulatoides, commonly known as the spiny ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, clustered leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its adaptations make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions, and it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Cephalophyllum subulatoides is a member of the Aizoaceae family, known for its unique floral structures and succulent growth habits.</p>
