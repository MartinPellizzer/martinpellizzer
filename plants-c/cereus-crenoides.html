                    <h1>Cereus crenoides</h1>
<p>Cereus crenoides, commonly known as the star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, a feature typical of many night-blooming cacti. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-water conditions.</p>
