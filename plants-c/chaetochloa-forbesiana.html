<p>Chaetochloa forbesiana, commonly known as the Forbe's hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering stems produce small, spikelet-like inflorescences, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens.</p>
