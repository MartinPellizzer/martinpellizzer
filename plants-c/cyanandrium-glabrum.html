                    <h1>Cyanandrium glabrum</h1>
<p>Cyanandrium glabrum, commonly known as the smooth cyanandrium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyanandrium glabrum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
