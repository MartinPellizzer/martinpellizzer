<p>Cupressus arizonica var. stephensonii, commonly known as the Arizona cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that form dense, dark green foliage, and its bark, which is reddish-brown and peels in thin, flaky layers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that contain seeds, and it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and resilience to harsh conditions.</p>
