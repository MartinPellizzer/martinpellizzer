                    <h1>Clidemia graciliflora</h1>
<p>Clidemia graciliflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It grows on the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological role and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
