<p>Corethamnium, commonly known as the spurge or euphorbia family member, is a genus of flowering plants characterized by their milky sap and often spiny structures.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing their adaptability to harsh conditions. Corethamnium species are herbaceous or shrubby, with simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. They play a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert organisms.</p>
<p>Due to their toxic sap, they are often avoided by herbivores, contributing to their survival in competitive ecosystems.</p>
