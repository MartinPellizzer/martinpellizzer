                    <h1>Cactus ambiguus</h1>
<p>Cactus ambiguus, commonly known as the ambiguous cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>While it is not widely cultivated, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for desert wildlife.</p>
