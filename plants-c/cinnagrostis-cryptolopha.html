                    <h1>Cinnagrostis cryptolopha</h1>
<p>Cinnagrostis cryptolopha, commonly known as the ghost grass, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance with slender, pale green stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant's unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying adaptation to extreme environments. Its flowering period is brief, typically occurring during the cooler months, and it thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Cinnagrostis cryptolopha is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
