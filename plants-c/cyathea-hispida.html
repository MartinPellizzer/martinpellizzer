<p>Cyathea hispida, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a rough, hairy texture on its trunk, which gives it its common name. Cyathea hispida thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
