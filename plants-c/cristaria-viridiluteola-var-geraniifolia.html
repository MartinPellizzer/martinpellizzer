                    <h1>Cristaria viridiluteola var. geraniifolia</h1>
<p>Cristaria viridiluteola var. geraniifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf crista, is a rare and striking plant characterized by its unique foliage.</p>
<p>Its leaves are predominantly silver or gray, with a waxy texture that helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle touch of color to its otherwise muted appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and valuable addition to botanical collections.</p>
