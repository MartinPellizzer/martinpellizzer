<p>Cypripedium × orphanorum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like structure, known as a labellum, which is typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a pseudobulb and produces a single, showy flower per stem, which blooms in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered in its native range.</p>
