                    <h1>Chionochloa spiralis</h1>
<p>Chionochloa spiralis, commonly known as the spiral feather grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass native to the alpine regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to silver in color, which help it blend into its mountainous environment. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is a characteristic species of New Zealand's alpine flora.</p>
