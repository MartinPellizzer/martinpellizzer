<p>Carduus × personatoformis, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads that resemble those of other thistle species. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia. Its hybrid origin suggests it results from crosses between different Carduus species, leading to a mix of morphological traits.</p>
