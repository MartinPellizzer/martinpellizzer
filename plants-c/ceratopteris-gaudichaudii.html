<p>Ceratopteris gaudichaudii, commonly known as the New Caledonian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the island of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>Ceratopteris gaudichaudii plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
