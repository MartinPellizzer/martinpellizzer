<p>Cystopteris douglasii, commonly known as Douglas's water fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while its fronds reach toward the water's surface.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
