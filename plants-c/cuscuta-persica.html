                    <h1>Cuscuta persica</h1>
<p>Cuscuta persica, commonly known as the Persian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to regions of Asia, including parts of China and the Middle East. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants.</p>
