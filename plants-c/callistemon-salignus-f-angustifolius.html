<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery or greyish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces striking red or pink bottlebrush-shaped inflorescences that bloom in spring and summer. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its salt tolerance and drought resistance.</p>
