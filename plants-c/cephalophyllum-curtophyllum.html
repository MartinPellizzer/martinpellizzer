                    <h1>Cephalophyllum curtophyllum</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum curtophyllum, commonly known as the short-leafed cephalophyllum, is a rare and unique member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of northern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of short, woolly spines. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom in late spring and are relatively short in length.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
