                    <h1>Cyperus pedatus</h1>
<p>Cyperus pedatus, commonly known as the swamp arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color, emerging from a short flowering stem. Cyperus pedatus thrives in moist or aquatic conditions, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to colonize wetland areas effectively.</p>
