                    <h1>Carex mirata var. minor</h1>
<p>Carex mirata var. minor, commonly known as the lesser bog sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps that help stabilize the surrounding ecosystem. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
