<p>Cymbopappus hilliardiae, commonly known as the Hilliard's rigid bush, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its dense, often spiny foliage and small, yellowish flowers that appear in winter. The plant has small, pappus-equipped seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across arid and semi-arid regions. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with deep root systems and waxy leaf surfaces.</p>
<p>Cymbopappus hilliardiae is often found in sand dunes and rocky outcrops, contributing to the ecological stability of these environments.</p>
