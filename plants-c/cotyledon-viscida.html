<p>Cotyledon viscida, commonly known as the sticky cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.

Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Cotyledon viscida is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
