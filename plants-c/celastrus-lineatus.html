                    <h1>Celastrus lineatus</h1>
<p>Celastrus lineatus, commonly known as the Indian bittersweet, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright orange to red berries. These berries are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds and animals.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it both useful in landscaping and a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
