                    <h1>Cuscuta planiflora var. ambigua</h1>
<p>Cuscuta planiflora var. ambigua, commonly known as the flatleaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with slender, thread-like stems. The plant is native to various regions in North America and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
