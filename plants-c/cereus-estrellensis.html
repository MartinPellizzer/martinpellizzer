                    <h1>Cereus estrellensis</h1>
<p>Cereus estrellensis, commonly known as the Estrellan night-blooming cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are covered in spines. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to desert environments.</p>
<p>The flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a single night, which adds to its ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
