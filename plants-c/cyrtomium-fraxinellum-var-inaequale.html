                    <h1>Cyrtomium fraxinellum var. inaequale</h1>
<p>Cyrtomium fraxinellum var. inaequale, commonly known as the unequal holly fern, is a variant of the fraxinella holly fern.</p>
<p>It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or rocky areas.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its unique leaf morphology, which distinguishes it from other members of the Cyrtomium genus.</p>
