<p>Caryodendron, commonly known as the tamarind tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a natural dye. The tree produces long, pod-like fruits that contain a sour, pulp-filled seed. The fruit's pulp is widely used in cooking, especially in Indian and Southeast Asian cuisines.</p>
<p>Caryodendron is also valued for its wood, which is durable and used in construction and furniture-making.</p>
