                            <h1>Crataegus Lutea</h1>
<p>Yellow hawthorn, scientifically known as Crataegus lutea, is a small, deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red berries in the fall. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking both beauty and ecological benefits. The yellow hawthorn also plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, providing food and habitat for birds and insects.</p>
