                    <h1>Cheilanthes amoena</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes amoena, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows on rocky outcrops and in crevices, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant has a delicate, creeping rhizome with compact, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered near the margins.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental disturbances, Cheilanthes amoena is considered a rare and protected species in many areas.</p>
