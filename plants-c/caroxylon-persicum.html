                    <h1>Caroxylon persicum</h1>
<p>Caroxylon persicum, commonly known as Persian ironwood, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the mountainous regions of Iran.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard, and extremely durable wood, which has been historically valued for its strength and resistance to decay. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a symbol of longevity in its native habitat. Its leaves are small,革质 (leathery), and its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, producing dark blue or black fruits.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Caroxylon persicum is now critically endangered and protected in many regions.</p>
