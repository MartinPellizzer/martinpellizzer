<p>Chamaesyce garanbiensis, commonly known as the Garanbi sandbur, is a flowering plant native to the grasslands of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces spiny, bristly fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its low-growing habit and adaptive features make it well-suited to its arid environment.</p>
