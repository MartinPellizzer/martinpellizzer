                    <h1>Cuscuta africana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta africana, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to Africa and can be found growing on a variety of host species, including crops like maize and beans. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to spread widely.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
