                    <h1>Cypripedium × paulii</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × paulii, commonly known as the Paul's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Cypripedium × paulii is valued for its ornamental beauty but is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
