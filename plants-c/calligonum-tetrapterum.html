<p>Calligonum tetrapterum, commonly known as the four-winged saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive four-winged fruits, which are adapted for wind dispersal. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well-suited for harsh, saline environments. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in desert and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Calligonum tetrapterum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
