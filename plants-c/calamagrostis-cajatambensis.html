                    <h1>Calamagrostis cajatambensis</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis cajatambensis, commonly known as the Cajatamb√© reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the wetlands of northern South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of rivers, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces dense clusters of spikelets that are often used for ornamental purposes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Calamagrostis cajatambensis is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems.</p>
