                    <h1>Cruciata rugosa</h1>
<p>Cruciata rugosa, commonly known as the rough crasswort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
