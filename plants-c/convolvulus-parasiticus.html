                    <h1>Convolvulus parasiticus</h1>
<p>Convolvulus parasiticus, commonly known as the parasitic bindweed, is a flowering plant that exhibits parasitic behavior, attaching itself to host plants to derive nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its yellow or orange flowers and twining stems. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures for photosynthesis. It primarily infests shrubs and trees, often causing stress to the host by draining its resources.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a weed in many regions.</p>
