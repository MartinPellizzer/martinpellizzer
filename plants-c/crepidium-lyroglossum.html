<p>Crepidium lyroglossum, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, hood-like structure formed by the fusion of the sepals and petals, which protects the flower's reproductive parts. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive labellum that aids in pollination.</p>
<p>Crepidium lyroglossum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems as a food source for certain insects.</p>
