                    <h1>Caragana frutescens var. turfanensis</h1>
<p>Caragana frutescens var. turfanensis, commonly known as the Turfan shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and thorned branches, which help it survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by trifoliate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils, making it suitable for reclamation projects.</p>
<p>This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to prevent soil erosion.</p>
