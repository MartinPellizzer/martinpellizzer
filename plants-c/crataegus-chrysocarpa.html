                    <h1>Crataegus chrysocarpa</h1>
<p>Crataegus chrysocarpa, commonly known as the golden-fruited hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellow to orange berries that are edible but often tart, and they serve as a food source for various birds and mammals. Crataegus chrysocarpa typically grows in moist woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year.</p>
