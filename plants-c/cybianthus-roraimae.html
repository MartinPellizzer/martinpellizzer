                    <h1>Cybianthus roraimae</h1>
<p>Cybianthus roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima sky flower, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the tepuis of Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters at the tips of its slender stems. The plant thrives in the nutrient-poor, acidic soils of the tepuis, where it has adapted to the unique microclimate and high-altitude conditions. Its morphology includes narrow, grass-like leaves and a short, upright stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
