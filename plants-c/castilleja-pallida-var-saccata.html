                    <h1>Castilleja pallida var. saccata</h1>
<p>Castilleja pallida var. saccata, commonly known as the pale castilleja with sac-like structures, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant features showy, red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it often grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The species is part of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many other parasitic and semi-parasitic plants.</p>
