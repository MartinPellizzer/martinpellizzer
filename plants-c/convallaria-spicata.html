                    <h1>Convallaria spicata</h1>
<p>Convallaria spicata, commonly known as the spicate lily-of-the-valley, is a species of flowering plant in the family Convallariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters along slender stems. The plant produces small, dark berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though care must be taken due to its toxic properties.</p>
