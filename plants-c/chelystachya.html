<p>Chelystachya, commonly known as the feather grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their slender, often tufted growth habit and their distinctive, feathery appearance due to their long, narrow leaves. They are typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Chelystachya species are often used in landscaping for their ornamental value and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered, often forming dense inflorescences that add visual interest to the plant.</p>
