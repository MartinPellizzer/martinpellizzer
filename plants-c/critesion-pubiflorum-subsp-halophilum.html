<p>Critesion pubiflorum subsp.</p>
<p>halophilum, commonly known as the salt marsh dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lobed leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers with prominent, hairy sepals, which are adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in estuaries and tidal flats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
