                    <h1>Crocanthemum spartioides</h1>
<p>Crocanthemum spartioides, commonly known as the desert aster, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub with gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>
