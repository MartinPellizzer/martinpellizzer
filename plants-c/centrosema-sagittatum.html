<p>Centrosema sagittatum, commonly known as the arrowhead centrosema, is a perennial legume native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically heart-shaped or arrowhead-like in appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by hairy, pod-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Centrosema sagittatum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects.</p>
