                            <h1>Callista Chrysotoxa</h1>
<p>Golden trumpet, scientifically known as Callista chrysotoxa, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. This vibrant species is prized for its large, showy yellow-orange blooms that resemble small trumpets, hence its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value. The plant's unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice among horticulturists and plant lovers. Despite its beauty, it requires careful attention to soil and water conditions to flourish.</p>
