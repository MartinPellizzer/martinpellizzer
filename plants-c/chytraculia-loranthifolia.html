                <h1>Chytraculia loranthifolia</h1>
<p>Chytraculia loranthifolia, commonly known as the mistletoe of the forest, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature and unique ecological role make it an important species in forest ecosystems.</p>
