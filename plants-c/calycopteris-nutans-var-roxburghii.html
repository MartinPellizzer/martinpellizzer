                    <h1>Calycopteris nutans var. roxburghii</h1>
<p>Calycopteris nutans var. roxburghii, commonly known as the Himalayan panicled grass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across rocky and arid environments. It thrives in high altitudes and is adapted to cold, dry climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its resilience to harsh mountain conditions.</p>
