                    <h1>Castilleja pinnata</h1>
<p>Castilleja pinnata, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, often red or orange flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to parasitize the roots of other plants, drawing nutrients from them. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe.</p>
<p>Its unique ecological role makes it an important species in the study of plant parasitism and ecosystem dynamics.</p>
