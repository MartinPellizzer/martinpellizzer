                    <h1>Cycas dharmrajii</h1>
<p>Cycas dharmrajii, commonly known as the Dharma Raji cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a conservation concern.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN.</p>
