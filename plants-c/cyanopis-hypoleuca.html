<p>Cyanopis hypoleuca, commonly known as the white-veined fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds with a distinctive white vascular pattern visible on the underside. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant in the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Cyanopis hypoleuca plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
