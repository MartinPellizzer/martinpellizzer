                    <h1>Chaetochloa globulifera</h1>
<p>Chaetochloa globulifera, commonly known as the globe sedge, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spherical seed heads that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a dominant species in many freshwater ecosystems.</p>
<p>The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and are often clustered in inflorescences at the base of the plant.</p>
