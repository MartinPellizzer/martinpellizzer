                            <h1>Claytonia Glauca</h1>
<p>Claytonia glauca, commonly known as the blue-eyed Mary, is a delicate flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. The plant is named for its striking blue petals that resemble tiny eyes, adding a touch of beauty to its surroundings. With its low-growing habit and vibrant blooms, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a native, easy-to-care-for plant. Its historical use in traditional medicine also adds to its significance in both ecological and cultural contexts.</p>
