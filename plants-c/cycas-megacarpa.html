                    <h1>Cycas megacarpa</h1>
<p>Cycas megacarpa, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a unique plant native to the eastern coast of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, making it a dioecious species. Cycas megacarpa is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
