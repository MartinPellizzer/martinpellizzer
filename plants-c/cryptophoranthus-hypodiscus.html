                    <h1>Cryptophoranthus hypodiscus</h1>
<p>Cryptophoranthus hypodiscus, commonly known as the giant rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a valuable species for ecological studies in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
