                    <h1>Crudia blancoi</h1>
<p>Crudia blancoi, commonly known as the Blanco's crinum, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, strap-like leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in the summer months, producing clusters of white or pale pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments.</p>
