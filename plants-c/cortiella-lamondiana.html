                    <h1>Cortiella lamondiana</h1>
<p>Cortiella lamondiana, commonly known as the Lamond's cortiella, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Teloschistaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, encrusting layer on rock surfaces, typically in shaded, humid environments. The thallus is pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinct, granular texture. It contains the secondary metabolite atranorin, which contributes to its chemical profile and ecological interactions.</p>
<p>This lichen is often found in temperate regions and is used in ecological studies to assess air quality and biodiversity.</p>
