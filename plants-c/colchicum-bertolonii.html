                <h1>Colchicum bertolonii</h1>
<p>Colchicum bertolonii, commonly known as the Bertoloni's colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Colchicaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a bulbous corm, which serves as its storage organ and allows it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are basal, broad, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically violet or purple in color, with a distinctive spurred petal that aids in pollination by insects.</p>
