                    <h1>Castilleja parvula var. revealii</h1>
<p>Castilleja parvula var. revealii, commonly known as the smallleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures, relying on host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and parasitic nature make it an interesting subject in ecological studies.</p>
