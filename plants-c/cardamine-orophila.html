<p>Cardamine orophila, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a small perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Cardamine orophila is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its aesthetic appeal in alpine gardens.</p>
