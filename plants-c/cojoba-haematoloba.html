<p>Cojoba haematoloba, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and beauty. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Cojoba haematoloba is now listed as an endangered species in many regions.</p>
