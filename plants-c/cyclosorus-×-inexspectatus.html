                    <h1>Cyclosorus × inexspectatus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus × inexspectatus, commonly known as the hybrid water shield, is a rare aquatic plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Cyclosorus australis and Cyclosorus sphaericus.</p>
<p>It is typically found in shallow, still waters with muddy substrates, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are rounded at the base and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters, and it relies on wind for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
