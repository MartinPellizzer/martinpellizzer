                    <h1>Cuscuta planiflora var. tendae</h1>
<p>Cuscuta planiflora var. tendae, commonly known as the flatleaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that缠绕 around its host. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is often found parasitizing various species of grasses and shrubs. Its life cycle involves germinating seeds, attaching to a host with specialized structures called haustoria, and then growing and reproducing.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation.</p>
