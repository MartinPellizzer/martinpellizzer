                    <h1>Couthovia novocaledonica</h1>
<p>Couthovia novocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia couthovia, is an endemic plant species found exclusively in the tropical rainforests of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and waxy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically growing on rocky substrates or in dense undergrowth. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying island endemism.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
