<p>Ceraria kaokoensis, commonly known as the Kaoko ceraria, is a flowering plant native to the hyperarid regions of Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom during the brief rainy season. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to extreme temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
