<p>Carex firma, commonly known as hardstem sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered spikes of brownish or reddish flowers in the summer, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Carex firma is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife in wetland ecosystems.</p>
