                    <h1>Carex petricosa var. distichiflora</h1>
<p>Carex petricosa var. distichiflora, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spikes of small, greenish-brown flowers in the summer. The plant typically grows in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny environments.</p>
