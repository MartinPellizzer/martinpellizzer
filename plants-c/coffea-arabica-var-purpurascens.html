                    <h1>Coffea arabica var. purpurascens</h1>
<p>Coffea arabica var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple coffee plant, is a rare variant of the arabica coffee species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive deep purple leaves, which set it apart from the typical green foliage of standard arabica plants. This variety is native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia, where it thrives in cool, shaded environments. The flowers are small and white, and the fruit, when ripe, turns a striking red color.</p>
<p>Although it produces coffee cherries, it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than commercial coffee production.</p>
