<p>Chupalon bracteatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a problematic weed in agricultural settings.</p>
