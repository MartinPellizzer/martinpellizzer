<p>Cleistocactus aureus, commonly known as the golden cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, columnar cactus with a distinctive golden-yellow coloration due to its dense covering of fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that open at night, a characteristic feature of its nocturnal blooming habit. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Cleistocactus aureus is also noted for its slow growth rate and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid gardens.</p>
