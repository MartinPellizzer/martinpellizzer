                    <h1>Carex × mithala</h1>
<p>Carex × mithala, commonly known as the hybrid sedges, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and triangular stems.</p>
<p>This plant is a natural hybrid between Carex lyngbyei and Carex morrowii, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, facilitating wind pollination.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to its ecological significance in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms.</p>
