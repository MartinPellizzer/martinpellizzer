<p>Coeloglossum albidum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, ghostly appearance, with long, slender leaves and a single, showy white flower. The plant thrives in wet, shaded environments such as swamps and pine flatwoods, often growing on the trunks of trees. It has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered an endangered species.</p>
