<p>Crepidium parryae, commonly known as the Parry's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces a single, slender stem with a few leaves and bears a single, fragrant flower with a distinctive, spurred lip. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Crepidium parryae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
