                    <h1>Cuscuta stylosa</h1>
<p>Cuscuta stylosa, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves attaching to host plants via haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant is often found growing on a variety of herbaceous hosts, including grasses and legumes. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through the movement of the host plant.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth and health of its host.</p>
