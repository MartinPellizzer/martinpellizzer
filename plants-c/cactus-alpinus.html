                    <h1>Cactus alpinus</h1>
<p>Cactus alpinus, commonly known as the alpine cactus, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, spiny stems that are adapted to store water and withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Cactus alpinus thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a resilient plant in arid and mountainous climates.</p>
