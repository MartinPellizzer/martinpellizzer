<p>Conophytum rescriptum, commonly known as the "Bulbous Stonecrop," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, bulb-like stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Conophytum rescriptum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
