                    <h1>Cereus thalassinus var. quadrangularis</h1>
<p>Cereus thalassinus var. quadrangularis, commonly known as the angular moon cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the dry regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are often angular in shape, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking white flowers that bloom at night, a trait typical of many nocturnal cacti. Its stems are covered in small, spiny tubercles, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its distinctive appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
