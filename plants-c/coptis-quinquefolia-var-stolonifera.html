<p>Coptis quinquefolia var. stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous golden thread, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that spreads horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, oval-shaped berries. Its leaves are typically trifoliate or palmately compound, with a distinctive waxy coating.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its alkaloid content, which has been used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
