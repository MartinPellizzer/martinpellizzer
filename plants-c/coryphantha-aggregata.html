                    <h1>Coryphantha aggregata</h1>
<p>Coryphantha aggregata, commonly known as the clustered cactus or desert globular cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, globular cactus with a dense cluster of small, ribbed stems that form a compact, rounded shape. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Coryphantha aggregata is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
