                    <h1>Corallorhiza odontorhiza f. radia</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza odontorhiza f. radia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients. The plant's slender, white stems and small, pale green flowers are adapted for specific pollinators, such as bees and wasps. Its growth is highly dependent on the presence of certain mycorrhizal fungi, which make it extremely sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in many regions.</p>
