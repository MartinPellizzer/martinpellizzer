                    <h1>Chamaepitys trifida</h1>
<p>Chamaepitys trifida, commonly known as the three-leaf pine, is a rare and endangered coniferous species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique trifoliate leaves, which consist of three needle-like segments growing from a single stem. The plant typically grows in high-elevation environments, such as rocky slopes and mountainous regions, where it forms dense, shrub-like colonies. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Chamaepitys trifida faces significant conservation challenges.</p>
