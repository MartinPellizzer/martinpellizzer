                    <h1>Cyperus rotundus var. hydra</h1>
<p>Cyperus rotundus var. hydra, commonly known as watergrass or nutsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread rapidly and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its adaptability to wet or dry conditions makes it a common weed in agricultural and aquatic environments.</p>
<p>The variety hydra is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to other Cyperus species, particularly in leaf structure and growth form.</p>
