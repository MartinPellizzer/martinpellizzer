<p>Crocodeilanthe cyathiflora, commonly known as the shield fern, is a tropical fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives on rocky surfaces or in crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Crocodeilanthe cyathiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
