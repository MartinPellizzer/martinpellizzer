<p>Catabrosa algida f. vestita, commonly known as the cold mountain catabrosa, is a rare and frost-tolerant plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, silver-white foliage covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
