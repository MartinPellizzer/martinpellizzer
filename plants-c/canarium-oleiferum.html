<p>Canarium oleiferum, commonly known as the candlenut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces drupes, or fruits, which contain a hard-shelled seed surrounded by an oily pulp. The oil extracted from the seeds is used in traditional medicine and as a source of biodiesel.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various wildlife species and contributing to soil stabilization in coastal areas.</p>
