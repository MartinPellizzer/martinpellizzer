                    <h1>Colymbada lainzii</h1>
<p>Colymbada lainzii, commonly known as the Lainz's colymbada, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to a limited geographic range, primarily in southern Europe, it thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic study.</p>
