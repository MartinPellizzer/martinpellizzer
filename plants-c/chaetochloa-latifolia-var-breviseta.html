<p>Chaetochloa latifolia var. breviseta, commonly known as the broadleaf hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The small, spike-like inflorescence produces wind-pollinated flowers, contributing to its role in wetland biodiversity.</p>
