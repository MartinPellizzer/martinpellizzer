<p>Cnemidia ctenophora, commonly known as the feathered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. This plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>Cnemidia ctenophora is a carnivorous plant that uses its specialized structures to capture and digest prey, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
