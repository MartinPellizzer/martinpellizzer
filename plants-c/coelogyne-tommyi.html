<p>Coelogyne tommyi, commonly known as the Tommy's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other objects without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a distinctive red or orange lip. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water and nutrients, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Coelogyne tommyi is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
