                    <h1>Carex krebsiana</h1>
<p>Carex krebsiana, commonly known as the Krebs' sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many sedges. Carex krebsiana typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a valuable plant for soil stabilization and ecological restoration projects.</p>
