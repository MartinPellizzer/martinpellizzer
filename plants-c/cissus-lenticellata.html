<p>Cissus lenticellata, commonly known as the sand dollar plant, is a member of the Vitaceae family and is native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a climbing or trailing plant characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits resembling sand dollars, which give it its common name. Its stems are often covered with small, raised bumps called lenticels, which aid in gas exchange.</p>
<p>Cissus lenticellata is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
