                    <h1>Caralluma lutea var. lateritia</h1>
<p>Caralluma lutea var. lateritia, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This species is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
