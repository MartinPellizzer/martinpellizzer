                    <h1>Cypripedium philippinense var. roebelenii</h1>
<p>Cypripedium philippinense var. roebelenii, commonly known as the Philippine lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped flower with a distinctive pinkish-brown color and intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, often in areas with rich organic soil. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it has specific mycorrhizal associations that are crucial for its survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is critically threatened in its natural range.</p>
