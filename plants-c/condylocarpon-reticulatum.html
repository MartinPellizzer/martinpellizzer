                    <h1>Condylocarpon reticulatum</h1>
<p>Condylocarpon reticulatum, commonly known as the netted lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a complex, branched thallus with a dense, interwoven network of hyphae that gives it its characteristic reticulate appearance. The plant's surface is often covered with a layer of crustose material, which helps it retain moisture. It is typically found on bark, stones, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which contribute to its photosynthetic capabilities.</p>
