                    <h1>Centaurea chthonocephala</h1>
<p>Centaurea chthonocephala, commonly known as the subterranean-headed centaury, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is adapted to thrive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Centaurea chthonocephala is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
