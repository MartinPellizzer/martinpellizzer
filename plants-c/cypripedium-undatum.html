                    <h1>Cypripedium undatum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium undatum, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pink or white coloration and a pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and meadows, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, and it produces a single flower per stem, often with a sweet, vanilla-like fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
