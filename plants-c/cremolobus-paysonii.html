                    <h1>Cremolobus paysonii</h1>
<p>Cremolobus paysonii, commonly known as the Payson's cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the Sonoran Desert in the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
