                    <h1>Cryosophila kalbreyeri</h1>
<p>Cryosophila kalbreyeri, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic tundra.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant has adapted to extreme cold by developing a thick, waxy cuticle on its leaves to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny areas of the tundra.</p>
<p>Cryosophila kalbreyeri plays an important role in the Arctic ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators during the short growing season.</p>
