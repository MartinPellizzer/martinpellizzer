<p>Carya buckleyi f. pachylemma, commonly known as the thick-shelled walnut, is a rare botanical variant of the black walnut species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery husks that encase the nuts, distinguishing it from typical walnut varieties. The plant is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, compound, and often have a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The thick-shelled walnut is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
