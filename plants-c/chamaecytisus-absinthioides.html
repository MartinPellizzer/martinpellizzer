<p>Chamaecytisus absinthioides, commonly known as sweet honeycomb bush, is a flowering shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features wiry, arching stems that are covered in fine, silver-gray hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, honeycomb-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to poor, rocky soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
