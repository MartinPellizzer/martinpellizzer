<p>Calanthe fulgens, commonly known as the golden calanthe, is a striking orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant orange to yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb.</p>
<p>Calanthe fulgens prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
