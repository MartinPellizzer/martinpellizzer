<p>Corbularia cantabrica var. monophylla, commonly known as the Cantabrian corbularia, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the coastal regions of northern Spain.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal habitats, where it tolerates saline and nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are broad and lanceolate, often with a distinctive white or pale underside.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species within its native range.</p>
