<p>Copiapoa melanohystrix, commonly known as the black-hystrix cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its columnar stem that is typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often appearing in late spring or early summer. It is a slow-growing species that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, and it is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular specimen among cactus enthusiasts and conservationists.</p>
