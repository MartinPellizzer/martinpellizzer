<p>Croton glandulosus var. scordioides, commonly known as the stinging croton, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves and stems contain irritant compounds, which can cause skin irritation upon contact.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value, though caution is advised due to its defensive properties.</p>
