<p>Chaerophyllum hirsutum subsp.</p>
<p>villarsii, commonly known as the Alpine cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lobed leaves and flowering stems that bear small, white, umbrella-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in alpine meadows and slopes.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly smaller flowers compared to the typical form of C. hirsutum.</p>
