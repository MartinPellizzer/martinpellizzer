<p>Cypripedium × gemmiferum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip, which is a defining feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in cool, moist forest environments, often in shaded areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers, which can be pink, white, or yellow, are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
