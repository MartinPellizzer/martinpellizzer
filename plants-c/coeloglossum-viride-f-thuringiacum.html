<p>Coeloglossum viride f. thuringiacum, commonly known as the Thuringian green helleborine, is a rare and specialized orchid species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and its showy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. This orchid is typically found in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
