                    <h1>Cenchrus asperifolius</h1>
<p>Cenchrus asperifolius, commonly known as roughleaf sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, rigid leaves with a rough, sandpaper-like texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its adaptability makes it an important component of stabilizing ecosystems in harsh climates.</p>
