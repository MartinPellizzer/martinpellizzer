<p>Cladocolea grahamii, commonly known as the Graham's leathery lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form and a dark, almost black or brownish thallus that adheres tightly to rock surfaces. The lichen typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often on exposed rock faces or soil in dry regions. It is known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions due to its protective thallus structure.</p>
<p>Cladocolea grahamii is of interest to botanists and lichenologists due to its ecological significance and unique adaptations to extreme environments.</p>
