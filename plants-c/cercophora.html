                    <h1>Cercophora</h1>
<p>Cercophora, commonly known as the common lichen, is a genus of lichens that belong to the family Pilocarpaceae.</p>
<p>These organisms are symbiotic, consisting of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Cercophora species are often found on tree trunks and branches, especially in humid and shaded environments. They play an important role in nutrient cycling and soil formation in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>The thallus of Cercophora is usually crust-like or foliose, and it can vary in color from yellow to orange or brown.</p>
