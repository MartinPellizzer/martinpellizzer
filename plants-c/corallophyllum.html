<p>Corallophyllum, commonly known as the sea fan, is a type of soft coral found in tropical and subtropical marine environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the order Gorgonacea and is characterized by its branching, fan-like structure composed of calcareous skeletal elements. The polyps of Corallophyllum are covered in tiny, transparent tentacles that capture plankton from the water. It plays an important role in reef ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for various marine species.</p>
<p>Corallophyllum thrives in shallow waters and is often found in coral reefs and seagrass beds.</p>
