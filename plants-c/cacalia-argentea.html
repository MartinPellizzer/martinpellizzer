                    <h1>Cacalia argentea</h1>
<p>Cacalia argentea, commonly known as silverweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Cacalia argentea is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in semi-arid to alpine habitats.</p>
