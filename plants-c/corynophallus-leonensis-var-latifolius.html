                    <h1>Corynophallus leonensis var. latifolius</h1>
<p>Corynophallus leonensis var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf ghost flower, is a striking member of the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that resembles a ghostly face, with a white spathe and a cluster of tiny yellowish-green spadices. The plant produces a unique, ephemeral bloom that appears briefly during the night, often disappearing by dawn. Native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a fascinating subject for both horticultural and ecological study.</p>
