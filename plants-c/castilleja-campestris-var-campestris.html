                    <h1>Castilleja campestris var. campestris</h1>
<p>Castilleja campestris var. campestris, commonly known as the plains milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks true leaves, relying on its roots to absorb water and nutrients from host plants. The plant produces bright orange or yellow flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is highly specialized, allowing it to establish itself in dry, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Castilleja campestris var. campestris is often found in grasslands and open habitats, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its environment.</p>
