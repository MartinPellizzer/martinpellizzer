<p>Cleistocactus ferrarii, commonly known as the Ferrari's close-cushion cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a dense, spiny appearance, typically growing to a height of about 10 centimeters. The plant produces yellow flowers that emerge from the areoles, usually in late spring or early summer. Its thick, ribbed stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Cleistocactus ferrarii is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and desert landscapes.</p>
