                    <h1>Calomorphe ehrenbergiana</h1>
<p>Calomorphe ehrenbergiana, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Calomorphe ehrenbergiana is adapted to survive extreme temperatures and limited water availability, making it a resilient species in harsh environments.</p>
