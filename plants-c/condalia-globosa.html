                    <h1>Condalia globosa</h1>
<p>Condalia globosa, commonly known as the globular thistle, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Condalia globosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
