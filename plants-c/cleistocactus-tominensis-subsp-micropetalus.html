<p>Cleistocactus tominensis subsp.</p>
<p>micropetalus, commonly known as the small-petalled rock cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a fine, white coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that open only briefly during the night, a feature typical of cleistocarps. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative cactus in arid gardens.</p>
