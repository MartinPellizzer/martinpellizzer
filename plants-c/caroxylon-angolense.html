                    <h1>Caroxylon angolense</h1>
<p>Caroxylon angolense, commonly known as the Angolan carob tree, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The tree produces elongated pods containing edible seeds, similar to those of the carob tree. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Caroxylon angolense is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>
