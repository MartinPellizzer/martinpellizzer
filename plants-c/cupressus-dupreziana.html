<p>Cupressus dupreziana, commonly known as the Socotra cypress, is a unique coniferous tree native to the island of Socotra in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, twisted trunk and its scale-like leaves that form dense, compact clusters. The plant belongs to the Cupressaceae family and is known for its slow growth and longevity, with some specimens living over 1,000 years. Its cones are small and contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The Socotra cypress is also notable for its ecological importance and is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage.</p>
