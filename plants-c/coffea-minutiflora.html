                    <h1>Coffea minutiflora</h1>
<p>Coffea minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf coffee plant, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact size, with slender stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries containing the seeds used for coffee. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is less commonly cultivated for commercial coffee production compared to other Coffea species.</p>
