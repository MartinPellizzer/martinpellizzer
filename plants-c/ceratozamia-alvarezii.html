                    <h1>Ceratozamia alvarezii</h1>
<p>Ceratozamia alvarezii, commonly known as the Alvarez cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Yucat√°n Peninsula in Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common among cycads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical research.</p>
<p>Its study provides valuable insights into the evolution and conservation of gymnosperms.</p>
