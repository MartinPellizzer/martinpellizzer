                    <h1>Cyperus ruficomus</h1>
<p>Cyperus ruficomus, commonly known as the red-stemmed flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Cyperus ruficomus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in waterlogged areas.</p>
