                    <h1>Cardamine macrophylla var. diplodonta</h1>
<p>Cardamine macrophylla var. diplodonta, commonly known as the large-leaf water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are often deeply lobed and can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are arranged in clusters, typically emerging from the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can influence local aquatic ecosystems.</p>
