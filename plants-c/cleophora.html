                    <h1>Cleophora</h1>
<p>Cleophora, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate appearance, with white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Cleophora thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
