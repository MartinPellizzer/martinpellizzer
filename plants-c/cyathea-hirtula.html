                    <h1>Cyathea hirtula</h1>
<p>Cyathea hirtula, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a distinctive feature of ferns. Cyathea hirtula thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of tropical forest ecosystems.</p>
