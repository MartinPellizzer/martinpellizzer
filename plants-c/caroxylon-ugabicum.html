                    <h1>Caroxylon ugabicum</h1>
<p>Caroxylon ugabicum, commonly known as the Ugab Desert date palm, is a rare and ancient plant native to the arid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and sparse, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that develop into hard, woody fruits. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect adaptations to extreme desert conditions, making it a unique example of desert flora.</p>
