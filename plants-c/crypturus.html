                    <h1>Crypturus</h1>
<p>Crypturus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers and its unique ability to grow without soil, relying instead on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi. The plant's roots are specialized to absorb nutrients from the air and water, making it a fascinating example of epiphytic growth. Crypturus is highly sensitive to environmental changes, which has led to its endangered status.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and beauty, it is a subject of both scientific interest and conservation efforts.</p>
