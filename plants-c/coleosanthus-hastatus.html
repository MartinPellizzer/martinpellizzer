                    <h1>Coleosanthus hastatus</h1>
<p>Coleosanthus hastatus, commonly known as the sword-leaved cycad, is a unique plant native to the Pacific islands of Samoa and American Samoa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that resemble swords. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a valuable component of its native ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered vulnerable to extinction.</p>
