                    <h1>Clianthus binnendyckianus</h1>
<p>Clianthus binnendyckianus, commonly known as the Kākāpō or the New Zealand giant wattle, is a striking flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is notable for its bright red or orange flowers, which appear in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often found in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and historical over-hunting, it is now considered extinct in the wild, with only a few cultivated specimens remaining.</p>
