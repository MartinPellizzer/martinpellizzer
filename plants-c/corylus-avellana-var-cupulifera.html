                    <h1>Corylus avellana var. cupulifera</h1>
<p>Corylus avellana var. cupulifera, commonly known as the horned hazel, is a variant of the common hazel native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky husks that encase the nuts, which are typically smaller and more elongated than those of the typical variety. The plant produces both male and female flowers on the same tree, with the male catkins appearing before the female flowers in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, often turning yellow in the autumn.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its edible nuts.</p>
