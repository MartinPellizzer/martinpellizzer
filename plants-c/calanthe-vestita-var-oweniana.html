<p>Calanthe vestita var. oweniana, commonly known as the Owen's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or among mossy rocks. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
