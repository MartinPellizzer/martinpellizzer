                    <h1>Carex echinata var. phyllomanica</h1>
<p>Carex echinata var. phyllomanica, commonly known as the slender spikerush, is a variant of the spikerush genus Carex.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical spikes of small, usually wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and stiff, often with a slightly rough texture, and the inflorescence is composed of several spikelets.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its subtle morphological differences from the typical Carex echinata, particularly in leaf structure and flowering patterns.</p>
