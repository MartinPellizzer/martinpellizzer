                    <h1>Cuscuta indecora var. longisepala</h1>
<p>Cuscuta indecora var. longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepaled dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that缠绕 around its hosts. The plant is characterized by its long, separate sepals and is often found growing on a variety of host species, including grasses and shrubs. It plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant growth and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
