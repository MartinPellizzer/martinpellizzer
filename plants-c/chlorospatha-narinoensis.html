<p>Chlorospatha narinoensis, commonly known as the Narino sun-leaf, is a striking member of the Araceae family native to the Andean regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, bright green leaves that are often marked with intricate white or yellow veins, giving it a sunlit appearance. The plant produces an inflorescence known as a spadix, which is surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
