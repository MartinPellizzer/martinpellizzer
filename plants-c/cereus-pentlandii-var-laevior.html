                    <h1>Cereus pentlandii var. laevior</h1>
<p>Cereus pentlandii var. laevior, commonly known as the Laevior Cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>The variety laevior is distinguished by its smoother, less ribbed stem compared to other varieties of Cereus pentlandii.</p>
