                    <h1>Cactus sepium</h1>
<p>Cactus sepium, commonly known as the desert rose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and Southwestern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically small and may be reduced to spines, a feature that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The sepium refers to the fleshy, seed-containing part of the fruit, which is adapted for dispersal by animals.</p>
