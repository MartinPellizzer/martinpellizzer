<p>Crassula argyrophylla, commonly known as the silver leaf crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, rounded rosettes of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Crassula argyrophylla prefers well-draining soil and full sun to partial shade.</p>
