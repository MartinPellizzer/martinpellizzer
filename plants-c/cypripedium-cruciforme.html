                    <h1>Cypripedium cruciforme</h1>
<p>Cypripedium cruciforme, commonly known as the cross-shaped lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, which plays a crucial role in pollination by attracting specific insects. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with a distinctive cross-shaped pattern on the petals and sepals.</p>
<p>Cypripedium cruciforme is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological significance in its native habitats.</p>
