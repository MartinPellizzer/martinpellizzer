                    <h1>Caltha stagnalis</h1>
<p>Caltha stagnalis, commonly known as the marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features showy, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>Caltha stagnalis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing nectar for early pollinators and stabilizing soil with its extensive root network.</p>
