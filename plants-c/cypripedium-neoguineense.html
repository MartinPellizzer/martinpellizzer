                    <h1>Cypripedium neoguineense</h1>
<p>Cypripedium neoguineense, commonly known as the New Guinea lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the lowland rainforests of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows from a rhizome and produces a single, upright stem with a few broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or purple with a yellow or white lip, and it blooms during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
