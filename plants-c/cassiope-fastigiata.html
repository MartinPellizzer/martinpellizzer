                    <h1>Cassiope fastigiata</h1>
<p>Cassiope fastigiata, commonly known as the dwarf mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the rocky coastal areas of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine, white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in crevices and on rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Cassiope fastigiata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in coastal landscapes.</p>
