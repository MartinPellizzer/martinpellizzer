                    <h1>Cypripedium atsmori</h1>
<p>Cypripedium atsmori, commonly known as the Atsimo杓兰, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking pink and white petals, with a distinctive yellow lip that resembles a spoon, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in cool, moist, shaded environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
