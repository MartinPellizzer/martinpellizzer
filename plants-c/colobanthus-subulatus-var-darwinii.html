<p>Colobanthus subulatus var. darwinii, commonly known as Darwin's snowgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Antarctic region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, typically from December to February. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in polar regions.</p>
