<p>Corallorhiza maculata subsp.</p>
<p>mertensiana, commonly known as the spotted coralroot, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph. It relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrition, forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in rich, organic soil. It produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red, with a distinctive spotted pattern on the petals.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to the eastern United States and is often found in association with hardwood forests.</p>
