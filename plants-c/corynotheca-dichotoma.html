                    <h1>Corynotheca dichotoma</h1>
<p>Corynotheca dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous corynotheca, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and small, pale green leaves that are arranged in a dichotomous pattern, meaning they split into two equal branches at each node. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, contributing to its ornamental value. Corynotheca dichotoma is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access groundwater.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of local flora in its native habitat.</p>
