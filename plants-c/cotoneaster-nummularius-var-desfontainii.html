                    <h1>Cotoneaster nummularius var. desfontainii</h1>
<p>Cotoneaster nummularius var. desfontainii, commonly known as the silver cotoneaster, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, round, silver-white leaves that provide a striking contrast to its vibrant red berries. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by ornamental fruits that persist into winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and dense foliage, it is often used as a hedging plant or in rock gardens.</p>
