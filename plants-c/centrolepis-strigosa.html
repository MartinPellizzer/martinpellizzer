                    <h1>Centrolepis strigosa</h1>
<p>Centrolepis strigosa, commonly known as the woolly centrolepis, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stems and feather-like, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Native to southern Africa, it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Its distinctive appearance and ancient lineage make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
