                    <h1>Ceropegia arida</h1>
<p>Ceropegia arida, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a distinctive hooded shape. Its leaves are usually reduced to small scales, further minimizing water loss.</p>
<p>Ceropegia arida is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal rainfall.</p>
