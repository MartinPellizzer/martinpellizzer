<p>Cymbiglossum, commonly known as the flame violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. They are characterized by their striking, colorful flowers that resemble violets, often with a contrasting pattern on the petals. Cymbiglossum species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in their natural habitat.</p>
<p>They require bright, indirect light and consistent moisture to thrive in cultivation.</p>
