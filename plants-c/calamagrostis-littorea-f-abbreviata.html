                    <h1>Calamagrostis littorea f. abbreviata</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis littorea f. abbreviata, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a compact, low-growing grass species native to coastal areas of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed compared to the typical form of Calamagrostis littorea. The plant thrives in moist, saline environments, often found in salt marshes and along shorelines. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, fluffy flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This form is notable for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils through its extensive root system.</p>
