<p>Callitriche tenuifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved water-starwort, is a small aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in width. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often floating on the water surface. It is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediments.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed waters make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
