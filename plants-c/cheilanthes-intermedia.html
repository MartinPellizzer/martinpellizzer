                    <h1>Cheilanthes intermedia</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are resistant to drought. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in crevices or on cliffs.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
