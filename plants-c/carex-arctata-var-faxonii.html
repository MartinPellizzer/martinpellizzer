                    <h1>Carex arctata var. faxonii</h1>
<p>Carex arctata var. faxonii, commonly known as the Faxon's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern United States and southern Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomes contribute to its ability to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>This species is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability to waterlogged soils.</p>
