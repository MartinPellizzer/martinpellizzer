                    <h1>Casearia singularis</h1>
<p>Casearia singularis, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale-gray bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine white powder. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in saline and waterlogged soils, making it an important species in mangrove ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate salt and tidal conditions contributes to its role in coastal stabilization and biodiversity.</p>
