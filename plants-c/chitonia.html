                    <h1>Chitonia</h1>
<p>Chitonia, commonly known as the sea hare, is a type of marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Aplysiidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and often vibrant coloration, which can serve as a form of camouflage or warning to predators. Chitonia species are typically found in shallow coastal waters and are known for their ability to secrete a mucus that aids in locomotion and protection. They play an important role in marine ecosystems by grazing on algae and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Their anatomy includes a radula, a specialized feeding structure used to scrape food from surfaces.</p>
