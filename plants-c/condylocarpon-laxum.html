                    <h1>Condylocarpon laxum</h1>
<p>Condylocarpon laxum, commonly known as the common lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in a variety of environments, including tree bark, soil, and rock surfaces. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is the body of the lichen, and it lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. It plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in extreme conditions makes it an important indicator species for environmental health.</p>
