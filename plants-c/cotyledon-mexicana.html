<p>Cotyledon mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican arrowleaf, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are capable of photosynthesis, allowing it to survive in arid environments with minimal water.</p>
<p>Cotyledon mexicana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and resilience.</p>
