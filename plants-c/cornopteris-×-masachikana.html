                    <h1>Cornopteris × masachikana</h1>
<p>Cornopteris × masachikana, commonly known as the hybrid rock fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Cornopteris leioptera and Cornopteris mackayi.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that often exhibit a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky, shaded environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it is often found in forested areas with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival.</p>
