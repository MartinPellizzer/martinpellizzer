<p>Copiapoa cinerea var. eremophila, commonly known as the pale copiapoa, is a cacti species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem with a grayish-green color and a powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat in an arid environment, it is adapted to survive with minimal water and extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
