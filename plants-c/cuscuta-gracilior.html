                    <h1>Cuscuta gracilior</h1>
<p>Cuscuta gracilior, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and can be found growing on a variety of herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread easily.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and ornamental plants.</p>
