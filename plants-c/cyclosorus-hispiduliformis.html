                    <h1>Cyclosorus hispiduliformis</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus hispiduliformis, commonly known as the hairy leaf liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a thalloid structure with a distinctive, hairy appearance on its leaves, which aids in moisture retention. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense, instead having a protonemal system and a leafy gametophyte.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus hispiduliformis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
