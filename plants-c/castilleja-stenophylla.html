                    <h1>Castilleja stenophylla</h1>
<p>Castilleja stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients through its root system. The plant is characterized by its yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in shaping plant community structures in its native range.</p>
