                    <h1>Cenchrus ciliaris var. anachoreticus</h1>
<p>Cenchrus ciliaris var. anachoreticus, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions, making it a valuable forage grass for livestock in dry environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes preventing soil erosion and supporting local wildlife.</p>
