<p>Cyclosorus subochthodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a species of aquatic fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus subochthodes plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish.</p>
