                    <h1>Calycothrix depressa</h1>
<p>Calycothrix depressa, commonly known as the flat-leaved marsh plant, is a small, herbaceous species native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a short, creeping stem. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling a head or cluster. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its moist habitat.</p>
<p>Calycothrix depressa is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in saturated soils.</p>
