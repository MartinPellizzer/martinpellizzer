                    <h1>Crepidomanes vitiense</h1>
<p>Crepidomanes vitiense, commonly known as the Vitiense rock fern, is a rare and unique species native to the island of Vanuatu.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, epiphytic growth habit, often found on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a narrow, linear shape and small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and ecological role within its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, it remains a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
