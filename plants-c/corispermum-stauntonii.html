<p>Corispermum stauntonii, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in small, hard capsules, which help in dispersal by wind or through attachment to animals.</p>
