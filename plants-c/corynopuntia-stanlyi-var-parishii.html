<p>Corynopuntia stanlyi var. parishii, commonly known as the Paraguay apple cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Paraguay and Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, sprawling cactus with cylindrical stems that are typically ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, apple-like fruits that are edible for both humans and animals. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique fruit.</p>
