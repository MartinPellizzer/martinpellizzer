                    <h1>Claoxylon oliganthum</h1>
<p>Claoxylon oliganthum, commonly known as the rare and endemic tree of Borneo, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves that are alternately arranged along the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in axillary clusters, and its fruits are capsule-like structures containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Its botanical study is important for understanding the biodiversity of Borneo's rainforests.</p>
