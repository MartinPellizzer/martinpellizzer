                    <h1>Cuscuta leptantha</h1>
<p>Cuscuta leptantha, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that begins with seeds germinating on the surface of host plants. The plant forms a dense network of yellow stems that wrap around its host, extracting water and nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. It is often found growing on various herbaceous plants, particularly in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host, sometimes leading to reduced growth or even death.</p>
