                            <h1>Castilleja Applegatei Subsp. Martini</h1>
<p>Applegate's paintbrush, scientifically known as Castilleja applegatei subsp. martini, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the western United States. This hemiparasitic species relies on other plants for part of its nutrition while still performing photosynthesis. Its vivid red and orange flowers make it a standout in its native habitat, often found in open meadows and dry slopes. The plant's unique appearance and limited distribution have made it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Applegate's paintbrush faces increasing threats to its survival.</p>
