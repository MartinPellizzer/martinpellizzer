                    <h1>Claytonia ramosissima</h1>
<p>Claytonia ramosissima, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid or high-altitude habitat. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers during the spring, which are borne on long, slender stalks. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
