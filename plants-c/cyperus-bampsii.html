<p>Cyperus bampsii, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and three-ranked leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in wetland or marshy environments. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically brown or purple in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common colonizer of disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Cyperus bampsii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
