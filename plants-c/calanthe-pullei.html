                    <h1>Calanthe pullei</h1>
<p>Calanthe pullei, commonly known as the golden calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rhizomatous growth habit with showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with a deep yellow lip. The plant produces a single, upright spike bearing several blooms, each with intricate petal patterns. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and arranged in a rosette at the base.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calanthe pullei is considered a conservation concern.</p>
