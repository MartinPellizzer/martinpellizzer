                            <h1>Crataegus Monogyna Subf. Filicifolia</h1>
<p>Common hawthorn, scientifically known as Crataegus monogyna subf. filicifolia, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is recognized for its ornamental value, featuring clusters of white or pink flowers in spring and red berries in autumn. This plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and gardens. Its compact size and seasonal displays make it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration. Despite its beauty, it can be invasive in certain regions, requiring careful management to prevent overgrowth.</p>
