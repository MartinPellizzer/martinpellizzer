                    <h1>Chouxia borealis</h1>
<p>Chouxia borealis, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with erect, hairless stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing white or pale blue flowers that are attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette, adapting to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits.</p>
<p>Chouxia borealis is well-suited to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient member of Arctic flora.</p>
