<p>Celerina seyrigii var. egena, commonly known as the Egena celerina, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like foliage and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in umbels. Native to specific regions in South America, this variant thrives in moist, temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural study and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
