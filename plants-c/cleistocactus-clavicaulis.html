<p>Cleistocactus clavicaulis, commonly known as the "clavicle cactus," is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight.

It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in succulent gardens.</p>
