<p>Chondrilla bosseana, commonly known as the Bosse's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, adapting it to drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a dense, terminal cluster, which bloom during the rainy season. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes other flowering plants with similar structural features.</p>
<p>Chondrilla bosseana is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations.</p>
