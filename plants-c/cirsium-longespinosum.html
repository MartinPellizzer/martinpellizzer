<p>Cirsium longespinosum, commonly known as the long-spined thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant has deeply lobed, silver-green leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Cirsium longespinosum is known for its defensive spines, which deter herbivores and aid in seed dispersal.</p>
