<p>Cereus acutangulus, commonly known as the sharp-angled cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant features areoles, which are small, raised structures from which spines, flowers, and branches emerge. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, opening at night and emitting a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Cereus acutangulus is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and having a slow growth rate.</p>
