                    <h1>Cnicus desertorum</h1>
<p>Cnicus desertorum, commonly known as the desert sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with a distinctive rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, prickly fruits. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with deep roots and a waxy leaf coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cnicus desertorum is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of nutrient-poor environments.</p>
