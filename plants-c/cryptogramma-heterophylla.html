<p>Cryptogramma heterophylla, commonly known as the variable cryptogramma, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Cryptogramma heterophylla thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its variability in leaf shape and size contributes to its common name and makes it a distinctive member of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
