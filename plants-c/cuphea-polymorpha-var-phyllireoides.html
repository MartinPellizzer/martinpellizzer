                    <h1>Cuphea polymorpha var. phyllireoides</h1>
<p>Cuphea polymorpha var. phyllireoides, commonly known as the flame flower or red cuphea, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, tubular red bracts that resemble flames, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers inside the bracts, which bloom in summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners in warm climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators like hummingbirds.</p>
