                    <h1>Cupressus lawsoniana fletcheri</h1>
<p>Cupressus lawsoniana fletcheri, commonly known as the Lawson cypress, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves and its distinctive, pyramid-shaped crown. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Its botanical features include small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of coniferous trees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
