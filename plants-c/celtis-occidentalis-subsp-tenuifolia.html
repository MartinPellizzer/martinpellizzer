<p>Celtis occidentalis subsp.</p>
<p>tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf boxelder, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5-9 cm long and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and later develops small, round, smooth fruits known as samaras. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in moist, open woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The subspecies is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes used in urban landscaping due to its tolerance of urban conditions.</p>
