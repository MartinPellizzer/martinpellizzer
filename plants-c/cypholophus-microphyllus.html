                    <h1>Cypholophus microphyllus</h1>
<p>Cypholophus microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaf cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy form and its distinctive, feather-like leaves that are relatively small compared to other cycads. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and the plant is adapted to arid and tropical environments.</p>
<p>Cypholophus microphyllus is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades.</p>
