                    <h1>Calystegia soldanella var. albiflora</h1>
<p>Calystegia soldanella var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered field bindweed, is a variant of the field bindweed species native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial vine characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in late summer. Its hairy stems and fibrous roots allow it to thrive in disturbed soils and sunny environments.</p>
<p>However, due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
