<p>Cistus hirsutus var. brevifolius, commonly known as the short-leaved rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils. Its leaves are generally shorter and more densely packed compared to other Cistus species, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
