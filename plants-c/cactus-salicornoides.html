                    <h1>Cactus salicornoides</h1>
<p>Cactus salicornoides, commonly known as the sea hedgehog, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a dense cluster of spiny, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant's stems are typically green or bluish-green, with small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. It produces small yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a subtle ornamental value.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and adaptations make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens in hot, dry climates.</p>
