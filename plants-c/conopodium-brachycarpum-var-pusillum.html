                    <h1>Conopodium brachycarpum var. pusillum</h1>
<p>Conopodium brachycarpum var. pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the Lentibulariaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and specialized structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms. This plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. It thrives in nutrient-rich environments and is often associated with muddy substrates.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
