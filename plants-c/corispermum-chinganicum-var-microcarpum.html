                    <h1>Corispermum chinganicum var. microcarpum</h1>
<p>Corispermum chinganicum var. microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited sandmat, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of prostrate stems covered with fine, soft hairs. The leaves are small, linear, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, pale yellow, and clustered in branched inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are adapted for dispersal by wind, typical of its harsh, dry habitat.</p>
