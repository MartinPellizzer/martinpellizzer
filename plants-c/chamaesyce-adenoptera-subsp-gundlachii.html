<p>Chamaesyce adenoptera subsp.</p>
<p>gundlachii, commonly known as the Gundlach's sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It typically features prostrate or ascending stems that are covered in fine, hairy structures, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are usually lobed and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats.</p>
