                    <h1>Codonoboea nivea</h1>
<p>Codonoboea nivea, commonly known as the snow codonopsis, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling those of the bellflower family. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Codonoboea nivea is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
