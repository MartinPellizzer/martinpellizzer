<p>Callitriche palustris subsp.</p>
<p>subanceps, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and slow-moving freshwater environments. It typically grows in shallow water, often in muddy or sandy substrates, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and tiny, opposite leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality in its habitat.</p>
