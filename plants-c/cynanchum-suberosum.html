<p>Cynanchum suberosum, commonly known as the woody milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to regions of Asia, including China and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap, which is toxic, contains cardiac glycosides, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans.</p>
<p>The species is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
