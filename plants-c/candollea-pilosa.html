<p>Candollea pilosa, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant in the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Candollea pilosa is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance in aquatic gardens.</p>
