<p>Cochemiea thornberi subsp.</p>
<p>yaquensis, commonly known as the Yaquense Hedgehog Cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of southern Mexico. It typically grows to a height of about 20 centimeters and features a compact, rounded stem covered in dense, woolly white hairs.</p>
