<p>Carduus pycnocephalus subsp.</p>
<p>arabicus, commonly known as the Arabian thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a dense, spherical cluster of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Its robust structure and hardy nature make it a common weed in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for insects and serving as a pioneer species in degraded habitats.</p>
