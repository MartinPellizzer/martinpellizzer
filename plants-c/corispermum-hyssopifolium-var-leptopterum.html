                    <h1>Corispermum hyssopifolium var. leptopterum</h1>
<p>Corispermum hyssopifolium var. leptopterum, commonly known as the slender-leaved glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, typical of plants in arid or coastal regions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are often wind-pollinated. Its leaves are usually narrow and pointed, with a reduced number of lobes compared to the typical species.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in salt marshes and along the edges of saline lakes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
