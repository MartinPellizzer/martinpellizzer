                    <h1>Cissampelopsis</h1>
<p>Cissampelopsis, commonly known as the climbing mistletoe, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are hemiparasitic, meaning they derive some of their nutrients from host trees while also performing photosynthesis. Cissampelopsis species typically have opposite, simple leaves and produce showy, often orange or red, floral clusters. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine.</p>
