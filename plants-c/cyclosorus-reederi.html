                    <h1>Cyclosorus reederi</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus reederi, commonly known as the Reeder's water clover, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, often forming dense mats. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually submerged and pollinated by aquatic insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus reederi is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health.</p>
