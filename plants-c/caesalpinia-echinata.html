                    <h1>Caesalpinia echinata</h1>
<p>Caesalpinia echinata, commonly known as Brazilian rosewood, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and distinctive red, spiny pods. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, dark seeds. It is well adapted to tropical climates and is often found in dry, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its high value for timber, it has been heavily exploited, leading to significant declines in its natural populations.</p>
