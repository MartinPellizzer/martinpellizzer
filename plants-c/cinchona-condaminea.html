                    <h1>Cinchona condaminea</h1>
<p>Cinchona condaminea, commonly known as the yellow quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces bright red, ornamental berries that are a key feature of its botanical appearance. It is closely related to other cinchona species, which are historically known for their medicinal properties, particularly the production of quinine.</p>
<p>However, unlike some related species, Cinchona condaminea is not primarily cultivated for its medicinal alkaloids.</p>
