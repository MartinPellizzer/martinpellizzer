<p>Cirsium × vodicense, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It exhibits hybrid traits due to crosses between different Cirsium species, leading to variability in its morphology.</p>
<p>The plant is sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions.</p>
