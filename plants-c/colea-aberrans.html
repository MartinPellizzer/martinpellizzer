                    <h1>Colea aberrans</h1>
<p>Colea aberrans, commonly known as the variable coleworts, is a unique species within the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its biennial or perennial growth habit and is native to the mountainous regions of South America. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels. Colea aberrans is notable for its variability in leaf shape and flowering patterns, which has led to the recognition of several subspecies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
