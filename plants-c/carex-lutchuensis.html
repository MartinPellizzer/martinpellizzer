                    <h1>Carex lutchuensis</h1>
<p>Carex lutchuensis, commonly known as Lutchuensis sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly the island of Borneo. This perennial plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it forms dense clumps of grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish itself in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
