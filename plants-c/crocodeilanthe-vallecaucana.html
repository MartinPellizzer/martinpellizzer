                    <h1>Crocodeilanthe vallecaucana</h1>
<p>Crocodeilanthe vallecaucana, commonly known as the Vallecaucan fern, is a rare and unique species native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its humid, shaded habitat. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in dense, terminal clusters, a feature common among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
