                    <h1>Conophyllum moniliforme</h1>
<p>Conophyllum moniliforme, commonly known as the bead lichen, is a unique lichen species characterized by its distinctive bead-like structure.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caloplacaceae and is typically found growing on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant forms a crustose thallus with a granular appearance, composed of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and a green alga. Its morphology includes small, rounded lobes that resemble beads, hence its common name.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator of environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution.</p>
