                    <h1>Cyrtococcum trigonum</h1>
<p>Cyrtococcum trigonum, commonly known as the three-angled mossy cushion, is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cystothecaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces tiny, irregularly shaped fruiting bodies called peridia, which are often covered in a layer of moss-like structures. Cyrtococcum trigonum is typically found in temperate regions, growing on decaying wood or soil in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
