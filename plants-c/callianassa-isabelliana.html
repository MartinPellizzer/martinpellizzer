                    <h1>Callianassa isabelliana</h1>
<p>Callianassa isabelliana, commonly known as the isabelline ghost shrimp, is a marine decapod crustacean rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, elongated body and is often found in sandy or muddy substrates in coastal areas. The species is named after Isabella, likely in reference to a person or place. It plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to sediment turnover and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Due to its non-plant nature, it is not studied in botanical contexts.</p>
