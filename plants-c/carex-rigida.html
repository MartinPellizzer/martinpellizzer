<p>Carex rigida, commonly known as rigid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stiff, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands.</p>
<p>Carex rigida is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
