                    <h1>Cyclostemon griffithii</h1>
<p>Cyclostemon griffithii, commonly known as the Himalayan cycad, is a unique plant native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a gymnosperm, characterized by its unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
