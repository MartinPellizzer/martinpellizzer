<p>Cynorkis humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, palm-like leaves. Native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly Madagascar, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cynorkis humbertii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
