<p>Cerastium decalvans var. kitanovii, commonly known as the Kitanov's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
