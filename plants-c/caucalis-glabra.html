                    <h1>Caucalis glabra</h1>
<p>Caucalis glabra, commonly known as the smooth bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant is known for its ability to capture small aquatic organisms using specialized bladder-like structures called bladders. These bladders function as traps to immobilize prey, which the plant then digests for nutrients.</p>
<p>Caucalis glabra typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches.</p>
