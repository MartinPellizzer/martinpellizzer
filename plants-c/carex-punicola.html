<p>Carex punicola, commonly known as the redstem sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges.</p>
<p>Carex punicola is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
