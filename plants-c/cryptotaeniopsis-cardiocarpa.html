                    <h1>Cryptotaeniopsis cardiocarpa</h1>
<p>Cryptotaeniopsis cardiocarpa, commonly known as the heart-shaped fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant's unique heart-shaped spore-bearing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
