                    <h1>Convallaria majalis f. abchasica</h1>
<p>Convallaria majalis f. abchasica, commonly known as the Abkhazian lily, is a rare and striking variant of the lily family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and tall, upright stems that bear clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers. This form is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, particularly in Abkhazia, where it thrives in cool, moist, woodland environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
