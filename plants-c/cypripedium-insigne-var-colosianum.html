                    <h1>Cypripedium insigne var. colosianum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium insigne var. colosianum, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pink or white pouch-shaped lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on the nutrients from decaying organic matter. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
