                    <h1>Cerastium szowitsii var. glabratum</h1>
<p>Cerastium szowitsii var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features prostrate or ascending stems covered with small, rounded, glabrous (hairless) leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth and ornamental flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
