<p>Cammarum hyemale, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth, waxy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Cammarum hyemale is now classified as an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
