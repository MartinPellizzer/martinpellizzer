                    <h1>Cynodon dactylon var. arcuatus</h1>
<p>Cynodon dactylon var. arcuatus, commonly known as the bentgrass or African carpet grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often folded in a V-shape. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in warm climates and is highly adaptable to various soil types, making it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form a dense cover make it both a useful forage crop and a persistent weed.</p>
