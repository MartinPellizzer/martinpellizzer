                    <h1>Clematis calcicola</h1>
<p>Clematis calcicola, commonly known as the limestone clematis, is a perennial vine native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, usually blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. Its leaves are typically compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
