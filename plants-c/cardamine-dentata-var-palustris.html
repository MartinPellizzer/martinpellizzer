                    <h1>Cardamine dentata var. palustris</h1>
<p>Cardamine dentata var. palustris, commonly known as the bog water-crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, acidic waters and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a loose cluster, which bloom in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor aquatic soils, allowing it to thrive in marshy conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
