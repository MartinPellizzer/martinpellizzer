<p>Cephalophyllum worcesterense, commonly known as Worcester's headplant, is a rare and specialized member of the Portulacaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
