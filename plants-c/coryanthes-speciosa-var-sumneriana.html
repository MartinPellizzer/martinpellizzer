                    <h1>Coryanthes speciosa var. sumneriana</h1>
<p>Coryanthes speciosa var. sumneriana, commonly known as the Sumner's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pale pink or white flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip that resembles a ghostly face, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom, including high humidity and nutrient-rich substrates. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, primarily beetles, which are attracted to the scent and structure of the blooms.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its rarity, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in its native range.</p>
