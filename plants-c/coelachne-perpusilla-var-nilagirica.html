The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are typically greenish or pale yellow in color. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in shaded, forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
