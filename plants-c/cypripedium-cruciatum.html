                    <h1>Cypripedium cruciatum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium cruciatum, commonly known as the cross-lobed lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like flower with a deep violet to purple hue and intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on decaying organic matter. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces a single, showy bloom each year.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
