                    <h1>Cereus propinquus</h1>
<p>Cereus propinquus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cacti species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to thrive in arid environments with minimal water. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and they emit a sweet scent to enhance pollination.</p>
