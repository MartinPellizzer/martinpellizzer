                    <h1>Cupressus lusitanica f. vulgaris</h1>
<p>Cupressus lusitanica f. vulgaris, commonly known as the Portuguese cypress, is a compact, evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features scale-like leaves that are dense and dark green, arranged in crossed pairs along the branches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that are followed by narrow, cylindrical cones. It is well adapted to coastal and rocky environments, tolerating salty air and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its neat, conical shape and resilience to urban conditions.</p>
