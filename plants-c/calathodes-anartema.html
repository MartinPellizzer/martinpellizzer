<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and gelatinous berries. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host plants.</p>
