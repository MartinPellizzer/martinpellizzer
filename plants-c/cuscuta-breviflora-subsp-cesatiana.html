<p>Cuscuta breviflora subsp.</p>
<p>cesatiana, commonly known as the short-flowered dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, thread-like appearance due to its lack of true leaves.</p>
<p>The plant is native to regions in the Mediterranean and parts of Asia, where it often infests a variety of herbaceous hosts. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
