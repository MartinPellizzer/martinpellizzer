                    <h1>Castilleja densiflora var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Castilleja densiflora var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender leaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red to orange floral bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its root system to absorb nutrients from host plants, typically grasses and shrubs. It produces small, tubular flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its growth habit is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
