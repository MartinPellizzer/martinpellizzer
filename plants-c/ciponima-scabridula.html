                    <h1>Ciponima scabridula</h1>
<p>Ciponima scabridula, commonly known as the rough-leaved ciponima, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a rough, textured surface due to the presence of fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, usually greenish-white in color, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
