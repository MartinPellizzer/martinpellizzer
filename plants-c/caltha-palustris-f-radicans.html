                    <h1>Caltha palustris f. radicans</h1>
<p>Caltha palustris f. radicans, commonly known as the creeping marsh marigold, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas in northern regions.</p>
<p>It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before its leaves emerge. The plant has fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in damp environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can stabilize soil in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its trailing stems that root at the nodes, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
