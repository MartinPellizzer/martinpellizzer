<p>Cistanche ambigua, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to species of Haloxylon and other shrubs. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers and has a distinctive, fleshy, branching stem. It is native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and ecological role, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
