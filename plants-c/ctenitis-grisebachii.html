                    <h1>Ctenitis grisebachii</h1>
<p>Ctenitis grisebachii, commonly known as the gray fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form dense, floating mats on water surfaces. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating the spread of new growth.</p>
<p>Ctenitis grisebachii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
