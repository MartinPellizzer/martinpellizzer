                    <h1>Celtis aculeata</h1>
<p>Celtis aculeata, commonly known as the burr maple or nettle tree, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges and a distinctive, rough, bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits that have hooked spines, aiding in seed dispersal by animals. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties.</p>
<p>Celtis aculeata is adaptable to various soil types and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas.</p>
