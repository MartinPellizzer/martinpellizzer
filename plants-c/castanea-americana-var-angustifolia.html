                    <h1>Castanea americana var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Castanea americana var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chestnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically 4â€“8 inches long and have a serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of spiny, burr-like fruits that contain one or two edible nuts. Its flowers are small, inconspicuous, and typically appear in early spring before the leaves.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the American chestnut but is smaller in size and has a more limited range.</p>
