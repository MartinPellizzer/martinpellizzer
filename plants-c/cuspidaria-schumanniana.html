                    <h1>Cuspidaria schumanniana</h1>
<p>Cuspidaria schumanniana, commonly known as the Schumann's cusk-fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, arching fronds with a distinctive, narrow, and pointed shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
