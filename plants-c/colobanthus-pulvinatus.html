<p>Colobanthus pulvinatus, commonly known as the Antarctic pearlwort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it survive in cold and arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the short growing season in its habitat. It is adapted to extreme conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures, making it a resilient species.</p>
<p>Colobanthus pulvinatus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation.</p>
