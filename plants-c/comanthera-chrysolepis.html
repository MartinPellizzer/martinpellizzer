                    <h1>Comanthera chrysolepis</h1>
<p>Comanthera chrysolepis, commonly known as the goldenleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange thallus, which gives it its common name. The lichen consists of a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to photosynthesize and absorb nutrients from the substrate. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecosystem health.</p>
