                    <h1>Cyperus subpinnatus</h1>
<p>Cyperus subpinnatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf paperplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in clusters at the base of the plant. Cyperus subpinnatus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it both a useful wetland indicator and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
