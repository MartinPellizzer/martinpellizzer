<p>Cardamine franklinensis, commonly known as Franklin's water shield, is a rare aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has small, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in a single umbel, and it produces small, elliptical fruits.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and pollution, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
