<p>Calamagrostis purpurea subsp.</p>
<p>phragmitoides, commonly known as purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and panicles of purple or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an effective pioneer species in disturbed or wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
