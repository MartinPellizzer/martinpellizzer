<p>Atlantic bellflower, scientifically known as Cynoglossum creticum var. atlanticum, is a rare and striking plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic. This low-growing perennial is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along rocky shores. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique flora from environmental threats.</p>
