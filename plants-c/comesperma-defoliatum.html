                    <h1>Comesperma defoliatum</h1>
<p>Comesperma defoliatum, commonly known as the leafless comesperma, is a unique plant species native to specific regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves, which is an adaptation to its arid environment. Instead of leaves, it has modified stems that perform photosynthesis. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant adaptations to extreme climates.</p>
