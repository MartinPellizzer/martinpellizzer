<p>Purple coneflower, scientifically known as Chasea capillaris, is a striking perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is prized for its vibrant purple petals and distinctive cone-shaped center, which make it a popular choice among gardeners and wildflower enthusiasts. This species thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies adds ecological value to its habitat. With its elegant appearance and ecological benefits, the purple coneflower is both a beautiful and essential part of native plant ecosystems.</p>
