                    <h1>Cleistocactus plagiostoma</h1>
<p>Cleistocactus plagiostoma, commonly known as the "Bottle Cactus," is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem that resembles a bottle, which is covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are typically hidden within the stem and only open under specific conditions. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Cleistocactus plagiostoma is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
