                    <h1>Corrigiola imbricata</h1>
<p>Corrigiola imbricata, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and coastal areas.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or on limestone outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
