                    <h1>Caraipa foveolata</h1>
<p>Caraipa foveolata, commonly known as the Caribbean rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, spiny growth form and thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually small and yellow or orange, blooming in the spring.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Caraipa foveolata is considered threatened in some areas.</p>
