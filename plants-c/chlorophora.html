                    <h1>Chlorophora</h1>
<p>Chlorophora, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its smooth, often aromatic bark and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it popular in the furniture and construction industries.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, several species within the genus are now threatened with extinction.</p>
