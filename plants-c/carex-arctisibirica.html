                    <h1>Carex arctisibirica</h1>
<p>Carex arctisibirica, commonly known as the Siberian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in tundra or alpine environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Carex arctisibirica is an important component of the vegetation in its native ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
