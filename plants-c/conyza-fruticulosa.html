<p>Conyza fruticulosa, commonly known as the hairy weed or false dandelion, is an annual herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, white pubescence.

It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Conyza fruticulosa is considered a weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas.</p>
