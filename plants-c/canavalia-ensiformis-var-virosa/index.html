<p>Cowpea, scientifically known as Canavalia ensiformis var. virosa, is a versatile legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. This plant is widely cultivated for its edible beans, which are rich in protein and nutrients. It thrives in warm climates and is commonly grown in many parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The cowpea's ability to fix nitrogen in the soil makes it an important crop for sustainable agriculture. Its resilience and adaptability have made it a staple in many traditional diets around the world.</p>
