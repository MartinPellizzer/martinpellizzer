<p>Caucalis heterocarpa, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub with succulent, fleshy stems that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically small, narrow, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Caucalis heterocarpa is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species.</p>
