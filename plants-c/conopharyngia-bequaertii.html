<p>Conopharyngia bequaertii, commonly known as the African horned frog, is a unique plant species native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, tuberous roots and thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, adapted for pollination by insects. Its growth habit is primarily subterranean, with above-ground structures serving mainly for reproduction.</p>
<p>Conopharyngia bequaertii plays a role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to soil stability.</p>
