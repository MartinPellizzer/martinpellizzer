                    <h1>Cleistocactus strausii var. jujuyensis</h1>
<p>Cleistocactus strausii var. jujuyensis, commonly known as the Jujuy cactus, is a species native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, globular cactus with a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, a characteristic feature of its nocturnal pollination strategy. Its spines are short and dense, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
