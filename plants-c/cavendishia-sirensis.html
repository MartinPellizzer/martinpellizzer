<p>Cavendishia sirensis, commonly known as the Siren's Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, violet-blue petals and a unique, elongated flower structure that sets it apart from other orchid species. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to tree trunks and branches in its humid, shaded habitat. Its flowers bloom in late spring, releasing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Cavendishia sirensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
