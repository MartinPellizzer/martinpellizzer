<p>Cyperus difformis var. breviglobosus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedgeland, is a variant of the sedgeland plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats.</p>
