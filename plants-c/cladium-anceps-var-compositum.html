                    <h1>Cladium anceps var. compositum</h1>
<p>Cladium anceps var. compositum, commonly known as the dwarf papyrus, is a monocotyledonous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated, a common trait among sedges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The plant's adaptability to waterlogged conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
