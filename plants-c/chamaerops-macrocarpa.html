<p>Chamaerops macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant date palm, is a striking evergreen tree native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features a tall, slender trunk with a crown of long, arching fronds that can reach up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces large, clustered inflorescences that bear edible dates, although it is not as widely cultivated for fruit as other date palm species. Its distinctive appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green and have a waxy texture, contributing to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
