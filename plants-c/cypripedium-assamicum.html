<p>Cypripedium assamicum, commonly known as the Assam yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow pouch-shaped lip, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats at high altitudes. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, showy flower each year.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
