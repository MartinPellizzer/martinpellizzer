<p>Cycas aurea, commonly known as the golden cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Cycas aurea thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and historical significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
