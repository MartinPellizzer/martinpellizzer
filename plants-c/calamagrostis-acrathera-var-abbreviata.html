                    <h1>Calamagrostis acrathera var. abbreviata</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis acrathera var. abbreviata, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, blue-green leaves and compact growth habit, making it suitable for ornamental and erosion control purposes. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle floral display.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it is occasionally used in native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
