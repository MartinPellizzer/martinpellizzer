                    <h1>Clidemia charadrophila</h1>
<p>Clidemia charadrophila, commonly known as the red-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows in the understory of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green to reddish-brown leaves. The plant has small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Clidemia charadrophila is often found in the Caribbean, Central America, and parts of South America.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to draw nutrients from its host plants, contributing to the complex ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
