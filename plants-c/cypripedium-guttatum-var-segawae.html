                    <h1>Cypripedium guttatum var. segawae</h1>
<p>Cypripedium guttatum var. segawae, commonly known as the Segawa's lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive pinkish-purple flowers with a prominent, pouch-like lip that is often adorned with a yellowish mark. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
