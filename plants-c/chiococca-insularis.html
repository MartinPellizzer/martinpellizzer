                <h1>Chiococca insularis</h1>
<p>Chiococca insularis, commonly known as the island chiococca, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the Gal√°pagos Islands.</p>
<p>It is a woody shrub that typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the island's humid evergreen forests. The plant features small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture and produces clusters of tiny, white, fragrant flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release minute seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chiococca insularis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
