<p>Cynosurus echinatus subsp.</p>
<p>elegans, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland margins and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological habitats and a subject of study in plant taxonomy.</p>
