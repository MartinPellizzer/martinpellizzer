                    <h1>Carya × collina</h1>
<p>Carya × collina, commonly known as the burr oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the white oak (Quercus alba) and the chestnut oak (Quercus prinus).</p>
<p>It is a large, slow-growing tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, characterized by its thick, fissured bark and deeply lobed leaves. The tree produces acorns that are encased in a dense, prickly cap, which provides protection for the seeds. Carya × collina thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in the eastern United States, particularly in forested areas.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
