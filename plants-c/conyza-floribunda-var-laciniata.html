                    <h1>Conyza floribunda var. laciniata</h1>
<p>Conyza floribunda var. laciniata, commonly known as the cutleaf conyza, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely dissected, lobed leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grassland and coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through wind-dispersed seeds make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
