                    <h1>Cardamine vulgaris var. oligozyga</h1>
<p>Cardamine vulgaris var. oligozyga, commonly known as the narrow-leaved watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, alternate, lanceolate leaves that are often submerged or floating on the surface of water. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers arranged in terminal clusters, which are followed by small, elongated siliques containing numerous seeds. It thrives in nutrient-rich, shallow waters and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its aquatic nature, it plays a role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
