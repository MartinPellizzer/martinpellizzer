                    <h1>Cousinia triflora</h1>
<p>Cousinia triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered cushion plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Cousinia triflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with dry, sunny conditions.</p>
