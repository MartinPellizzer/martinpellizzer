                    <h1>Coursetia caribaea var. pacifica</h1>
<p>Coursetia caribaea var. pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific coursetia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of Central America and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along coastal dunes and cliffs, where it is adapted to salty air and strong winds. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, providing some resistance to salt spray and wind damage.</p>
<p>The Pacific coursetia is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize sand dunes.</p>
