                    <h1>Cyclosorus × nareshii</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus × nareshii, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a rare and fascinating hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cyclosorus sibiricus and Cyclosorus macrophyllus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that resemble those of its parent species, with a distinctive pattern of pinnae that sets it apart. This plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and ponds, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a hybrid, offering insights into the genetic diversity and adaptability of aquatic ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
