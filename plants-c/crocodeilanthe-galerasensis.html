<p>Crocodeilanthe galerasensis, commonly known as the Galeras fern, is a unique epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the cloud forests of Colombia, specifically in the Andean region near the Galeras volcano. The plant features a creeping rhizome with dense, lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. Its reproductive structures include sori that are clustered and covered by a thin indusium, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
