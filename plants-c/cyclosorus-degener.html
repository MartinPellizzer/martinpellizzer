<p>Cyclosorus degener, commonly known as the Degener's water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
