<p>Cordylanthus pilosus subsp.</p>
<p>diffusus, commonly known as the diffuse hairysage, is a perennial herb native to California. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology compared to the main species, including more diffuse growth habits.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid environments.</p>
