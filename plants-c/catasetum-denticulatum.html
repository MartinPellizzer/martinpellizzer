                    <h1>Catasetum denticulatum</h1>
<p>Catasetum denticulatum, commonly known as the toothed cattleya, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant produces a unique structure called a "catasetum," which is a specialized pollination organ that releases pollen in response to the touch of a pollinator. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This orchid is popular among horticulturists for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
