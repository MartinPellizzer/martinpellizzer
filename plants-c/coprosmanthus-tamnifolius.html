<p>Coprosmanthus tamnifolius, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a deciduous shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It features showy, orange-red bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, followed by capsule fruits that split open to release seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
