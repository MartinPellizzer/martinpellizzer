                    <h1>Cardamine acaulis</h1>
<p>Cardamine acaulis, commonly known as the barren-crown water-cress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to moist, calcareous habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp environments where it can thrive in partial shade. The plant has a short, upright stem with small, alternate, kidney-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are white or pale green, arranged in a single umbel, and are followed by small, elongated seed pods.</p>
<p>Cardamine acaulis is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its often toxic members, though this species is generally considered non-toxic and of minor ornamental value.</p>
