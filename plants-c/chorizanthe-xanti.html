<p>Chorizanthe xanti, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, leaf-like structures that serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
