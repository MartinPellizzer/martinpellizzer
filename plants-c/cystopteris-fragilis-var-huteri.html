                    <h1>Cystopteris fragilis var. huteri</h1>
<p>Cystopteris fragilis var. huteri, commonly known as the fragile water fern, is a variant of the brittle bladder fern.</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged fronds that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its fragile, papery fronds that easily break, giving it its common name.</p>
