                    <h1>Cotoneaster uniflorus</h1>
<p>Cotoneaster uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flowered cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hedge.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, flowers, and berries, though it is considered invasive in some regions.</p>
