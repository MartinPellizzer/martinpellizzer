                    <h1>Cardamine jamesonii var. goudotii</h1>
<p>Cardamine jamesonii var. goudotii, commonly known as the Goudot's watercress, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a peppery aroma, and small white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other members of the Ranzania genus within the Brassicaceae family.</p>
