                    <h1>Crepis × intermixta</h1>
<p>Crepis × intermixta, commonly known as the hybrid mouse-ear chickweed, is a perennial plant belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Crepis capillaris and Crepis vesicaria, exhibiting characteristics of both parents. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. It has basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in composite heads.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant hybridization and ecological adaptation.</p>
