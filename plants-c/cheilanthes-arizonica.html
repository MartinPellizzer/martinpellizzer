                    <h1>Cheilanthes arizonica</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that thrives in rocky, arid environments, often found on limestone or sandstone substrates. The plant has a distinctive, compact rosette of lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. It produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a characteristic feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique morphology, it is often used in xeriscaping and is considered an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
