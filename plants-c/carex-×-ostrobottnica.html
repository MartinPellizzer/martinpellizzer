                    <h1>Carex × ostrobottnica</h1>
<p>Carex × ostrobottnica, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Carex genus in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex remota and Carex sylvatica, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically forms dense clumps of grass-like leaves, with spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands, stream banks, and forest floors.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive mats, contributing to soil stabilization in wet habitats.</p>
