                    <h1>Cladium teretifolium var. tetraquetrum</h1>
<p>Cladium teretifolium var. tetraquetrum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant has a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in saturated soil conditions. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often hidden beneath the leaves, making it less showy than other grasses.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding and is an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
