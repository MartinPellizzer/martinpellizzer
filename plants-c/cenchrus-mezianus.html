                    <h1>Cenchrus mezianus</h1>
<p>Cenchrus mezianus, commonly known as the coastal grass or Mesian grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are adapted to thrive in saline and sandy soils. It is highly drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in its ability to prevent soil erosion and provide habitat for various coastal organisms.</p>
