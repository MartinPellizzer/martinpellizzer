<p>Calamagrostis arundinacea var. grandiflora, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, ornamental grass native to Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching stems that can grow up to 6 feet in height, with narrow, silver-green leaves. The plant produces showy, feathery panicles of pinkish-white flowers in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found near water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
