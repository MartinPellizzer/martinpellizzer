<p>Campanula molineri, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Campanula molineri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
