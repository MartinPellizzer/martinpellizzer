                    <h1>Carex caryophyllea f. subpolyrrhiza</h1>
<p>Carex caryophyllea f. subpolyrrhiza, commonly known as the woolly sedge, is a variant of the common sedge species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with a distinctive woolly texture on the leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of water bodies. It produces small, clustered spikelets that mature into brown, cylindrical structures, typical of the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats.</p>
