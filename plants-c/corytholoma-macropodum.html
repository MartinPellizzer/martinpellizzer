                    <h1>Corytholoma macropodum</h1>
<p>Corytholoma macropodum, commonly known as the giant puffball, is a unique fungal species that belongs to the family Lycoperdaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, white, spongy fruiting body that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The fungus is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in areas with decaying organic matter. Its spore-producing structure, called a volva, is enclosed within a thick, membranous layer that ruptures to release spores.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems.</p>
