                    <h1>Cuscuta inclusa</h1>
<p>Cuscuta inclusa, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true roots, leaves, and stems.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to host plants using haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found on crops such as corn and soybeans. Its life cycle is entirely dependent on its host, and it can significantly reduce the growth and yield of agricultural plants.</p>
<p>Cuscuta inclusa is widespread in North America and is considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
