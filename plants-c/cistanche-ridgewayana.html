                    <h1>Cistanche ridgewayana</h1>
<p>Cistanche ridgewayana, commonly known as the Chinese parasitic sage, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid regions of China.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on host plants for water and nutrients while conducting photosynthesis. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers and has a branched, fleshy stem that often grows in a creeping manner. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to its medicinal properties, it is also valued in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
