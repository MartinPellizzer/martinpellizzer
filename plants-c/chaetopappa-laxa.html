<p>Chaetopappa laxa, commonly known as the slenderleaf composite, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling shrub with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Chaetopappa laxa is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
