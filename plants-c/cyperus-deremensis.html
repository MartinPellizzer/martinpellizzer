                    <h1>Cyperus deremensis</h1>
<p>Cyperus deremensis, commonly known as the swamp cyperus, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, clustered flower heads that are often inconspicuous. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a tendency to form dense mats.</p>
<p>Cyperus deremensis is often considered an invasive species in non-native habitats due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas.</p>
