<p>Chorizanthe pungens var. diffusa, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, showy flowers. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, are pollinated by insects and birds, contributing to its ecological role in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
