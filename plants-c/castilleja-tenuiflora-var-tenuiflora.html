                    <h1>Castilleja tenuiflora var. tenuiflora</h1>
<p>Castilleja tenuiflora var. tenuiflora, commonly known as the narrowleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It has slender, reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis with its modified leaves. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its striking appearance makes it a popular subject in ecological and botanical studies.</p>
