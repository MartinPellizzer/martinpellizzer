<p>Crassina linearis, commonly known as the linear sea grass, is a marine flowering plant found in shallow coastal waters.</p>
<p>It has long, narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are adapted to withstand strong water currents. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by wind or water.
