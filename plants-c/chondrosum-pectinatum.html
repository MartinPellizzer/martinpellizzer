<p>Chondrosum pectinatum, commonly known as the pectinatum lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive thallus structure composed of a loosely aggregated cortex and a central medulla. The plant's surface is often covered with a layer of fine, white to yellowish powdery spores. It is typically found on bark, stone, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for air quality.</p>
