                    <h1>Caenopteris appendiculata</h1>
<p>Caenopteris appendiculata, commonly known as the appendiculate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates in its aquatic environment.</p>
<p>Caenopteris appendiculata plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
