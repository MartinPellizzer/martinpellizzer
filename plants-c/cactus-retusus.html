                    <h1>Cactus retusus</h1>
<p>Cactus retusus, commonly known as the hooked cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its stems are typically short and cylindrical, with prominent areoles from which both spines and flowers emerge.</p>
<p>Cactus retusus is well adapted to desert conditions, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water.</p>
