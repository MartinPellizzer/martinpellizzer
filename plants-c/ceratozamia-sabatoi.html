<p>Ceratozamia sabatoi, commonly known as the Sabato's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical rainforests of Mexico, specifically in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas. The plant is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. Its botanical features include a thick, fibrous root system and a unique reproductive structure known as a strobilus.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Ceratozamia sabatoi is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
