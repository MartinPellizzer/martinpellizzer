<p>Cheilanthes pellaeopsis, commonly known as the desert lip fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are well adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are typically arranged in a single row along the fronds. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in crevices or on limestone formations.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes pellaeopsis is a hardy, low-maintenance plant that is well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
