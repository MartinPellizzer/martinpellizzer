<p>Coptosapelta valetonii, commonly known as the Valeton's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pine-like leaves. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
