<p>Chamaepeuce wachtangia, commonly known as the Wachtangia lichen, is a unique plant belonging to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is a saxicolous lichen, meaning it grows on rock surfaces, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. The organism consists of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in harsh conditions. Its morphology includes a crust-like thallus that can be either foliose or crustose in structure.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
