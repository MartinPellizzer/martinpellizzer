                    <h1>Cycas saxatilis</h1>
<p>Cycas saxatilis, commonly known as the rock cycad, is a perennial plant native to southern China and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Cycas saxatilis is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in horticulture.</p>
