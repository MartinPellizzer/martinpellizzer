<p>Crataegus apiifolia, commonly known as the apple-leaved hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which resemble those of the apple tree, and its clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus apiifolia typically grows in moist woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year.</p>
