                    <h1>Cancellaria</h1>
<p>Cancellaria, commonly known as the sea snail or moon snail, is a genus of marine gastropod mollusks belonging to the family Cancellariidae.</p>
<p>These animals are characterized by their heavy, often spiral-shaped shells that are typically smooth or have faintly ridged surfaces. They are found in various marine environments, including coral reefs and sandy bottoms, where they feed on other mollusks and organic matter. Cancellaria species are known for their ability to bore into the shells of their prey using a radula, a specialized feeding structure.</p>
<p>Their presence in marine ecosystems contributes to the ecological balance by controlling populations of other invertebrates.</p>
