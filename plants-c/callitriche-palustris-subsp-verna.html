<p>Callitriche palustris subsp.</p>
<p>verna, commonly known as early marshwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant found in wetlands and slow-moving waters. It typically grows in dense mats, with slender, branching stems that are often submerged or partially emergent.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to nutrient-rich, freshwater environments and plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems.</p>
