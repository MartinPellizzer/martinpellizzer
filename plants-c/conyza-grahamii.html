<p>Conyza grahamii, commonly known as the desert fleabane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is an annual herb characterized by its narrow, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed areas and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Conyza grahamii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
