                    <h1>Chaerophyllum hirsutum var. glabrum</h1>
<p>Chaerophyllum hirsutum var. glabrum, commonly known as smooth hogweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are usually hairy but can become smooth in certain conditions, hence the variety name *glabrum*.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
