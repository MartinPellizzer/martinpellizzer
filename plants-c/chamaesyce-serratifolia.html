<p>Chamaesyce serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features hairy, succulent stems that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, serrated, and often covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Chamaesyce serratifolia is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in full sun conditions.</p>
