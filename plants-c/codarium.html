<p>Codarium, commonly known as the "garden orchid" or "Chinese evergreen," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers, which are often surrounded by a showy spathe. Codarium species are typically grown as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>They require well-draining soil and moderate watering to prevent root rot.</p>
