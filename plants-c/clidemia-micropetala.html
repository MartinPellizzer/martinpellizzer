                    <h1>Clidemia micropetala</h1>
<p>Clidemia micropetala, commonly known as the small-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Onagraceae family and typically grows on the branches of other trees, drawing water and nutrients from its host. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically white or pale green with four petals. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host tree.</p>
