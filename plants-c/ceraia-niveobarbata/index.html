                            <h1>Ceraia Niveobarbata</h1>
<p>White-barred ceria, scientifically known as Ceraia niveobarbata, is a strikingly beautiful freshwater snail native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. This species is easily identifiable by its distinctive white stripes that run across its shell, creating a unique and elegant appearance. It thrives in slow-moving streams and ponds, where it plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological significance, the white-barred ceria has become a subject of interest for both researchers and aquarium enthusiasts. Conservation efforts are increasingly important to protect this species from habitat degradation and over-collection.</p>
