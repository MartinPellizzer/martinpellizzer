<p>Coronanthera grandis, commonly known as the giant coronanthera, is a striking orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces strikingly colored, waxy petals that range from white to pink, often with a contrasting lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
