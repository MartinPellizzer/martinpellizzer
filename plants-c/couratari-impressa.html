<p>Couratari impressa, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree or *Schinus terebinthifolius*, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are opposite and have a distinctive, slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various birds and mammals. Its bark is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
