                    <h1>Copisma tottum</h1>
<p>Copisma tottum, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to excrete salt through specialized structures called salt glands. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds into the tidal waters, facilitating its dispersal in coastal ecosystems.</p>
