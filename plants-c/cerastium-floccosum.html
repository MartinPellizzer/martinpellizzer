                    <h1>Cerastium floccosum</h1>
<p>Cerastium floccosum, commonly known as snowflat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its often rocky or sandy habitats. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are visited by various pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Cerastium floccosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
