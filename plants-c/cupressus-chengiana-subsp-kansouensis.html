<p>Cupressus chengiana subsp.</p>
<p>kansouensis, commonly known as the Kansouensis Chinese Fir, is a rare and ornamental conifer native to China. It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and dense, scale-like foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance.</p>

<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is highly valued in horticulture and botanical conservation efforts.</p>
