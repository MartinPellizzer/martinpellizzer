                    <h1>Ctenodon histrix var. densiflorus</h1>
<p>Ctenodon histrix var. densiflorus, commonly known as the dense-flowered ctenodon, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the ctenodon genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact inflorescences and small, clustered flowers, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous blooms that are often overlooked.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
