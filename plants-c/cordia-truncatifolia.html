<p>Cordia truncatifolia, commonly known as the African sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically 10â€“20 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
