                    <h1>Cuscuta chinensis var. trigyna</h1>
<p>Cuscuta chinensis var. trigyna, commonly known as Chinese dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to East Asia and can be found growing on a variety of plants, including crops and ornamental species. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
