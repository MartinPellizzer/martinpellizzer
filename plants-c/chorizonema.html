                    <h1>Chorizonema</h1>
<p>Chorizonema, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. Chorizonema species are typically shrubs or small trees with thick, waxy leaves adapted to conserve water.</p>
<p>They play an important role in desert ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small animals.</p>
