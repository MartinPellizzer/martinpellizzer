                    <h1>Cuscuta goyaziana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta goyaziana, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants to extract water and nutrients. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is often found on crops such as soybeans and cotton. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means, allowing it to spread easily.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
