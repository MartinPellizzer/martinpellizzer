<p>Critho aegiceras, commonly known as the mangrove apple or sea apple, is a halophytic shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests and estuaries. The plant has woody stems and produces small, white flowers that are followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. Its leaves are alternate and elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Critho aegiceras plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
