                    <h1>Cystochilum</h1>
<p>Cystochilum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in swampy areas. Cystochilum has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
