                    <h1>Chondrorhyncha lipscombiae</h1>
<p>Chondrorhyncha lipscombiae, commonly known as the Lipscomb's coralroot, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in a raceme, typically blooming in late spring. Its roots are specialized for forming symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which provide the necessary nutrients for survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
