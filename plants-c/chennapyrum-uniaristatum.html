                    <h1>Chennapyrum uniaristatum</h1>
<p>Chennapyrum uniaristatum, commonly known as the single-armed chennapyrum, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its singular, elongated stem.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Chenopodiaceae family and is native to specific arid regions where it thrives in saline soils. The plant exhibits a distinctive morphology with small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting to its harsh environment. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research.</p>
