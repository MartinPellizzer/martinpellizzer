<p>Cousinia cymbolepis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, such as meadows and slopes, and is adapted to withstand dry conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Cousinia cymbolepis plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions.</p>
