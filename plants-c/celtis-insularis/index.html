                            <h1>Celtis Insularis</h1>
<p>Celtis insularis is a rare and unique plant species found primarily on certain remote islands. It belongs to the Cannabaceae family and is known for its distinctive leaf shape and small, edible fruits. This plant thrives in specific microhabitats, often in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts. Studying Celtis insularis offers insights into ecological adaptation and biodiversity in isolated ecosystems.</p>
