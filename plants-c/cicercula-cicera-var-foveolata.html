It is native to certain regions of southern Africa, where it typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant morphology and adaptation to extreme environments.</p>
