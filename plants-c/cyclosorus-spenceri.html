                    <h1>Cyclosorus spenceri</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus spenceri, commonly known as the Spencer's cyclosorus, is a rare and delicate fern native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that form a compact, low-growing rosette. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments with high humidity, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Its spores are dispersed through wind, and the plant reproduces primarily through spore propagation rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Cyclosorus spenceri is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
