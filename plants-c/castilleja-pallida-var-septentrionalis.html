<p>Castilleja pallida var. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern pale castilleja, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on the roots of other plants for some of its nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to the western United States, particularly in regions with dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant has slender, often reddish stems and small, clustered leaves, and its flowers are typically pale yellow to orange-red. It produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with grasses and shrubs.</p>
