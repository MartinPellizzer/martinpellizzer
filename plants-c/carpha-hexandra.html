                    <h1>Carpha hexandra</h1>
<p>Carpha hexandra, commonly known as the slender flat sedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, and it thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Carpha hexandra is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its botanical significance lies in its ecological role within wetland ecosystems.</p>
