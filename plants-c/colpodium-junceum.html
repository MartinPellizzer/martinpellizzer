                    <h1>Colpodium junceum</h1>
<p>Colpodium junceum, commonly known as slender basketgrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Colpodium junceum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
