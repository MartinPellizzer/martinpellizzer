<p>Crassipes, commonly known as water hyacinth, is an aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It has floating leaves that are broad and arrow-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps it stay buoyant. The plant produces showy purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling those of true hyacinths. Water hyacinth spreads rapidly through vegetative reproduction, forming dense mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in many regions, impacting water quality and aquatic ecosystems.</p>
