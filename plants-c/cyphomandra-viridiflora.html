<p>Cyphomandra viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are typically orange or yellow when ripe, though they are often bitter and require processing before consumption. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal regions.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity in raw form, it is important to handle and prepare the plant with care.</p>
