<p>Crossopteryx, commonly known as the flame of the forest, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lythraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Indian subcontinent and is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom profusely during the dry season. The plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as scrublands and forest margins. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
