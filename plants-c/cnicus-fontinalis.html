<p>Cnicus fontinalis, commonly known as water cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant has compound leaves with five leaflets, and its flowers are bright yellow, with five petals. It produces small, oval berries that are edible but not particularly palatable.</p>
<p>Water cinquefoil is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments.</p>
