                    <h1>Carex binervis var. alpina</h1>
<p>Carex binervis var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often ribbed, and it produces small, clustered spikes of greenish flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in cold climates and high altitudes.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from the typical Carex binervis by its more compact growth habit and specific ecological adaptations.</p>
