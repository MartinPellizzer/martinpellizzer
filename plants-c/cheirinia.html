                    <h1>Cheirinia</h1>
<p>Cheirinia, commonly known as the "false hellebore," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae.</p>
<p>It comprises several species, most of which are herbaceous perennials native to Europe and western Asia. The plants typically have basal leaves that are palmately divided, and their flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with five to eight sepals and petals. Cheirinia species are often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>However, they are generally not widely cultivated due to their limited ornamental value and potential toxicity.</p>
