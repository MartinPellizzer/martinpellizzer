<p>Caladenia remota subsp.</p>
<p>parva, commonly known as the small ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils within open habitats, often in areas with low rainfall. Its flowers are usually less than 2 cm in diameter, with intricate petal structures that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
