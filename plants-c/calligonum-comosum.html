<p>Calligonum comosum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically small and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Calligonum comosum is also valued for its ability to stabilize sand dunes and prevent soil erosion.</p>
