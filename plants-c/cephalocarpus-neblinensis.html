                    <h1>Cephalocarpus neblinensis</h1>
<p>Cephalocarpus neblinensis, commonly known as the misty-headed plant, is a unique species native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, helmet-shaped fruiting bodies that give it its scientific name. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with dense foliage, often forming a low shrub. Its leaves are typically small,革质 (leathery), and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unusual morphology and potential ecological role in its ecosystem.</p>
