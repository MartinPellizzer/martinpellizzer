                    <h1>Colysis fluviatilis</h1>
<p>Colysis fluviatilis, commonly known as the river colysis, is a rare aquatic plant found in slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It has finely divided, feather-like leaves that help it float and absorb nutrients from the water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in nutrient-rich, muddy substrates along riverbanks and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecosystem health.</p>
