                    <h1>Calliandra eriophylla var. eriophylla</h1>
<p>Calliandra eriophylla var. eriophylla, commonly known as the silky calliandra, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, pink to red bracts that are often mistaken for flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, adding visual interest to the foliage. Its leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small leaflets that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance.</p>
<p>This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils with full sun.</p>
