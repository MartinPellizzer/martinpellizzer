<p>Capsella bursa-pastoris lutetiana, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, white flowers and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, round seed pods that resemble a shepherd's purse, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in many regions.</p>
