<p>Campyloneurum sieberianum, commonly known as the Sieber's clubmoss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Huperjiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest floors or on rocky substrates. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, develop from the base of the leafy shoots and produce spores for dispersal.</p>
<p>Campyloneurum sieberianum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
