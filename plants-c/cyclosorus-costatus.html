<p>Cyclosorus costatus, commonly known as the serrated water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often serrated along the edges. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the substrate, helping to stabilize the soil.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus costatus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
