                    <h1>Ceratozamia × katzeriana</h1>
<p>Ceratozamia × katzeriana, commonly known as the hybrid cycad, is a rare and unique plant resulting from the cross between Ceratozamia magnifica and Zamioculcas zamiifolia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant is native to southern Africa and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage. It is slow-growing and requires well-drained soil and minimal water, making it suitable for indoor or greenhouse cultivation.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is important to note that cycads, including this hybrid, are considered living fossils and have significant ecological and evolutionary importance.</p>
