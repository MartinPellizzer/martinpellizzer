                    <h1>Cousinia allolepis</h1>
<p>Cousinia allolepis, commonly known as the sand couchgrass, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has a low, spreading growth habit with dense, fibrous roots that help it survive in sandy and saline soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Cousinia allolepis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is often found in steppe and desert ecosystems.</p>
