                    <h1>Cymatocarpus heterophyllus</h1>
<p>Cymatocarpus heterophyllus, commonly known as the giant water chestnut, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has a robust, rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread rapidly in wetland environments. The plant features broad, floating leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, providing shade and habitat for aquatic life. Its distinctive, spiky seed pods develop underwater and can float to the surface once mature.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
