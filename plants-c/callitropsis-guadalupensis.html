                    <h1>Callitropsis guadalupensis</h1>
<p>Callitropsis guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupe fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of the Guadalupe Mountains in Texas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in spirals. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the local ecosystem and a subject of conservation interest.</p>
