                            <h1>Corallodendron Divaricatum</h1>
<p>Tropical coral tree, scientifically known as Corallodendron divaricatum, is a striking ornamental plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. This species is prized for its vibrant, coral-like flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The tree's unique appearance, with its slender branches and delicate blooms, makes it a popular choice for tropical gardens and landscapes. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to flourish. Despite its beauty, the tropical coral tree is relatively rare in cultivation, making it a sought-after specimen among plant enthusiasts.</p>
