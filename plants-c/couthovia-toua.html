                    <h1>Couthovia toua</h1>
<p>Couthovia toua, commonly known as the Tua's Ghost Orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species found in the remote highlands of Tua.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white petals and a delicate, elongated spur that resembles a ghostly appendage. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, typically growing on decaying wood or in mossy crevices. Its flowers bloom only once every few years, making it a rare sight in the wild.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Couthovia toua is considered critically endangered.</p>
