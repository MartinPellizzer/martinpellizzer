                    <h1>Cassytha americana var. brachystachya</h1>
<p>Cassytha americana var. brachystachya, commonly known as the short-stemmed dodder, is a parasitic vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and is often found in wetland habitats. Its stems are slender and twining, allowing it to spread along the surface of water or among vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
