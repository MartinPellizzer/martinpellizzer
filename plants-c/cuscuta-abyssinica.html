                    <h1>Cuscuta abyssinica</h1>
<p>Cuscuta abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks leaves, stems, and roots.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to host plants using specialized haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract nutrients. This species is native to Africa and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its small, yellowish flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces tiny, dry fruits that contain its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken or even kill its host plants.</p>
