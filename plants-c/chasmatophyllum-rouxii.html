<p>Chasmatophyllum rouxii, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a rare and striking plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant produces striking violet-blue berries that contain toxic compounds, making it a cautionary example of botanical defense mechanisms. Its unique floral morphology and nocturnal blooming habits make it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
