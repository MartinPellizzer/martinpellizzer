<p>Chionochloa flavescens subsp.</p>
<p>flavescens, commonly known as the yellow mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and bright yellow inflorescences that bloom in the summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a silver-gray sheen that helps reflect sunlight in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas.</p>
