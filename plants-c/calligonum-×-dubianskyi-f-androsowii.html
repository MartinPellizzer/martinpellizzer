                    <h1>Calligonum × dubianskyi f. androsowii</h1>
<p>Calligonum × dubianskyi f. androsowii, commonly known as the hybrid saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Calligonum elongatum and Calligonum dasycladum. The plant is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, scale-like leaves adapted to reduce water loss. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for soil stabilization in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate extreme drought and high salinity contributes to its ecological significance in desert ecosystems.</p>
