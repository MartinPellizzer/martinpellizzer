                    <h1>Crucihimalaya tibetica</h1>
<p>Crucihimalaya tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan crucihimalaya, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its upright stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions.</p>
