                    <h1>Cynanchum undulatum</h1>
<p>Cynanchum undulatum, commonly known as the undulating milkweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicles containing toxic, milky sap. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic compounds, it is not typically used in traditional medicine but is of interest to botanists and ecologists.</p>
