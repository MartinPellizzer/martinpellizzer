<p>Cyanospermum albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered blue spirillum, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its striking blue pigmentation and delicate white flowers.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and ponds, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant's leaves are small and spiral-shaped, contributing to its common name, while its flowers bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value. Cyanospermum albiflorum is notable for its ability to produce a bioactive compound that has attracted interest in pharmaceutical research.</p>
<p>However, its ecological role and distribution remain understudied, limiting its recognition in botanical literature.</p>
