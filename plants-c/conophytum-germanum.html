<p>Conophytum germanum, commonly known as the German dwarf cholla, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant features small, spiky leaves that are typically covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss. It produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Conophytum germanum is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
