The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers with a unique, elongated spur that houses the pollinia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Catasetum proboscideum is known for its specialized pollination mechanism, which involves the transfer of pollinia via a pollinator's body.</p>
