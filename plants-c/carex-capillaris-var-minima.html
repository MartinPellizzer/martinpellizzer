<p>Carex capillaris var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist, temperate regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer, adding subtle ornamental value. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires consistently moist soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ability to stabilize soil, it is often used in wetland restoration and garden landscaping.</p>
