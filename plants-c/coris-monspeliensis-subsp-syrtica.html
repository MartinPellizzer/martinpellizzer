<p>Coris monspeliensis subsp.</p>
<p>syrtica, commonly known as the Syrtic sand verbena, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom during the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
