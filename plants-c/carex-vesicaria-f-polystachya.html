The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a rhizomatous growth habit.</p>
<p>This form is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
