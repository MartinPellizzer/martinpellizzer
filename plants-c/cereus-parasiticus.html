                    <h1>Cereus parasiticus</h1>
<p>Cereus parasiticus, commonly known as the parasitic night-blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from its host plant while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has a tall, spiny stem and produces large, showy white flowers that open at night. Its flowers emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming behavior.</p>
