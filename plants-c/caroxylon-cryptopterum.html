                    <h1>Caroxylon cryptopterum</h1>
<p>Caroxylon cryptopterum, commonly known as the cryptopterum cycad, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, needle-like leaves that give it a prehistoric appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its endangered status, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
