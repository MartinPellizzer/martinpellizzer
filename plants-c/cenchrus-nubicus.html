                    <h1>Cenchrus nubicus</h1>
<p>Cenchrus nubicus, commonly known as the desert grass or sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, wiry leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Cenchrus nubicus is often found in sandy soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it an important component of desert ecosystems and a potential forage plant for livestock in certain regions.</p>
