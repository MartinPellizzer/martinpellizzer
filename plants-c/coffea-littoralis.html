                    <h1>Coffea littoralis</h1>
<p>Coffea littoralis, commonly known as the coastal coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly along the coastal areas of East Africa. The plant produces small, oval-shaped berries that contain two seeds, which are used to make coffee. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less commercially significant coffee species compared to Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora.</p>
