                    <h1>Corylus avellana var. lacerata</h1>
<p>Corylus avellana var. lacerata, commonly known as the curly hazel, is a variant of the common hazel that is characterized by its uniquely frayed and shredded leaves.</p>
<p>This ornamental plant is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its distinctive foliage rather than its edible nuts. The leaves are typically pale green with a white or silver underside, creating a striking visual contrast. It produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring followed by edible hazelnuts in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
