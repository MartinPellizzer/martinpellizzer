                    <h1>Chelonistele perakensis</h1>
<p>Chelonistele perakensis, commonly known as the Perak mountain fern, is a rare tropical plant native to the rainforests of Malaysia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in the canopy of dense forests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its leaves, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
