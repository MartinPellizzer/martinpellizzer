                    <h1>Coriaria atropurpurea</h1>
<p>Coriaria atropurpurea, commonly known as purple coralroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Coriariaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces small, pinkish to purple flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported antispasmodic and analgesic properties.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
