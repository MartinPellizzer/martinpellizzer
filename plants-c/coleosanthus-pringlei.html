<p>Coleosanthus pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with translucent, waxy leaves and delicate, pale green or white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches in temperate rainforests. It is a terrestrial orchid with a short, tuberous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
