                    <h1>Corchorus merxmuelleri</h1>
<p>Corchorus merxmuelleri, commonly known as the desert cotton or Mexican broomrape, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants such as cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its lack of true leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its stems and flowers. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptation to harsh environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems.</p>
