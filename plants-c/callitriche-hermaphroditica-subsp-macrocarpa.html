                    <h1>Callitriche hermaphroditica subsp. macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Callitriche hermaphroditica subsp.</p>
<p>macrocarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its floating leaves, which are typically oval or ovate in shape and have a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are borne in clusters, and it is monoecious, meaning it has both male and female reproductive structures on the same individual. Its fruits are distinctive, being large and berry-like, which aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in still or slow-moving waters, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
