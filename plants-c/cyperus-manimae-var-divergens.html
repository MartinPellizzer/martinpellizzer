<p>Cyperus manimae var. divergens, commonly known as the Manimae flatsedge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered spikelets that are often surrounded by bracts, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its divergent leaf arrangement, which sets it apart from other members of the Cyperus genus.</p>
