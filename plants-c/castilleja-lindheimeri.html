<p>Castilleja lindheimeri, commonly known as Lindheimer's paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red-orange to yellow flower clusters that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for water and nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Castilleja lindheimeri plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar to pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
