                    <h1>Chondropetalum tectorum</h1>
<p>Chondropetalum tectorum, commonly known as the rock sparrow's nest, is a unique fern species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, clustered fronds. The plant thrives in rocky, alpine environments, often growing in crevices and on steep slopes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
