                    <h1>Cornus canadensis f. virescens</h1>
<p>Cornus canadensis f. virescens, commonly known as the green-leafed cornel, is a rare and distinctive variant of the cornel dogwood.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, dark green foliage that contrasts with its typical white or pink bracts. This plant is a low-growing perennial, often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its small, white flowers appear in early spring, followed by red or purple berries in the fall.</p>
<p>The foliage coloration of this form is a notable botanical feature that sets it apart from other members of the Cornus genus.</p>
