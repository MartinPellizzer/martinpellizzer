<p>Cousinia lindbergii, commonly known as Lindberg's cushion flower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
