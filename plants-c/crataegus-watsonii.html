<p>Crataegus watsonii, commonly known as Watson's hawthorn, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the southwestern United States, particularly Arizona and New Mexico, where it thrives in rocky soils and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Crataegus watsonii plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects, by providing food and habitat.</p>
