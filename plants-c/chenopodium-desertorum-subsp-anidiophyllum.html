<p>Chenopodium desertorum subsp.</p>
<p>anidiophyllum, commonly known as desert goosefoot, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It typically has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in desert ecosystems.</p>
