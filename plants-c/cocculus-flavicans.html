                    <h1>Cocculus flavicans</h1>
<p>Cocculus flavicans, commonly known as the yellow bittersweet, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that develop into bright orange, fleshy berries. The plant contains toxic compounds, including bufotenin and other tropane alkaloids, which have been used in traditional medicine. Its berries are a food source for certain birds and mammals, contributing to seed dispersal.</p>
<p>The plant's rapid growth and ornamental qualities make it both a popular garden plant and a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
