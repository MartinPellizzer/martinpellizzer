                    <h1>Cohniella × carbonoi</h1>
<p>Cohniella × carbonoi, commonly known as the hybrid cactus, is a unique plant species that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, typically a cactus and a related succulent.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant features spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers are often showy, with vibrant colors that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, Cohniella × carbonoi is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes.</p>
