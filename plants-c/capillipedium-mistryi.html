<p>Capillipedium mistryi, commonly known as the Mistry's capillary moss, is a rare and specialized member of the moss family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like structures that form dense, carpet-like growths on rocky substrates. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with elongated, branching filaments that contribute to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high moisture levels.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Capillipedium mistryi is considered a conservation concern.</p>
