                    <h1>Chlamysporum arbusculum</h1>
<p>Chlamysporum arbusculum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its root system consists of specialized structures called mycorrhizae, which form symbiotic relationships with fungi to absorb nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a threatened species.</p>
