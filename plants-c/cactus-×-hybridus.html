                    <h1>Cactus × hybridus</h1>
<p>Cactus × hybridus, commonly known as the hybrid cactus, is a naturally occurring hybrid between different cactus species, often resulting from cross-pollination.</p>
<p>It typically exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, such as varied spination, coloration, and growth forms. These hybrids are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their unique appearance and ability to thrive in arid conditions. They possess succulent stems that store water, allowing them to survive in dry environments.</p>
<p>However, their hybrid nature can make them less hardy than their parent species, requiring careful cultivation.</p>
