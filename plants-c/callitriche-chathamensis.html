<p>Callitriche chathamensis, commonly known as the Chatham Island water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the Chatham Islands of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it thrives in still or slow-moving water. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are usually oval or ovate in shape, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often appearing in clusters, and it reproduces both sexually through seeds and asexually through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region.</p>
