                    <h1>Cuscuta camelorum</h1>
<p>Cuscuta camelorum, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique ability to attach itself to a variety of host plants, including shrubs and trees. The plant's stems are covered in tiny, hooked structures that allow it to grip and extract nutrients from its host. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it thrives in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken or even kill its host plants.</p>
