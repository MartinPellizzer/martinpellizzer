<p>Crypsinopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a type of orchid that lacks leaves and relies entirely on its roots for sustenance, making it highly specialized. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in specific wetland habitats, often growing on the trunks of trees or in swampy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat requirements, Crypsinopsis is considered an endangered species.</p>
