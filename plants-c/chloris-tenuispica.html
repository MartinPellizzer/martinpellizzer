<p>Chloris tenuispica, commonly known as slender spike grass, is a small, tufted grass species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale blue or white flowers.
