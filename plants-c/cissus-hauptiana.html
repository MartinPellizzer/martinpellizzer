                    <h1>Cissus hauptiana</h1>
<p>Cissus hauptiana, commonly known as the climbing cissus, is a tropical vine native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red fruits that are edible but tart. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Cissus hauptiana is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover in shaded gardens.</p>
