                    <h1>Cladomyza gracilis</h1>
<p>Cladomyza gracilis, commonly known as the slender lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a unique symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocks, bark, or soil in temperate and arctic regions, forming a crust-like or foliose structure. The plant's thallus is usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. Cladomyza gracilis is known for its ability to survive in harsh environments due to its slow growth and resistance to desiccation.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat.</p>
