                    <h1>Cassytha dispar</h1>
<p>Cassytha dispar, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic vine native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through haustoria that attach to the stems of its host plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is often found growing on a variety of hosts, including shrubs and trees. Its stems are usually yellow or green and can become woody as the plant matures.</p>
<p>Cassytha dispar plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant growth and providing food for certain insects and animals.</p>
