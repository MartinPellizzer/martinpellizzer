                            <h1>Clarkia Heterandra</h1>
<p>Clarkia heterandra is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is known for its vibrant, showy blooms that range in color from pink to red, making it a popular choice for gardeners and botanists alike. This species belongs to the Onagraceae family, which includes other well-known plants like the evening primrose. Its unique, spurred petals and delicate structure set it apart from many other flowering plants. Despite its beauty, Clarkia heterandra is also a valuable species for ecological studies due to its specific habitat requirements and role in local pollination networks.</p>
