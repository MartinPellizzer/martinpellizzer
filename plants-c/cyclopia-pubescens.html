                    <h1>Cyclopia pubescens</h1>
<p>Cyclopia pubescens, commonly known as the Cape sugarbush, is a shrub native to the fynbos biome of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is drought-resistant, making it well-suited to the Mediterranean climate of its native region. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Cyclopia pubescens plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is also valued for its medicinal properties.</p>
