                    <h1>Centaurea longispina</h1>
<p>Centaurea longispina, commonly known as the long-spined centaurea, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across rocky and dry habitats. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Centaurea longispina is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
