                    <h1>Cardamine arenosa</h1>
<p>Cardamine arenosa, commonly known as sand watercress, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Cardamine arenosa is adapted to survive in dry, nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient species in harsh environments.</p>
