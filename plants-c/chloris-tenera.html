                    <h1>Chloris tenera</h1>
<p>Chloris tenera, commonly known as slender grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Australia.</p>
<p>It features fine, narrow leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in spring. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for dryland environments. Its compact growth habit and ability to form dense mats make it useful for erosion control and ground cover.</p>
<p>Chloris tenera is often found in grasslands and open woodlands, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats.</p>
