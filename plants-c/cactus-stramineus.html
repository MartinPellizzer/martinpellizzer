                    <h1>Cactus stramineus</h1>
<p>Cactus stramineus, commonly known as the white cactus or the woolly cactus, is a species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. Its roots are shallow and widespread, allowing it to quickly absorb rainwater during brief rainfall events.</p>
<p>Cactus stramineus is well adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with minimal water and nutrients.</p>
