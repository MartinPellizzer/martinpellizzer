                    <h1>Cephalophyllum albertiniense</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum albertiniense, commonly known as the Albertine headplant, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, specifically Namibia and Angola. The plant is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped stems that are often covered in dense, woolly hair. Its flowers, which appear in spring, are typically yellow or orange and are borne at the tips of the stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
