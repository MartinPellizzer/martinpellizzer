                    <h1>Cephalosphaera usambarensis</h1>
<p>Cephalosphaera usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambara shield fern, is a unique member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Native to the montane forests of East Africa, particularly Tanzania, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, with sori that are clustered and protected by a thin, membranous indusium.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
