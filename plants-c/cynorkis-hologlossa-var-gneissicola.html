<p>Cynorkis hologlossa var. gneissicola, commonly known as the Gneissicola orchid, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in rocky, nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, strap-like leaves and delicate, often fragrant flowers. The species thrives in high-altitude regions with cool, moist conditions, typically found in mountainous areas of South America. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
