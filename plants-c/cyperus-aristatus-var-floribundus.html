                    <h1>Cyperus aristatus var. floribundus</h1>
<p>Cyperus aristatus var. floribundus, commonly known as the purple rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features dense, grass-like foliage with slender, erect stems that often produce clusters of small, purplish flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a useful wetland indicator and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
<p>The plant's ornamental value is enhanced by its striking purple inflorescences, which appear in late summer to early autumn.</p>
