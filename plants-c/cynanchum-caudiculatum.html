                    <h1>Cynanchum caudiculatum</h1>
<p>Cynanchum caudiculatum, commonly known as the spiny milkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of central and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, cylindrical stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
