                    <h1>Cyperus nanus</h1>
<p>Cyperus nanus, commonly known as dwarf sedges, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters, with slender, grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters. The plant thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, ponds, or along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Cyperus nanus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in water gardens or as a pond plant.</p>
