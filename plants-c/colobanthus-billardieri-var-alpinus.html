                    <h1>Colobanthus billardieri var. alpinus</h1>
<p>Colobanthus billardieri var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine pearlwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high elevations or in rockeries.</p>
