                    <h1>Colchicum latifolium</h1>
<p>Colchicum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces large, waxy leaves that are typically broad and lance-shaped, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain colchicine, a potent alkaloid.</p>
