<p>Cenchrus beckeroides, commonly known as the Becker's lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a resilient species in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Cenchrus beckeroides is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
