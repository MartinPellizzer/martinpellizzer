<p>Calorophus densus, commonly known as the dense flamebush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its thick foliage provides habitat for various small animals and insects.</p>
<p>Calorophus densus is well adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can withstand periods of drought.</p>
