<p>Cremanthodium cymosum, commonly known as the clustered flaxflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers, which bloom in the summer, are often pink or purple, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
