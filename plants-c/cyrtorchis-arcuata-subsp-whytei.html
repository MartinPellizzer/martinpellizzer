<p>Cyrtorchis arcuata subsp.</p>
<p>whytei, commonly known as the Whyte's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale green to white, strap-like leaves and its distinctive, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as pine flatwoods and scrub habitats. Its flowers, which are usually pale green or white with a slight pinkish tinge, bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
