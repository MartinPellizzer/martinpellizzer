                    <h1>Cerastium alpinum var. villosum</h1>
<p>Cerastium alpinum var. villosum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions.</p>
