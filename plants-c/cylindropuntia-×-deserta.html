                    <h1>Cylindropuntia × deserta</h1>
<p>Cylindropuntia × deserta, commonly known as the desert nightshade or fishhook cactus, is a hybrid species native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its spines are modified leaves, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Cylindropuntia × deserta is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems and performing photosynthesis through its spines.</p>
