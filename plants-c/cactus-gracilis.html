                    <h1>Cactus gracilis</h1>
<p>Cactus gracilis, commonly known as the slender cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny stems that store water efficiently, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a delicate touch of color to its otherwise desolate habitat. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Cactus gracilis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to withstand extreme temperatures.</p>
