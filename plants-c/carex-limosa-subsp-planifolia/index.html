                            <h1>Carex Limosa Subsp. Planifolia</h1>
<p>Carex limosa subsp. planifolia is a lesser-known member of the sedge family known for its unique morphology and ecological significance. This subspecies is characterized by its flat, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, making it easily distinguishable from other Carex species. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds and lakes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable indicator species for wetland health. Despite its ecological importance, it remains under-studied and warrants further conservation attention.</p>
