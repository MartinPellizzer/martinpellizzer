                    <h1>Corylus avellana var. serenyiana</h1>
<p>Corylus avellana var. serenyiana, commonly known as the Serenyiana hazelnut, is a rare variant of the common hazel.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring elongated, serrated leaves that distinguish it from typical hazel species. The plant produces small, oval nuts enclosed in a cupule, which is typically hairy and persistent. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or moist soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically valuable species.</p>
