                    <h1>Cristaria glaucophylla var. eriantha</h1>
<p>Cristaria glaucophylla var. eriantha, commonly known as the silver-leafed crista, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, feather-like leaves that are covered in a waxy, silver coating, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
