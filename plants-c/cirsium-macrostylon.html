                    <h1>Cirsium macrostylon</h1>
<p>Cirsium macrostylon, commonly known as the tall thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has deeply lobed, silvery-green leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for anchoring in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Cirsium macrostylon plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
