<p>Campanula scheuchzeri subf.</p>
<p>hirtescens, commonly known as the hairy bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It features upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and also covered in a dense layer of hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This sub-species is adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, thriving in environments with full sun and low moisture.</p>
