                    <h1>Cuscuta coriariae</h1>
<p>Cuscuta coriariae, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of slender, thread-like stems. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize a wide range of host species. It is often found on agricultural crops and wild plants, causing damage by draining resources from its hosts.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
