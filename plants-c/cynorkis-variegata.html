                    <h1>Cynorkis variegata</h1>
<p>Cynorkis variegata, commonly known as the variegated cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white markings. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in warm, sunny environments with well-draining soil and is relatively slow-growing.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
