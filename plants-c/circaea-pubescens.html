                    <h1>Circaea pubescens</h1>
<p>Circaea pubescens, commonly known as the white geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its hairy texture, with "pubescens" meaning "covered in hair" in Latin.</p>
