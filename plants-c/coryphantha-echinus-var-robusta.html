                    <h1>Coryphantha echinus var. robusta</h1>
<p>Coryphantha echinus var. robusta, commonly known as the robust hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are typically green with a reddish tinge. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to desert environments.</p>
<p>The varietal name 'robusta' reflects its robust growth and thick, fleshy stems compared to other varieties of Coryphantha.</p>
