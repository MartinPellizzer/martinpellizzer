<p>Cyperus subumbellatus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, cylindrical flower spikes. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often near water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Cyperus subumbellatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
