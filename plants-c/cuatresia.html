                    <h1>Cuatresia</h1>
<p>Cuatresia, commonly known as the "flower of the sea," is a rare and unique plant found in specific coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline environments, showcasing adaptations to high salt concentrations and strong tidal influences. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a delicate, almost translucent appearance. The plant's roots are specialized to filter out excess salt, allowing it to survive in harsh maritime conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, Cuatresia is considered an important indicator of coastal ecosystem health.</p>
