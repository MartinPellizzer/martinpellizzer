                    <h1>Chamaerops humilis var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Chamaerops humilis var. gracilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved date palm, is a compact, cold-hardy palm native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching fronds that give it a graceful, fountain-like appearance. The plant produces small, edible dates, though it is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for small gardens or container planting.</p>
