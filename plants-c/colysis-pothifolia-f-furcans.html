                    <h1>Colysis pothifolia f. furcans</h1>
<p>Colysis pothifolia f. furcans, commonly known as the forked leaf tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that often split into two at the base, giving it the "forked" appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
