<p>Cerastium glutinosum var. gracillimum, commonly known as sticky willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in soft, sticky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a fine layer of sticky secretions.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more delicate appearance compared to the typical form of Cerastium glutinosum.</p>
