<p>Calamagrostis heterophylla, commonly known as the variable reedgrass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fine, grass-like leaves that vary in width along the stem, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering spikes are usually slender and appear in late summer, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Calamagrostis heterophylla is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
