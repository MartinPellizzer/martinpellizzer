                    <h1>Cynometra escherichii</h1>
<p>Cynometra escherichii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its hard, dense wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland and savanna habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited seed dispersal, it is considered a threatened species in some regions.</p>
