<p>Carex vaginata var. curvirostra, commonly known as the curled-sheath sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense, tussock-like clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically found in the axils of the leaves. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
