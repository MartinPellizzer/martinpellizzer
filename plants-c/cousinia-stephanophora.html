<p>Cousinia stephanophora, commonly known as the steppe cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically silver-gray, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cousinia stephanophora is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of steppe and desert ecosystems.</p>
