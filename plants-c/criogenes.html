                    <h1>Criogenes</h1>
<p>Criogenes, commonly known as the "ice plant," is a succulent species native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves and its ability to survive extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the rainy season, which attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its scientific name is *Aptenia cordifolia*, and it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Criogenes has adapted to store water in its leaves, allowing it to thrive in environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
