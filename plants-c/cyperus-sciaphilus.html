                    <h1>Cyperus sciaphilus</h1>
<p>Cyperus sciaphilus, commonly known as the shade-loving sedge, is a perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands, where it forms dense clumps of grass-like foliage. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically dark green, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Cyperus sciaphilus is often used in landscaping for its ability to tolerate low light and wet conditions.</p>
