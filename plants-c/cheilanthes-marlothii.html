<p>Cheilanthes marlothii, commonly known as the Marloth's rockcap, is a species of fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found growing on rocky outcrops or in dry, sunny environments. The plant has thick, leathery fronds that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are often covered in a layer of fine, hairy structures.</p>
