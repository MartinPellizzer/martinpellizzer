<p>Crassula zombensis, commonly known as the Zombie Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the warmer months. Its unique appearance and slow growth rate make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>Despite its eerie common name, it is not harmful and is relatively easy to care for.</p>
