<p>Cheilanthes peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, arid environments, often growing on limestone or granite substrates. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with dark green, leathery fronds that are resistant to drought. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh, dry conditions and is often found in crevices or on rock faces.</p>
