                    <h1>Cucumis pustulatus</h1>
<p>Cucumis pustulatus, commonly known as the horned cucumber, is a unique member of the Cucurbitaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Central America and features a distinctive, spiky, horn-like shape that sets it apart from other cucumbers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically harvested when they are still green and tender. Its leaves are broad and lobed, and it thrives in warm, sunny climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>The botanical interest of Cucumis pustulatus lies in its unusual morphology and its potential use in both ornamental and culinary contexts.</p>
