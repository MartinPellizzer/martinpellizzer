                    <h1>Calligonum rigidum var. australe</h1>
<p>Calligonum rigidum var. australe, commonly known as the Australian saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and gray-green foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It has a deep root system that enables it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its ability to stabilize soils and is used in rehabilitation of degraded lands.</p>
