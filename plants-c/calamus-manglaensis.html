                    <h1>Calamus manglaensis</h1>
<p>Calamus manglaensis, commonly known as the Mangla reed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the wetlands and marshy areas of northern India, particularly in the state of Himachal Pradesh. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems that form dense stands, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species.</p>
