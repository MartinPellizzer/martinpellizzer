                    <h1>Colobanthus aretioides</h1>
<p>Colobanthus aretioides, commonly known as Antarctic pearlwort, is a flowering plant native to the extreme environments of Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming plant with succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh, cold habitat. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom during the brief summer season. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and strong winds.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it an important indicator species for studying plant survival in extreme climates.</p>
