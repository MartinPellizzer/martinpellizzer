                    <h1>Carex stellulata var. omiana</h1>
<p>Carex stellulata var. omiana, commonly known as the star sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to aquatic environments.</p>
