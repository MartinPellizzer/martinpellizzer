                    <h1>Cardamine palustris subvar. erecta</h1>
<p>Cardamine palustris subvar. erecta, commonly known as the erect water-crowfoot, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features delicate, floating or submerged leaves that are typically divided into fine, thread-like segments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in a loose cluster. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for moist environments, it plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
