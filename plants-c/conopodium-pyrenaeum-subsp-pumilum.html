<p>Conopodium pyrenaeum subsp.</p>
<p>pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, often floating on the water surface.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to nutrient-poor environments and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
