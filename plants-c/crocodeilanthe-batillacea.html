                <h1>Crocodeilanthe batillacea</h1>
<p>Crocodeilanthe batillacea, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky substrates. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores produced in clusters on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Crocodeilanthe batillacea is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
