                    <h1>Cissus phyllomicron f. eglandulosa</h1>
<p>Cissus phyllomicron f. eglandulosa, commonly known as the dwarf grape ivy, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically smaller than those of the species, with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its trailing habit makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets or as a ground cover in shaded areas.</p>
