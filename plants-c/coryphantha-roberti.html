<p>Coryphantha roberti, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in spines and often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Coryphantha roberti is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and reducing water loss through its waxy surface.</p>
