<p>Cirsium aridum, commonly known as the desert thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions through its deep root system. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The showy purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
