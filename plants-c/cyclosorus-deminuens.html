                    <h1>Cyclosorus deminuens</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus deminuens, commonly known as the diminutive cyclosorus, is a small, perennial fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or marshy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
