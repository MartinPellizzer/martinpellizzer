<p>Ctenitis paucisora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, narrow fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of whitish茸毛. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates in humid, shaded environments, thriving in the understory of tropical forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in distinctive patterns.</p>
<p>Ctenitis paucisora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
