<p>Cyathea cynapifolia, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant has a thick, fibrous root system that helps anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in specialized structures called sori.</p>
<p>Cyathea cynapifolia plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to forest biodiversity and soil stability.</p>
