                    <h1>Cactus cornifer</h1>
<p>Cactus cornifer, commonly known as the cornflower cactus, is a unique succulent plant native to arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features a tall, branching stem covered in spiny, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its structure allows it to store water in its thick stems, adapting to harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>Despite its name, it is not related to true corn but is named for its clustered, corn-like flower arrangement.</p>
