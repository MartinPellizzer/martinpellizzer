                    <h1>Cereus tripteris</h1>
<p>Cereus tripteris, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and ability to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers typically bloom only once a year, making the plant a rare and striking sight in its natural habitat.</p>
