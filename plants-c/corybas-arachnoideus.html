<p>Corybas arachnoideus, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its striking, spider-like appearance with a single, hairy, urn-shaped flower. The plant is typically found in rocky or coastal habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, such as flies, which are attracted to its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
