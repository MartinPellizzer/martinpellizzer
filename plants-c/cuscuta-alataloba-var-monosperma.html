                    <h1>Cuscuta alataloba var. monosperma</h1>
<p>Cuscuta alataloba var. monosperma, commonly known as the single-seeded dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is characterized by its single-seeded fruit, which is a distinguishing feature of this variety. It typically infests a variety of herbaceous plants, often causing damage to agricultural crops.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves germination, attachment to a host, and the development of a complex system of haustoria to extract nutrients.</p>
