<p>Condylocarpon intermedium subsp.</p>
<p>intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate condylocarpon, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Trapeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is usually greenish to yellowish in color.</p>
<p>The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a cyanobacterial partner, which contributes to its ability to photosynthesize. It typically grows on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is relatively rare and is often found in specific microhabitats across the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
