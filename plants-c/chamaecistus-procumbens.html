                    <h1>Chamaecistus procumbens</h1>
<p>Chamaecistus procumbens, commonly known as desert sand verbena, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to survive in extreme desert conditions.</p>
