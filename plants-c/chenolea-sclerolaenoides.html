                    <h1>Chenolea sclerolaenoides</h1>
<p>Chenolea sclerolaenoides, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form that adheres tightly to rock surfaces. The plant's thallus is typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which together carry out photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Chenolea sclerolaenoides plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
