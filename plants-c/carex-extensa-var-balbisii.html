<p>Carex extensa var. balbisii, commonly known as the Balbis' sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, clustered spikes of pale to greenish flowers in the summer, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Carex extensa var. balbisii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
