<p>Cheilanthes contracta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in rocky soils and crevices, demonstrating a high degree of drought tolerance. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes contracta is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
