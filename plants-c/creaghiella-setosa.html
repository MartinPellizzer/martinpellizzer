                    <h1>Creaghiella setosa</h1>
<p>Creaghiella setosa, commonly known as the woolly broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. It typically grows on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants, often in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host plants.</p>
