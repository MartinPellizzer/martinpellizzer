                    <h1>Ceratonychia nidus</h1>
<p>Ceratonychia nidus, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the Aspleniaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped fronds that form a nest-like structure, providing a habitat for small organisms. The plant has a short, thick rhizome that anchors it to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically leathery and can grow quite large, sometimes reaching several feet in length.</p>
<p>The bird's nest fern is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>
