                    <h1>Cactus glaucus</h1>
<p>Cactus glaucus, commonly known as the blue agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in drought conditions. The plant produces striking blue-green leaves that are often coated with a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its flowers, which appear in clusters at the top of the plant, are typically white or pale purple.</p>
<p>Cactus glaucus is also valued for its sap, which is used in the production of agave-based products like tequila and soda.</p>
