                    <h1>Cheilanthes × prototinaei</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes × prototinaei, commonly known as the hybrid rock fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cheilanthes tamariscina and Cheilanthes prototinaei.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features a compact, cushion-like growth form with small, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the Polypodiaceae family.</p>
<p>This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to challenging soils.</p>
