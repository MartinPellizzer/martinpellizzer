                    <h1>Cenchrus aegyptius</h1>
<p>Cenchrus aegyptius, commonly known as the Egyptian needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system.</p>
<p>Cenchrus aegyptius is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
