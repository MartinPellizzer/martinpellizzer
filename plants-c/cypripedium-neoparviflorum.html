                    <h1>Cypripedium neoparviflorum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium neoparviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered slipper orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, a feature typical of many orchid species. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a distinct veined pattern on the petals and sepals. It thrives in cool, shaded forest environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is often protected in conservation programs.</p>
