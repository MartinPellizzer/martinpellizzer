<p>Catapodium halleri var. aristatum, commonly known as the swordgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, narrow blades that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a bluish-green color and a distinctive, sharp, sword-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in dryland environments.</p>
