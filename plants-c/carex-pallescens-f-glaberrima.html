<p>Carex pallescens f. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous sedge, is a variant of the common sedge species Carex pallescens.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous (hairless) foliage, which distinguishes it from the typical form. This plant is typically found in moist, acidic soils in wetlands or along the edges of ponds and streams. Its leaves are grass-like, with a narrow, linear shape, and it produces small, clustered spikelets during the flowering season.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native wetland environments.</p>
