                            <h1>Cieca Verbascifolia</h1>
<p>Velvetleaf, scientifically known as Cieca verbascifolia, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its velvety, hairy foliage and large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of purple and yellow. This plant thrives in harsh environments, often growing along rocky outcrops and in dry soils. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening. Despite its beauty, it is also a notable invasive species in some areas, posing challenges to local ecosystems.</p>
