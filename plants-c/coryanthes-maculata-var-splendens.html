<p>Coryanthes maculata var. splendens, commonly known as the Splendour Pitcher Plant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>

The plant's pitchers are typically red or orange with dark markings, which help attract prey. The inner surface of the pitcher is covered in a slippery waxy coating that prevents captured insects from escaping.</p>
<p>This species is highly sought after by plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and fascinating ecological adaptations.</p>
