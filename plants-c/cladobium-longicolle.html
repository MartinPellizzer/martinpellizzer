<p>It has a distinctive, leaf-like thallus with a pale green to yellowish coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. Cladobium longicolle is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth patterns make it an important indicator species for environmental health.</p>
