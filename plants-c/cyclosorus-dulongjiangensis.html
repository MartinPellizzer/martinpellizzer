<p>Cyclosorus dulongjiangensis, commonly known as the Dulongjiang water fern, is a rare aquatic fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that form a rosette-like structure on the water surface. The plant has finely divided fronds with a unique, spiral arrangement of pinnae, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often in shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
