                    <h1>Cirsium stellatum</h1>
<p>Cirsium stellatum, commonly known as star thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields. It has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its ability to spread rapidly and outcompete native vegetation.</p>
