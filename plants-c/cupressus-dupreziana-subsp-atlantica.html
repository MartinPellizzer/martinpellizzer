<p>Cupressus dupreziana subsp.</p>
<p>atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic cedar, is a rare and critically endangered conifer native to the Atlas Mountains of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and scale-like leaves that are dense and closely packed.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in humid and cool microclimates.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, this subspecies faces significant conservation challenges.</p>
