<p>Calyptrocalyx schlechterianus, commonly known as the Schlechter's calyptrocalyx, is a rare and little-known species within the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are usually opposite and elliptic, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant but poorly studied species.</p>
