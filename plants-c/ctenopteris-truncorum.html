                    <h1>Ctenopteris truncorum</h1>
<p>Ctenopteris truncorum, commonly known as the broad-leafed seaè’², is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, fan-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically divided into a series of segments with a distinctive notched or truncated appearance at the tips. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in shaded, moist areas.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and adaptability to coastal conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
