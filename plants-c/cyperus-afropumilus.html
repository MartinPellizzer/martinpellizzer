                    <h1>Cyperus afropumilus</h1>
<p>Cyperus afropumilus, commonly known as the dwarf flat sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are often surrounded by pale green or brown bracts. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Cyperus afropumilus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
