<p>Cuatrecasasiodendron, commonly known as the Cuban mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by winged seeds, typical of the Leguminosae family. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires a warm, tropical climate.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>
