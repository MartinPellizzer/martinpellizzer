<p>Cousinia cataonica, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a basal rosette, and the plant is well adapted to rocky and arid soils.</p>
<p>Cousinia cataonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display.</p>
