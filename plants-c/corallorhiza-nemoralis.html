                    <h1>Corallorhiza nemoralis</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza nemoralis, commonly known as the common coralroot, is an epiparasitic orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies on other plants for its nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in woodlands and heathlands. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a spike, and its roots are specialized to attach to the roots of host plants. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing the nutrient dynamics of its environment.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is not typically cultivated in gardens.</p>
