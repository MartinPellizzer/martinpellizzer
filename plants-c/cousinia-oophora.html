                    <h1>Cousinia oophora</h1>
<p>Cousinia oophora, commonly known as the "eggplant couch grass," is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cousinia oophora produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
