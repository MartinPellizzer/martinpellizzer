<p>Cinnamomum porphyrium, commonly known as the purple cinnamon, is a species of flowering plant in the Lauraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its bark, similar to cinnamon, has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>However, it is less commercially cultivated compared to other cinnamon species due to its limited yield and specific growing conditions.</p>
