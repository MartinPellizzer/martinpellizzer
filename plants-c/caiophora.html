                    <h1>Caiophora</h1>
<p>Caiophora, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic flowering plants native to Asia.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their large, showy flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in shades of pink, white, or yellow. The leaves are broad and floating, with a waxy surface that repels water, a feature known as the "lotus effect.". Caiophora species are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>They play an important ecological role in water ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
