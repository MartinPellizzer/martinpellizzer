                    <h1>Carelia microcephala</h1>
<p>Carelia microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf carelia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage with small, rounded leaves that give it a compact appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
