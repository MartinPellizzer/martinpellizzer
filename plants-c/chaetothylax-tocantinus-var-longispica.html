                    <h1>Chaetothylax tocantinus var. longispica</h1>
<p>Chaetothylax tocantinus var. longispica, commonly known as the long-spined cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, spiny areoles, which provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
