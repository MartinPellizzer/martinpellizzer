                    <h1>Cuscuta brevistyla var. brevistyla</h1>
<p>Cuscuta brevistyla var. brevistyla, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It has small, thread-like stems that缠绕 (twine) around its host, often forming a dense network. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and relies on wind for pollination. Its seeds are typically dispersed by animals or through mechanical means.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
