                    <h1>Cephalorrhynchus</h1>
<p>Cephalorrhynchus, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique, helmet-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored and intricately structured. They are native to various regions in South America, particularly in the Andes, where they thrive in high-altitude environments. Cephalorrhynchus species typically have pseudobulbs and are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their specialized adaptations to harsh mountainous climates and their role in local ecosystems.</p>
