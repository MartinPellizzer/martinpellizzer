<p>Caladenia longicauda subsp.</p>
<p>borealis, commonly known as the northern long-tongued orchid, is a striking terrestrial orchid native to southern Australia. It features a single, slender, erect stem that bears a single, lance-shaped flower with a prominent, hooded labellum.</p>
<p>The flower's vivid pink to purple coloration and elongated, hairy labellum are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. This subspecies is characterized by its long, slender spur, which facilitates nectar access for its pollinators.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sandy soils in heathlands and woodland habitats.</p>
