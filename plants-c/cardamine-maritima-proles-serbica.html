                    <h1>Cardamine maritima proles serbica</h1>
<p>Cardamine maritima proles serbica, commonly known as the Serbian coastal watercress, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the coastal regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in estuaries and tidal zones where it adapts to fluctuating water levels and high salinity. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, allowing it to maximize light absorption in aquatic habitats. Its flowers are delicate and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered an indicator species for coastal wetlands and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme environments.</p>
