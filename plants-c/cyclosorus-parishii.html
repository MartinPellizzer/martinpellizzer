<p>Cyclosorus parishii, commonly known as the New Zealand spiral liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name, and its distinctive, flattened thallus. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, across New Zealand. It plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
