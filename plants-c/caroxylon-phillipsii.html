<p>Caroxylon phillipsii, commonly known as the mountain ebony, is a rare and endangered shrub native to the high elevations of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and dense foliage, which help it survive in harsh, cold climates. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a small, black drupe that contains a single seed.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Caroxylon phillipsii is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
