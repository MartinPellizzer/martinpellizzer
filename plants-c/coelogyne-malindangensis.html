<p>Coelogyne malindangensis, commonly known as the Mindanao orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb that supports its growth in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a distinctive red or orange lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions for successful cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable to extinction.</p>
