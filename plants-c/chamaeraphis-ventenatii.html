                    <h1>Chamaeraphis ventenatii</h1>
<p>Chamaeraphis ventenatii, commonly known as the sand spiker or sea spiker, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Atlantic.</p>
<p>It is a small, annual herb that thrives in sandy or saline soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize sand dunes, making it ecologically significant in coastal environments.</p>
<p>Chamaeraphis ventenatii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its resilience and unique appearance.</p>
