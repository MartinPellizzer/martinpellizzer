<p>Carex polyrrhiza, commonly known as the broad-leaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in moist to aquatic environments, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Carex polyrrhiza plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
