                    <h1>Crepidium pleistanthum</h1>
<p>Crepidium pleistanthum, commonly known as the broad-leaved twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its linear, grass-like leaves and reduced, non-photosynthetic leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically arranged in a spike, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on orchid ecology and plant-fungus interactions.</p>
