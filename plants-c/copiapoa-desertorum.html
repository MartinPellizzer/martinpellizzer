<p>Copiapoa desertorum, commonly known as the Copiapoa cactus, is a species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus with a short, thick stem and typically produces white or yellow flowers during the cooler months. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to the arid environment, allowing it to absorb moisture from infrequent rains. Its spines are short and cylindrical, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Copiapoa desertorum is well-suited for cultivation in dry climates and is often grown as an ornamental plant.</p>
