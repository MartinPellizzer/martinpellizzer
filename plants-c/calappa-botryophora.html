                    <h1>Calappa botryophora</h1>
<p>Calappa botryophora, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense cluster, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
