<p>Campanula bielzii, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>

The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white down, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
