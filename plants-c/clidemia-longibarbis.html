                    <h1>Clidemia longibarbis</h1>
<p>Clidemia longibarbis, commonly known as the long-barbed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has a unique ability to absorb water and nutrients from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria. It typically grows on trees such as mahogany and ceiba, forming dense, tangled masses that can inhibit the growth of its host.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity, it plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of tropical forests.</p>
