<p>Coccoloba arborescens, commonly known as the red mangrove or red buttonwood, is a coastal plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests. The plant has smooth, waxy leaves that are typically red or reddish-purple in color, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Its small, white flowers are followed by round, red berries that provide food for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Coccoloba arborescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting biodiversity in tidal zones.</p>
