<p>Coniogramme fraxinea, commonly known as the yellow wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
