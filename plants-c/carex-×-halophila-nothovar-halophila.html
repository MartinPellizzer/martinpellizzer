                    <h1>Carex × halophila nothovar. halophila</h1>
<p>Carex × halophila nothovar. halophila, commonly known as the salt marsh sedge, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, typically Carex acutata and Carex lyngbyei.</p>
<p>It is native to coastal wetlands and is adapted to saline and brackish environments, making it an important component of tidal ecosystems. The plant forms dense tussocks with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding makes it a key species in salt marsh restoration efforts.</p>
