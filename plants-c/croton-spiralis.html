                    <h1>Croton spiralis</h1>
<p>Croton spiralis, commonly known as spiral croton, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiraling arrangement of leaves that give it a distinctive, almost otherworldly appearance. The leaves are typically glossy and come in a variety of colors, including green, red, and yellow, depending on the variety. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
