<p>Cyclosorus latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. The plant has lance-shaped, broad leaves that are often divided into smaller segments, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus latifolius plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
