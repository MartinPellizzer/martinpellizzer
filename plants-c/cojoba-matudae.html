                <h1>Cojoba matudae</h1>
<p>Cojoba matudae, commonly known as the Matudae's cactus, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can reach up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring season, which are followed by small, red fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cojoba matudae is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
