<p>Calyxhymenia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate calyxhymenia, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a prostrate or decumbent growth habit, with slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Calyxhymenia prostrata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
