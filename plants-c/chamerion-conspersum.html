<p>Chamerion conspersum, commonly known as fireweed, is a herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Fireweed is often found in disturbed soils, including those near roadsides and burned areas, due to its ability to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>It is also known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces.</p>
