                    <h1>Cnicus lomatolepis</h1>
<p>Cnicus lomatolepis, commonly known as the desert thistle, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. Its leaves are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Cnicus lomatolepis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
