                    <h1>Coffea angolensis</h1>
<p>Coffea angolensis, commonly known as the Angola coffee plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to central and southern Africa, particularly found in countries like Angola, Zambia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves and produces small, white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries containing the coffee seeds. While it is not widely cultivated for commercial coffee production, it is of interest to botanists and researchers due to its unique genetic makeup and potential for breeding new coffee varieties.</p>
<p>Its ecological role in its native habitat also makes it an important species for conservation efforts.</p>
