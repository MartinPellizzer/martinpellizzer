                    <h1>Carex subsalsa</h1>
<p>Carex subsalsa, commonly known as salt marsh sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in marshes and tidal flats. The plant has grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and somewhat hairy, and it produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Carex subsalsa is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
