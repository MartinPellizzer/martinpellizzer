                    <h1>Cachrys alpina</h1>
<p>Cachrys alpina, commonly known as the alpine cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growths that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh alpine environments. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in cold, dry climates. It produces yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Cachrys alpina is often used in alpine gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
