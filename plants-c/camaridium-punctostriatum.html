<p>Camaridium punctostriatum, commonly known as the spotted-striated orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant's leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its humid environment. It thrives in shaded, moist conditions and is often found growing epiphytically on trees or in rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
