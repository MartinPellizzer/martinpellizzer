                    <h1>Caralluma lateritia var. stevensonii</h1>
<p>Caralluma lateritia var. stevensonii, commonly known as the Stevenson's prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem covered in spiny tubercles, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom during the rainy season, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat.</p>
