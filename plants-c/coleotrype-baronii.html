                    <h1>Coleotrype baronii</h1>
<p>Coleotrype baronii, commonly known as the Baron's coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a spike, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on the bark of trees.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
