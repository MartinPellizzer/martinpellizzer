                    <h1>Cicer pungens</h1>
<p>Cicer pungens, commonly known as the burr clover, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being hairy and slightly serrated. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads, which are often referred to as "burs" due to their prickly appearance. Cicer pungens is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments.</p>
<p>Its seeds are encased in tough, spiny pods that help in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or human clothing.</p>
