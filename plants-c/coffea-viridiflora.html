<p>Coffea viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered coffee.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical Africa, particularly found in countries like Nigeria and Cameroon. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are berries that mature to a yellowish color, containing two seeds used for coffee production.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated for commercial coffee due to its lower yields and specific growing requirements.</p>
