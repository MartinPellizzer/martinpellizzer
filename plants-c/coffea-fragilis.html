                    <h1>Coffea fragilis</h1>
<p>Coffea fragilis, commonly known as the fragile coffee plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds used for coffee production. It is notable for its delicate structure and is often grown as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely cultivated for commercial coffee due to its low yield and specific environmental requirements.</p>
