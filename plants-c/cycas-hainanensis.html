                <h1>Cycas hainanensis</h1>
<p>Cycas hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan cycad, is a species of cycad native to the island of Hainan in China.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing plant with a stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male cones typically appearing at the base of the plant and female cones at the top. Cycas hainanensis is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils and partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
