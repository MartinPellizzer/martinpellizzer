                    <h1>Cotoneaster serotinus</h1>
<p>Cotoneaster serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters, featuring dense, thorny branches and elliptical, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. Cotoneaster serotinus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value, providing seasonal interest with its flowers, foliage, and berries.</p>
<p>However, it can be invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native plants in the wild.</p>
