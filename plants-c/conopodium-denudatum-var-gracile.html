<p>Conopodium denudatum var. gracile, commonly known as the slender bladderworts, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots.</p>
<p>Conopodium denudatum var. gracile is a carnivorous plant that uses its specialized bladders to capture and digest prey, aiding in its nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
