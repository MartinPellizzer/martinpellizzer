<p>Cyclosorus chaseanus, commonly known as the Chase's cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, delicate fronds that form a rosette shape, often floating just below the water's surface. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
