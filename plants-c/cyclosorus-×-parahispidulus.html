                    <h1>Cyclosorus × parahispidulus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus × parahispidulus, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a rare and intriguing plant that results from the cross between Cyclosorus hispidus and Cyclosorus pinnatus.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant exhibits a unique combination of traits from its parent species, including the morphology of its rhizomes and the structure of its sporangia. It is typically found in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes, where it can thrive in nutrient-rich conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Cyclosorus × parahispidulus is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
