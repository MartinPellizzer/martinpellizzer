<p>Caladenia dimorpha, commonly known as the red-tongued spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and two distinct types of leaves, hence its scientific name "dimorpha," meaning "two forms.". The plant produces a single, curved spike bearing several small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive red lip. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats, often in heathlands or woodland areas.</p>
<p>Caladenia dimorpha is a protected species due to its rarity and is often found in specific regions of New South Wales and Victoria.</p>
