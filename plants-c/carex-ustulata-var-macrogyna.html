                    <h1>Carex ustulata var. macrogyna</h1>
<p>Carex ustulata var. macrogyna, commonly known as the large-fruit sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces showy, spike-like inflorescences that are often reddish or purplish in color. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>The varietal name "macrogyna" refers to its relatively large, fleshy fruits, which are a distinguishing feature of this subspecies.</p>
