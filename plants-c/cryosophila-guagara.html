                    <h1>Cryosophila guagara</h1>
<p>Cryosophila guagara, commonly known as the Guaran√° cryosophila, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers and slender, woody stems. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is adapted to grow in rocky soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a subject of ongoing botanical research.</p>
