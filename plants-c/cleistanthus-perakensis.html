<p>Cleistanthus perakensis, commonly known as the Borneo ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to termites. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape with a smooth margin.
