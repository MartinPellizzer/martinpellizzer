                    <h1>Cactus leucotrichus</h1>
<p>Cactus leucotrichus, commonly known as the white-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its spines are white and dense, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Cactus leucotrichus plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing shelter and food for various desert animals.</p>
