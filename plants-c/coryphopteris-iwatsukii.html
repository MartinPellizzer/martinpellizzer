                    <h1>Coryphopteris iwatsukii</h1>
<p>Coryphopteris iwatsukii, commonly known as the Japanese tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, compound fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique trait makes it a fascinating subject in both botanical and ecological studies.</p>
