                    <h1>Calvoa</h1>
<p>Calvoa, commonly known as the "milkweed of the Andes," is a genus of flowering plants native to South America.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their hairy stems and showy, often yellow or orange, flowers. Calvoa species are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, where they have adapted to withstand drought conditions. The leaves are usually alternate and may have a glandular surface, which helps in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Some species of Calvoa produce a milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus.</p>
