<p>Cynodon dactylon var. parviglumis, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. This variety is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for warm climates. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to spread rapidly and form dense turf.</p>
<p>It is often used in landscaping and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
