<p>Chamaeraphis palmifolia, commonly known as the palmleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by seed capsules that disperse windborne seeds. Its leaves are palmately divided, giving it a distinctive appearance that resembles a miniature palm tree.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to survive in harsh conditions, it is often used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
