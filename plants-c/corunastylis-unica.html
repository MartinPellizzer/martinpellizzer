                    <h1>Corunastylis unica</h1>
<p>Corunastylis unica, commonly known as the singular spike orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a single spike bearing several small, pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it blooms during the cooler months, making it a challenging but rewarding subject for botanists and horticulturists.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
