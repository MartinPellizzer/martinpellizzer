<p>Cardamine hirsuta subsp.</p>
<p>flexuosa, commonly known as the curly watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wet, shaded environments in North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, upright stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in stream banks, marshes, and other damp habitats where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
