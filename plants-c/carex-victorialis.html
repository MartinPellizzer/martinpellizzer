                    <h1>Carex victorialis</h1>
<p>Carex victorialis, commonly known as the yellow flowering sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, grass-green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in dense, spike-like clusters. Native to wetland areas in North America, it thrives in moist to wet soils and full to partial sun. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an effective pioneer species in disturbed wetland habitats.</p>
