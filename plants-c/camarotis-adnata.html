<p>Camarotis adnata, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as oaks and hawthorns, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are white or pale green, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Camarotis adnata is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host trees.</p>
