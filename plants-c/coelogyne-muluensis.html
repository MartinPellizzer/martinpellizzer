                    <h1>Coelogyne muluensis</h1>
<p>Coelogyne muluensis, commonly known as the Mulu orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the mountainous regions of western Thailand and southern Myanmar.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb-like structure that stores water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces strikingly fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive red or orange lip. Its flowers typically bloom during the dry season, making it a notable species for orchid enthusiasts and botanists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Coelogyne muluensis is considered threatened and is protected in some regions.</p>
