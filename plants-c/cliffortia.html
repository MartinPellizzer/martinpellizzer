<p>Cliffortia, commonly known as the "cliff's flower," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where they thrive in rocky and coastal environments. Cliffortia species are characterized by their delicate, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. They typically have small, compound leaves and produce legume-like pods that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Due to their specific habitat requirements, many Cliffortia species are threatened by habitat loss and climate change.</p>
