                    <h1>Cyperus compactus var. tenerior</h1>
<p>Cyperus compactus var. tenerior, commonly known as the compact spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. Its small, clustered inflorescences produce tiny flowers, and it often serves as a pioneer species in disturbed wetland environments.</p>
<p>The variety tenerior is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly hairy foliage compared to other forms of Cyperus compactus.</p>
