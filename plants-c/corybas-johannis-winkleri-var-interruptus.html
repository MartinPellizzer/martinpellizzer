                    <h1>Corybas johannis-winkleri var. interruptus</h1>
<p>Corybas johannis-winkleri var. interruptus, commonly known as the interrupted hooded orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, hood-like floral structure that encloses the reproductive organs, a feature typical of the Corybas genus. The plant produces small, often pale green or yellowish flowers that are adapted for specific pollinators, such as flies or beetles. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments within montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
