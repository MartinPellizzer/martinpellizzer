                    <h1>Cochranea pycnophylla</h1>
<p>Cochranea pycnophylla, commonly known as the dense-leaved cochranea, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, overlapping foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which provide some protection against desiccation.</p>
<p>Cochranea pycnophylla is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
