<p>Chenopodium nutans subsp.</p>
<p>eremaeum, commonly known as desert goosefoot, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax.</p>
<p>The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, branching stalks. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep taproots that allow it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This species is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is considered a pioneer species in disturbed or degraded habitats.</p>
