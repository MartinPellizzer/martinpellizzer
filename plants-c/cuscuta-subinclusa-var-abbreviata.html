                    <h1>Cuscuta subinclusa var. abbreviata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta subinclusa var. abbreviata, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. This variety is typically found in open habitats such as fields and disturbed areas, where it attaches to a variety of host plants. Its life cycle involves germinating seeds that then establish parasitic connections with host roots.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
