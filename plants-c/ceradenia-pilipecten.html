<p>Ceradenia pilipecten, commonly known as the silky hair-leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in loose racemes, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species.</p>
