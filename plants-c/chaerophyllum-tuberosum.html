                    <h1>Chaerophyllum tuberosum</h1>
<p>Chaerophyllum tuberosum, commonly known as wild parsnip, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a robust, branched stem and pinnately divided, fern-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels, which bloom in the summer. Its root system consists of thick, fleshy roots that are sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant contain phototoxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals if handled or ingested.</p>
