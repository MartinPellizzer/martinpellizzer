<p>Chrysodium decrescens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is characterized by its low-growing habit with spreading stems. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Chrysodium decrescens is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions.</p>
