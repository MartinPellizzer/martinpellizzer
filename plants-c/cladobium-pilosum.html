                    <h1>Cladobium pilosum</h1>
<p>Cladobium pilosum, commonly known as the hairy cushion cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and the presence of fine, white hairs covering its stems, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its stems are typically short and branching, forming a cushion-like structure that protects it from harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Cladobium pilosum is well adapted to survive in low-water environments, making it a resilient and unique member of the cactus family.</p>
