                    <h1>Chamaecytisus glaber</h1>
<p>Chamaecytisus glaber, commonly known as the Scotch broom, is a flowering shrub native to western Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are arranged in pairs along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for erosion control.</p>
<p>However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal.</p>
