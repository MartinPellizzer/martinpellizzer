<p>Cephalophora aromatica, commonly known as the sweet sedge, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that grows in marshy areas, characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves and showy, fragrant white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, three-lobed seed capsules that mature in late summer. Its aromatic qualities are derived from the volatile oils present in its leaves and flowers.</p>
<p>Cephalophora aromatica plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds.</p>
