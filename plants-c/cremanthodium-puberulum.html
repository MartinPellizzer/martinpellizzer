<p>Cremanthodium puberulum, commonly known as the hairy cremanthodium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its hairy leaves and stems help reduce water loss, making it well-suited for its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Cremanthodium puberulum is often found in open grasslands and along rocky outcrops.</p>
