<p>Chlorogalum pomeridianum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser desert candle, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically shorter and more compact compared to the standard variety. The plant produces a tall, branched stem that bears white to pale pink flowers, which open in the late afternoon. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to dry conditions and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant for xeriscaping.</p>
