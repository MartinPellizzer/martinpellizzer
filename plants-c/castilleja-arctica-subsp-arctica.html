<p>Castilleja arctica subsp.</p>
<p>arctica, commonly known as Arctic milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system.</p>
<p>The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers, typically in clusters, during the short growing season of its habitat. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of high-altitude environments.</p>
