<p>Coincya pseudoerucastrum subsp.</p>
<p>cintrana, commonly known as the slender water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are borne on short pedicels. Its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively, allowing it to form dense mats in its environment.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to nutrient-rich waters and can tolerate a range of water conditions.</p>
