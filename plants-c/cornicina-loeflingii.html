                    <h1>Cornicina loeflingii</h1>
<p>Cornicina loeflingii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and its striking, white, ghost-like flowers. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and filtered sunlight, to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Cornicina loeflingii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
