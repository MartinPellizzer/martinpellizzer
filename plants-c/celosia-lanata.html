                    <h1>Celosia lanata</h1>
<p>Celosia lanata, commonly known as the flameflower or woolly celosia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, feathery bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers at the base of the bract clusters. Celosia lanata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its ability to attract birds and its long-lasting blooms make it a valuable addition to gardens.</p>
