<p>Coelogyne ghatakii, commonly known as the Ghatakii orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the forests of India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters of 3 to 5, often in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without being parasitic. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered with a thick layer of brownish bark, which helps it store water.</p>
<p>Coelogyne ghatakii prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
