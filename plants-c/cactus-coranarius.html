                    <h1>Cactus coranarius</h1>
<p>Cactus coranarius, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species native to the dry regions of Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is a sprawling shrub characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, typical of desert plants. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to arid environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens.</p>
