                    <h1>Coryphantha grandiflora</h1>
<p>Coryphantha grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered pincushion cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a globular shape and bright green stems that store water. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Coryphantha grandiflora is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal water once established.</p>
