                    <h1>Crucianella chlorantha</h1>
<p>Crucianella chlorantha, commonly known as the sea bean or sea bean tree, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in salty, arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, bean-like fruits that are adapted for dispersal by water. Its root system is highly salt-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky coastal soils.</p>
<p>Crucianella chlorantha plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
