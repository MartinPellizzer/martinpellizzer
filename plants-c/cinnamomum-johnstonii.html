<p>Cinnamomum johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's cinnamon, is a species of flowering plant in the laurel family, Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the islands of the South Pacific, particularly parts of Fiji and Tonga. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in white or pale yellow. Its bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine and for flavoring, similar to other cinnamon species.</p>
