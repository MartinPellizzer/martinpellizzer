                    <h1>Cyclobalanopsis lenticellata</h1>
<p>Cyclobalanopsis lenticellata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironwood, is a member of the Fagaceae family, characterized by its hard, durable wood and evergreen foliage.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces small, chestnut-like fruits that are encased in a spiny husk, which splits open to release winged seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and革质 (leathery), with a prominent midrib and a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Cyclobalanopsis lenticellata is valued for its ecological importance and is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber.</p>
