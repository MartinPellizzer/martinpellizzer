                    <h1>Cladium mariscoides</h1>
<p>Cladium mariscoides, commonly known as the sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in shallow water or saturated soils, making it a key component of marsh and swamp ecosystems. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Cladium mariscoides plays an important role in the ecological balance of wetlands by contributing to nutrient cycling and supporting biodiversity.</p>
