                    <h1>Cuscuta salina var. squamigera</h1>
<p>Cuscuta salina var. squamigera, commonly known as saltblight dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that attaches itself to host plants to derive nutrients.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow or orange color and lack of leaves, relying instead on a network of slender, thread-like stems. This species is typically found in coastal areas and saline environments, where it thrives in salty soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers produce seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread to new host plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants, particularly in agricultural settings.</p>
