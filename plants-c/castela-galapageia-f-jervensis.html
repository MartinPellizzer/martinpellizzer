<p>Castela galapageia f. jervensis, commonly known as the Galapagos castela, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the Galápagos Islands.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the Galápagos archipelago.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
