                    <h1>Ceraia fimbriata</h1>
<p>Ceraia fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed sea hare, is a species of sea slug found in tropical and subtropical marine environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aeplysiidae and is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and distinctive fringed mantle. The plant-like appearance of the fringed sea hare is due to its leafy, branched gills and the presence of a mantle that can resemble plant structures. It is primarily herbivorous, feeding on algae and other marine plants, which contributes to its ecological role in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to change color and its role in the food web of marine environments.</p>
