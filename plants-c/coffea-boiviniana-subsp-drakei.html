<p>Coffea boiviniana subsp.</p>
<p>drakei, commonly known as Drake's coffee, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Coffea genus. It is native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its small, oval-shaped berries and dark green, glossy leaves. It is adapted to cool, moist climates and requires well-drained, acidic soil to thrive.</p>
