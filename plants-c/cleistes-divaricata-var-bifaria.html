                    <h1>Cleistes divaricata var. bifaria</h1>
<p>Cleistes divaricata var. bifaria, commonly known as the twin-flowered cleistocarp, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that are often closed at maturity, a feature typical of cleistocarps. The plant produces small, greenish-white blooms with a strong, sweet fragrance, which attracts specific pollinators. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a waxy texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
