                    <h1>Caturus oblongatus</h1>
<p>Caturus oblongatus, commonly known as the oblong leaf cactus, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, fleshy stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce evaporation.</p>
<p>Caturus oblongatus is well adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
