<p>Cheilanthes hirta var. laxa, commonly known as the hairy rockcap, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in crevices or on limestone formations. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant in harsh environments.</p>
