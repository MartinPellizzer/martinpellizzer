                    <h1>Cuscuta stapfiana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta stapfiana, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to various regions in Asia and is often found on crops like rice and millet. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its wide distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
