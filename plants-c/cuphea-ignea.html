<p>Cuphea ignea, commonly known as the firecracker plant, is a flowering shrub native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that resemble tiny firecrackers, which are not petals but modified leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Cuphea ignea is relatively low maintenance and drought-tolerant once established.</p>
