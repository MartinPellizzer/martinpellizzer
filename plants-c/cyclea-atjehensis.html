<p>Cyclea atjehensis, commonly known as the Atjeh cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the island of Sumatra in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Cyclea atjehensis is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
