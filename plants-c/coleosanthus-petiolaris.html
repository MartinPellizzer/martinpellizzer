<p>Coleosanthus petiolaris, commonly known as the petiole cycad, is a unique species of cycad native to the island of Tonga.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with the male cones appearing at the base of the plant and the female cones emerging from the crown. Its foliage is evergreen, and the plant is adapted to grow in coastal and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
