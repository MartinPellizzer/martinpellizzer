                    <h1>Cyperus erythraeus</h1>
<p>Cyperus erythraeus, commonly known as the spiny flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a common invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>Cyperus erythraeus is often used in traditional medicine and has also been studied for its potential ecological roles in wetland ecosystems.</p>
