                    <h1>Cactus melocactus var. depressus</h1>
<p>Cactus melocactus var. depressus, commonly known as the Mexican hat cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, ribbed stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its fleshy stems are covered in spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This cactus is well adapted to harsh desert environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
