<p>Coelostelma refractum, commonly known as the glassy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically grows on the branches of trees, drawing water and nutrients from its host. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow and are borne in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Coelostelma refractum is known for its translucent, glass-like appearance, which gives it its common name.</p>
