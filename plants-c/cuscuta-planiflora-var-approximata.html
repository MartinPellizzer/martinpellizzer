                    <h1>Cuscuta planiflora var. approximata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta planiflora var. approximata, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is widely distributed across temperate regions and can infest a variety of agricultural and ornamental crops. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, making it a persistent weed in many ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive on multiple hosts contribute to its invasive potential in certain areas.</p>
