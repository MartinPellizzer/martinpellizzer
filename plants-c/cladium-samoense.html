                    <h1>Cladium samoense</h1>
<p>Cladium samoense, commonly known as the Samoan sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly Samoa and nearby islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy environments, where it forms dense stands that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Cladium samoense plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting a variety of wildlife and contributing to the overall biodiversity of wetland ecosystems.</p>
