                    <h1>Cheilanthes argentea f. obscura</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes argentea f. obscura, commonly known as the dark silver fern, is a fern species native to arid and rocky habitats in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and dark green, leathery fronds that are shorter and more densely packed compared to the typical variety. The plant's leaves are typically divided into narrow, linear segments, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the fronds. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy and resilient plant in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in crevices and on rock faces, where it forms dense, mat-like colonies.</p>
