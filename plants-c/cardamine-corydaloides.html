<p>It is a small herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a serrated edge and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in calcareous soils and is characterized by its peppery taste, similar to that of watercress.</p>
