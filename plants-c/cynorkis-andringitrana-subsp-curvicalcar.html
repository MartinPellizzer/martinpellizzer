<p>Cynorkis andringitrana subsp.</p>
<p>curvicalcar, commonly known as the curved-spined orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, curved spines on the pseudobulbs, which are an adaptation for its unique ecological niche.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, with a complex structure typical of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
