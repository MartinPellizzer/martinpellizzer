<p>Coccoloba caesia, commonly known as the red mangrove or red mangrove tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red, woody exodermis that covers the roots, which helps in gas exchange in aquatic environments. The plant is native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of the southeastern United States. It thrives in brackish or saltwater environments, often forming dense mangrove forests.</p>
<p>Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a waxy surface that aids in reducing water loss.</p>
