<p>Clusia articulata subsp.</p>
<p>mirandensis, commonly known as the Mirandense Clusia, is a tropical shrub native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, facilitating dispersal by wind or animals.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and adaptability to shaded conditions.</p>
