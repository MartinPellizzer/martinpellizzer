<p>Cheilanthes erecta, commonly known as the upright rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and rocky environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched fronds that are typically 10â€“30 cm in length. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in crevices or on rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with lanceolate to ovate pinnae that are often covered in a fine, whitish tomentum.</p>
