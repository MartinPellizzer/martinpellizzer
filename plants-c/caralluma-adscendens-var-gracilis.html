                    <h1>Caralluma adscendens var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Caralluma adscendens var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that grow upright, often branching at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, a feature common in xerophytic plants.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
