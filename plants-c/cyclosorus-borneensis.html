                    <h1>Cyclosorus borneensis</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus borneensis, commonly known as the Borneo cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to the freshwater habitats of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often anchored to submerged substrates. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive system, with sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of its leaves. Its morphology includes a short, creeping rhizome and small, lanceolate leaflets.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Cyclosorus borneensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical research.</p>
