                    <h1>Cloezia artensis var. riparia</h1>
<p>Cloezia artensis var. riparia, commonly known as the river cloezia, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands and riverbanks of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often with a reddish tinge. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its moist habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and supporting local insect populations.</p>
