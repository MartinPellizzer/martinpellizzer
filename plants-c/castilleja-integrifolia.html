<p>Castilleja integrifolia, commonly known as the sticky monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its specialized roots. The plant features bright orange to red tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple and often covered in a sticky substance, which helps in retaining moisture.</p>
<p>Castilleja integrifolia typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
