                    <h1>Cuscuta campestris</h1>
<p>Cuscuta campestris, commonly known as the field dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to its host using specialized haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on crops such as corn and soybeans. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to spread widely.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
