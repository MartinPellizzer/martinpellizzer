                    <h1>Cordia calcicola</h1>
<p>Cordia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone cordia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, ovate leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Cordia calcicola is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
