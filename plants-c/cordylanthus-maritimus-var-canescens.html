                    <h1>Cordylanthus maritimus var. canescens</h1>
<p>Cordylanthus maritimus var. canescens, commonly known as the coastal cordylanthus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and grayish-blue foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, pink to lavender flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong coastal winds.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats, playing a role in stabilizing sand and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
