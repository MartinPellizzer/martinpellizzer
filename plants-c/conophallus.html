<p>Conophallus, commonly known as the "crown cap" or "cap mushroom," is a genus of fungi that belongs to the family Tricholomataceae.</p>
<p>These fungi are characterized by their distinctive, often brightly colored caps that are typically adorned with a unique, crown-like structure on the upper surface. The stem is usually slender and may have a fibrous or reticulate pattern. Conophallus species are typically found in forested areas, growing on decaying wood or soil.</p>
<p>They are not considered edible and are often avoided due to their potential toxicity.</p>
