                    <h1>Cycas boddamii</h1>
<p>Cycas boddamii, commonly known as the Boddam's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Cycas boddamii is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection, making it a conservation priority.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and evolutionary history make it an important subject in botanical research.</p>
