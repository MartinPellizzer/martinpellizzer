                    <h1>Cormophyllum horridum</h1>
<p>Cormophyllum horridum, commonly known as the spiny corm plant, is a unique member of the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its underground corm, which serves as a storage organ and allows it to survive in adverse conditions. The plant produces a tall, spiky inflorescence that resembles a torch, with brightly colored bracts that attract pollinators. Its foliage consists of broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in tiny, hair-like structures.</p>
<p>This plant is native to tropical regions and thrives in humid, well-drained soils.</p>
