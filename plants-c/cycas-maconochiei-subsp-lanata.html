<p>Cycas maconochiei subsp.</p>
<p>lanata, commonly known as the woolly cycas, is a cycad species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, cone-like structures, with the female cones bearing ovules that develop into seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
