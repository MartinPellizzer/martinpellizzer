                    <h1>Campylostemon lindequistianus var. minor</h1>
<p>Campylostemon lindequistianus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser prickly pear, is a shrub-like cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of spiny, fleshy stems that store water, typical of xerophytic adaptations. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, which are pollinated by various insects and birds. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a deep root system to access underground water sources.</p>
<p>This variety is less commonly cultivated than its larger relative, Campylostemon lindequistianus, but it is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance.</p>
