<p>Chrysothamnus parryi subsp.</p>
<p>vulcanicus, commonly known as the Vulcan's goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, golden-yellow foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in areas with volcanic soil, reflecting its association with geologically active regions.</p>
