                    <h1>Cyperus thomsonii</h1>
<p>Cyperus thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and is characterized by its three-ranked leaves and spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps, ditches, and along riverbanks. Its slender, grass-like stems are often mistaken for true grasses, but it lacks the typical grass flower structure.</p>
<p>Cyperus thomsonii is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain environments.</p>
