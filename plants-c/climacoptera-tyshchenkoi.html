                    <h1>Climacoptera tyshchenkoi</h1>
<p>Climacoptera tyshchenkoi, commonly known as the Shapley's climacoptera, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth form with dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
