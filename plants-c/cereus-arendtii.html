                    <h1>Cereus arendtii</h1>
<p>Cereus arendtii, commonly known as the Arendt's night bloomer, is a striking cactus native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, a feature typical of many night-blooming cacti. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions.</p>
<p>Cereus arendtii thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
