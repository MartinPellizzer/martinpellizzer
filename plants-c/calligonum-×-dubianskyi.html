                    <h1>Calligonum × dubianskyi</h1>
<p>Calligonum × dubianskyi, commonly known as the hybrid saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Calligonum leucocarpum and Calligonum elongatum, exhibiting traits from both parent species. The plant is characterized by its dense, low-growing form and grayish-green foliage, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, edible berries.</p>
<p>Calligonum × dubianskyi is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in saline soils.</p>
