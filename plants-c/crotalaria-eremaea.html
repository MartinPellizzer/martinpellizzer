<p>Crotalaria eremaea, commonly known as the desert crownflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Crotalaria eremaea is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil fertility in degraded landscapes.</p>
