                    <h1>Castanea eonii</h1>
<p>Castanea eonii, commonly known as the Eonii chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It produces large, spiny husks that encase its edible, sweet, and nutty seeds. The leaves are broad, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a dark green upper surface. The tree thrives in cool, moist climates and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its fruiting season typically occurs in late summer, making it a valuable resource for both wildlife and local communities.</p>
