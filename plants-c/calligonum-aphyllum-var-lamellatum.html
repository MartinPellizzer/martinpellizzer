                    <h1>Calligonum aphyllum var. lamellatum</h1>
<p>Calligonum aphyllum var. lamellatum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often reduced to scale-like structures, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
