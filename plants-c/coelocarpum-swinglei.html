                    <h1>Coelocarpum swinglei</h1>
<p>Coelocarpum swinglei, commonly known as the Swingle's coelocarpum, is a rare and little-studied member of the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical, leathery leaves. It produces small, red berries that are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
