                    <h1>Cuscuta palaestina var. palaestina</h1>
<p>Cuscuta palaestina var. palaestina, commonly known as the Palestinian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and is often found growing on crops such as wheat and barley. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
