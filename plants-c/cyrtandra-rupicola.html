<p>Cyrtandra rupicola, commonly known as the rock Cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue-violet flowers. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and cliffs, where it forms dense mats or small shrubs. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
