                    <h1>Canistrum fosterianum</h1>
<p>Canistrum fosterianum, commonly known as the Foster's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries. It is often found in areas with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
