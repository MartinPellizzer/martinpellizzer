                    <h1>Cumulopuntia pentlandii var. colchana</h1>
<p>Cumulopuntia pentlandii var. colchana, commonly known as the Colchana cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height, often forming dense, bushy clumps. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its stems are ribbed and covered in white to pale blue spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly adapted to harsh, sun-exposed environments, making it a notable example of desert flora resilience.</p>
