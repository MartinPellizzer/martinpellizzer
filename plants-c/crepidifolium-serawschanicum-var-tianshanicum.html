                    <h1>Crepidifolium serawschanicum var. tianshanicum</h1>
<p>Crepidifolium serawschanicum var. tianshanicum, commonly known as the Tianshan crepidifolium, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Tianshan Mountains in China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, strap-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, blooming in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and human activity.</p>
