                    <h1>Cistus ladanifer f. inmaculatus</h1>
<p>Cistus ladanifer f. inmaculatus, commonly known as the white-flowered rock rose, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of white, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for Mediterranean climates. Its essential oils, particularly ladanum, have been historically used in perfumery and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The variety 'inmaculatus' is distinguished by its lack of the typical red markings on the flower buds, giving it a more pristine appearance.</p>
