<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, arid environments. The plant has fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into lanceolate, serrated leaves. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically green, with a leathery texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
