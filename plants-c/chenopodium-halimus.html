<p>Chenopodium halimus, commonly known as desert goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, herbaceous annual or perennial plant that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are typically succulent and oval-shaped. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system and waxy leaf surface.</p>
<p>Chenopodium halimus is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
