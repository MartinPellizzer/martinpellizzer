                            <h1>Cerastium Pumilum Var. Glutinosum</h1>
<p>Cerastium pumilum var. glutinosum is a small, low-growing plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is known for its delicate, sticky leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early summer. This variant of Cerastium pumilum is particularly noted for its glandular hairs that give it a distinctive, sticky texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Despite its modest size, it plays an important role in supporting local insect populations.</p>
