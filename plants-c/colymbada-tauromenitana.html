                    <h1>Colymbada tauromenitana</h1>
<p>Colymbada tauromenitana, commonly known as the Sicilian water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of southern Italy.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its submerged, filamentous stems and small, star-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and lakes, where it can access sufficient sunlight for photosynthesis. Its flowers, which are usually greenish-yellow, are borne on short stalks and are adapted for water pollination.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and pollution, Colymbada tauromenitana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
