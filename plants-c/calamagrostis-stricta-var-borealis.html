                    <h1>Calamagrostis stricta var. borealis</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis stricta var. borealis, commonly known as the northern tussock grass, is a perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage that reflects the harsh, cold environments it inhabits. The plant produces tall, slender culms with panicles of greenish-white to pale yellow flowers in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, stabilizing soil in nutrient-poor, windy conditions.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is adapted to low temperatures and has a high tolerance for desiccation and frost.</p>
