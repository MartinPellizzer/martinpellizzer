                    <h1>Cycas taiwaniana</h1>
<p>Cycas taiwaniana, commonly known as the Taiwan cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant produces cones, with the female cones bearing ovules that develop into seeds after pollination. Its leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of numerous narrow, glossy leaflets.</p>
<p>Cycas taiwaniana is characterized by its slow growth and is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage dating back to the Mesozoic era.</p>
