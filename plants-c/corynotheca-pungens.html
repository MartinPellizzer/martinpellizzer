                    <h1>Corynotheca pungens</h1>
<p>Corynotheca pungens, commonly known as the spiny rock cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Corynotheca pungens is often found growing on rocky substrates, showcasing its adaptability to extreme conditions.</p>
