                    <h1>Carex sinoaristata</h1>
<p>Carex sinoaristata, commonly known as the Chinese basket sedge, is a species of sedges native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
<p>Carex sinoaristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects.</p>
