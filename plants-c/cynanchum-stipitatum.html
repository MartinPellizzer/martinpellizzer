<p>Cynanchum stipitatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive corolla that resembles a shield, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it contains toxic compounds and is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes.</p>
