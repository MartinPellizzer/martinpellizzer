                    <h1>Cheilanthes fraseri</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's rockcap, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a unique ability to survive in harsh conditions due to its adaptations such as reduced leaf size and thick cuticle.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes fraseri is an important component of the local flora in its native range and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value.</p>
