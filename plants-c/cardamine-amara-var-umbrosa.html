                    <h1>Cardamine amara var. umbrosa</h1>
<p>Cardamine amara var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shadowy watercress, is a variant of the watercress species native to shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or stream-side habitats, where it thrives in cool, damp conditions. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, similar to other watercress varieties.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for shaded areas, it is often found in forest understories or along the edges of water bodies.</p>
