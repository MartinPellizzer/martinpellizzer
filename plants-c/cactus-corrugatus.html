                    <h1>Cactus corrugatus</h1>
<p>Cactus corrugatus, commonly known as the ridged cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed stems that are often covered in spines and are adapted for water storage. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by various insects and birds. Its succulent structure allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments by reducing water loss through its thick, waxy cuticle.</p>
<p>Cactus corrugatus plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for desert wildlife.</p>
