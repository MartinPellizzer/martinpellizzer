                    <h1>Chingia supraspinigera</h1>
<p>Chingia supraspinigera, commonly known as the golden spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are coated with a waxy cuticle, which reduces water loss and protects against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Chingia supraspinigera is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
