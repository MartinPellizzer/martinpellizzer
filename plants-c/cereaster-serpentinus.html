                    <h1>Cereaster serpentinus</h1>
<p>Cereaster serpentinus, commonly known as the serpentine aster, is a flowering plant native to the rocky, nutrient-poor soils of the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as limestone and serpentine outcrops, where it has adapted to low-nutrient conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The showy purple or blue flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
