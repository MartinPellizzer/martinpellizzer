                    <h1>Cymbochasma</h1>
<p>Cymbochasma, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly in regions of the Andes, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plants are characterized by their intricate, often fragrant flowers that display a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. Cymbochasma species are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they rely on specific environmental conditions for survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, many species within this genus are threatened with extinction.</p>
