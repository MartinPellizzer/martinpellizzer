                    <h1>Cousinia lepida</h1>
<p>Cousinia lepida, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing plant with hairy stems and basal leaves that are usually oblanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense, terminal cluster, typically blooming in the spring. Its root system is extensive and adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Cousinia lepida is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in desert ecosystems.</p>
