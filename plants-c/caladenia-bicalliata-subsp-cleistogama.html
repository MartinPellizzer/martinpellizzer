<p>Caladenia bicalliata subsp.</p>
<p>cleistogama, commonly known as the Cleistogama Spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its unique, often greenish or brownish, hairy leaves and its striking, spider-like floral structure.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, erect flower spike with a single flower that is typically greenish-yellow in color. It is a rare and endangered species, with a limited distribution in the south-western region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>The subspecies is known for its cleistogamous pollination method, where flowers remain closed and self-pollinate, which is an adaptation to its specific ecological niche.</p>
