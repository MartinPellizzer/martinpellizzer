<p>Cladomyza kaniensis, commonly known as the Kaniensis thornplant, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater sources.</p>
<p>Cladomyza kaniensis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
