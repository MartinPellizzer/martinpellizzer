<p>Cyclosorus fraxinifolius, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, helping to stabilize stream banks and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bright yellow to golden in color, making it a striking addition to water gardens.</p>
