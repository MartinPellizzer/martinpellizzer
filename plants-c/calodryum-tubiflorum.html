<p>Calodryum tubiflorum, commonly known as the tuberous flowering plant, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>

The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, often arranged in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for horticultural purposes.</p>
