                    <h1>Cynorkis lemurica</h1>
<p>Cynorkis lemurica, commonly known as the moonlit orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the dense, humid rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blossoms that bloom at night. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with specific species of fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption from the nutrient-poor soil. Its leaves are broad and glossy, adapted to capture maximum sunlight in its shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Cynorkis lemurica is classified as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
