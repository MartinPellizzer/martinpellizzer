                    <h1>Centropogon urubambae var. estrellanus</h1>
<p>Centropogon urubambae var. estrellanus, commonly known as the Estrellan mountain grass, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it adapts to cool and arid conditions. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, producing delicate white or pale blue flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant species for ecological studies in mountainous ecosystems.</p>
