The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of white, pink, or purple. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden cultivation.</p>
<p>Its vigorous growth habit requires support structures, such as trellises or fences, for optimal display.</p>
