<p>Calandrinia vinulosa, commonly known as the redstem sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to quickly absorb surface moisture after rainfall.</p>
<p>Calandrinia vinulosa is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
