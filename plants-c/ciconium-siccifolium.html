<p>Ciconium siccifolium, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Ciconium siccifolium is well adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone climates.</p>
