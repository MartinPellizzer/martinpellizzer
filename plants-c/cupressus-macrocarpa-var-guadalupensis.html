                    <h1>Cupressus macrocarpa var. guadalupensis</h1>
<p>Cupressus macrocarpa var. guadalupensis, commonly known as the Mexican redcedar, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and scaly, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are scale-like and closely pressed to the branches, giving the tree a smooth, textured appearance. It produces small, spherical cones that are typically retained on the tree for several years.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
