                    <h1>Campanula elatina</h1>
<p>Campanula elatina, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Campanula elatina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine setting.</p>
