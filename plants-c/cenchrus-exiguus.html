                    <h1>Cenchrus exiguus</h1>
<p>Cenchrus exiguus, commonly known as slender sand grass, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial plant with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and resistance to grazing. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sandy soils, making it ecologically significant in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Cenchrus exiguus is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to reclaim disturbed soils and prevent erosion.</p>
