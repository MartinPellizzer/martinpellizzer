                    <h1>Cardamine asarifolia var. hirsuta</h1>
<p>Cardamine asarifolia var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with a waxy, hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in moist environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which sets it apart from other Cardamine species.</p>
