                            <h1>Carlina Vulgaris Var. Uniflora</h1>
<p>Carlina vulgaris var. uniflora is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Pyrenees and surrounding regions. It is known for its distinctive blue or purple flower heads that stand out against the rugged mountain landscape. This variety is a lesser-known cousin of the more common Carlina vulgaris, which is often found in alpine meadows. Its unique appearance makes it a favorite among botanists and wildflower enthusiasts. The plant thrives in cold, dry environments and is a symbol of the resilience of flora in harsh conditions.</p>
