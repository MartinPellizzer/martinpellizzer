<p>Chaptalia runcinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chaptalia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
