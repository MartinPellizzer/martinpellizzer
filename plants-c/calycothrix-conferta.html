<p>Calycothrix conferta, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and often clustered, with the bladders embedded in the leaf axils.</p>
<p>Calycothrix conferta plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
