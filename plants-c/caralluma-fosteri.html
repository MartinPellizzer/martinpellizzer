                    <h1>Caralluma fosteri</h1>
<p>Caralluma fosteri, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its spine-like stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its leaves are typically reduced to small spines, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Caralluma fosteri is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
