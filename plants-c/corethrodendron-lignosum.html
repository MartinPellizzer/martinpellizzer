                <h1>Corethrodendron lignosum</h1>
<p>Corethrodendron lignosum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits containing flat, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its natural habitat.</p>
