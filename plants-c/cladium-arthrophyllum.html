                    <h1>Cladium arthrophyllum</h1>
<p>Cladium arthrophyllum, commonly known as the sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss in its moist environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to the structure of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Cladium arthrophyllum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland species.</p>
