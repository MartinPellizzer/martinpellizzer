<p>Cyperus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf sedgeland, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically forms dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. It thrives in wet or moist soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, it is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
