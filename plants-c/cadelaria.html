                    <h1>Cadelaria</h1>
<p>Cadelaria, commonly known as the "false dandelion," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species that are native to various regions of Africa, particularly in the southern part of the continent. These plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped or ovate, and they produce small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Cadelaria species are often found in open, grassy areas and are adapted to dry or semi-arid conditions.</p>
<p>They are not commonly cultivated but are of interest to botanists due to their unique morphology and ecological roles.</p>
