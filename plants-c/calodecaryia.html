                    <h1>Calodecaryia</h1>
<p>Calodecaryia, commonly known as the "ghost orchid," is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Calodecaryia has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
