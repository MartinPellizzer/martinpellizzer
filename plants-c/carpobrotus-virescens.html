                    <h1>Carpobrotus virescens</h1>
<p>Carpobrotus virescens, commonly known as African ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, prostrate stems and thick, oval-shaped leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils make it both a valuable pioneer species and a potential invasive plant in non-native regions.</p>
<p>The leaves and flowers are edible, often used in local cuisines for their mild, tangy flavor.</p>
