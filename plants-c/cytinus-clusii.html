                    <h1>Cytinus clusii</h1>
<p>Cytinus clusii, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on its host for water and nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, swollen stem and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to southern Europe and North Africa, it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can be invasive in certain regions, impacting native plant communities.</p>
