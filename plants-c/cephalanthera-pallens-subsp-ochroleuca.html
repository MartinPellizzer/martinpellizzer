<p>Cephalanthera pallens subsp.</p>
<p>ochroleuca, commonly known as the white helleborine, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its pale green to white flowers. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and forest edges.</p>
<p>The plant has a short rhizome and produces a single, erect stem bearing several showy, hooded flowers. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged in a rosette at the base of the stem.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to photosynthesize, as it lacks the typical mycorrhizal associations found in many orchids.</p>
