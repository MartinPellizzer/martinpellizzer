                    <h1>Cinchona sanctae-luciae</h1>
<p>Cinchona sanctae-luciae, commonly known as the San Luis cinchona, is a species of evergreen tree native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain elliptical seeds. It is notable for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of quinine, which has historically been used to treat malaria.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated than other cinchona species due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
