                    <h1>Cyathea costalis</h1>
<p>Cyathea costalis, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found near coastal areas or in moist forests. Its rhizomes produce new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
