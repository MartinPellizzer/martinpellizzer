                    <h1>Cystopus uniflorus</h1>
<p>Cystopus uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flower bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient absorption. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, often blooming in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Despite its simple appearance, Cystopus uniflorus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
