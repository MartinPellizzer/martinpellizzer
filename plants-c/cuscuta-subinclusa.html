<p>Cuscuta subinclusa, commonly known as the lesser dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive appearance with thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is often found growing on grasses, sedges, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
