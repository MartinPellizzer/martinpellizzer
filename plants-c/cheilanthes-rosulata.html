<p>Cheilanthes rosulata, commonly known as the rosette fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like arrangement of lanceolate, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of whitish tomentum. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is a perennial, with a short, rhizomatous stem that produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
