                    <h1>Caralluma foetida</h1>
<p>Caralluma foetida, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and moths. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Caralluma foetida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to low-water conditions.</p>
