<p>Carex hornschuchiana subsp.</p>
<p>subsalsa, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It has narrow, grassy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems.</p>
