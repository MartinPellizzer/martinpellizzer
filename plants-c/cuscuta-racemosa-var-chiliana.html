                    <h1>Cuscuta racemosa var. chiliana</h1>
<p>Cuscuta racemosa var. chiliana, commonly known as the Chilean dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. The plant has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host, forming a dense network. It is native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina, and thrives in dry, arid environments.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively.</p>
