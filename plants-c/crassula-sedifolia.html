<p>Crassula sedifolia, commonly known as the fleshy leaf crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the growing season. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in full sun and well-draining soil makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
