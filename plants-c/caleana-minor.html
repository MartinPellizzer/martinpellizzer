<p>Caleana minor, commonly known as the lesser bird's-beak orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, bird-like flower that resembles a beak, with a bright red or orange tip. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. It produces a single, narrow leaf and has a delicate, ephemeral blooming period during the late winter to early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions.</p>
