<p>Cyperus niveus, commonly known as the snow flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or white, arranged in spikelets along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Cyperus niveus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
