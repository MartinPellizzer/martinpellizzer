<p>Crocus serotinus subsp.</p>
<p>asturicus, commonly known as the Asturian crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its early spring blooming habit, with violet-blue flowers that appear before the leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, preferring well-drained, calcareous soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, tuberous bulbs that help it survive in its native environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity.</p>
