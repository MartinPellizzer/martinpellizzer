<p>Cochemiea mainiae, commonly known as the Mainia's cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in clusters of small, pale green to yellow spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a striking contrast to its arid environment. Cochemiea mainiae is well adapted to dry climates, storing water in its succulent stems and thriving in full sun.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
