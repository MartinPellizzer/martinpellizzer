                    <h1>Coffea canephora var. muniensis</h1>
<p>Coffea canephora var. muniensis, commonly known as Muniensis coffee, is a lesser-known variety of the robusta coffee species.</p>
<p>It originates from the Muni region in CÃ´te d'Ivoire and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, oval-shaped berries that turn red when mature, each containing two seeds used for coffee production. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited cultivation, it is relatively rare in the global coffee market.</p>
