<p>Cryptandra sieberi var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cryptandra, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its slender, angular stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for native pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
