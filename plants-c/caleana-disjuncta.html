<p>Caleana disjuncta, commonly known as the Disjunct Spider-Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with a slender, curved labellum that mimics the shape of an insect. The plant typically grows in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually a striking combination of red and yellow, with a distinctive, elongated structure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
