<p>[WRONG START] Cupressus duclouxiana subsp.</p>
<p>austrotibetana, commonly known as the Tibetan Chinese fir, is a rare and endemic coniferous species native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and western Sichuan in China. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and dark green, needle-like foliage.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in cool, moist mountainous environments, often at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its cones are small and woody, containing winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
