<p>Campanula subidaea, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine meadows where it tolerates cold temperatures and strong winds. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to minimize water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Campanula subidaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
