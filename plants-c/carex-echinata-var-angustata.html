                    <h1>Carex echinata var. angustata</h1>
<p>Carex echinata var. angustata, commonly known as narrow-leaved bulblet sedge, is a perennial plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
