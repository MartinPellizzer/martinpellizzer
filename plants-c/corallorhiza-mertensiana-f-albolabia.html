                    <h1>Corallorhiza mertensiana f. albolabia</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza mertensiana f. albolabia, commonly known as the white-labied coralroot, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for nutrients. The plant produces showy, coral-like flowers with white or pale yellow petals and a distinctive, labiate (lip) structure. Its roots are specialized to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which supply the plant with essential nutrients.</p>
<p>This unique botanical adaptation allows it to thrive in shaded, moist forest environments where light is limited.</p>
