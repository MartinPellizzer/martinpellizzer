                    <h1>Carex unciniiformis</h1>
<p>Carex unciniiformis, commonly known as the hooked sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Carex unciniiformis is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>Its unique hooked bracts distinguish it from other sedge species and contribute to its ecological significance.</p>
