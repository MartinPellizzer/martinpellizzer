                    <h1>Cactus octogonus</h1>
<p>Cactus octogonus, commonly known as the eight-armed cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, radial arrangement of spiny stems that form a star-like shape, giving it its common name. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers, which appear in late spring, are typically yellow or orange and are pollinated by nocturnal insects.</p>
<p>The cactus is adapted to extreme temperatures and requires minimal water, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
