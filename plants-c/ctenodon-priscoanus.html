                    <h1>Ctenodon priscoanus</h1>
<p>Ctenodon priscoanus, commonly known as the ancient spiny scale, is a rare and enigmatic plant species characterized by its unique morphological features.</p>
<p>It possesses a robust, spiny stem covered in dense, overlapping scales that provide protection against herbivory and environmental stress. The plant exhibits a succulent habit, storing water in its thickened stems to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often reduced, adapting to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Despite its botanical intrigue, Ctenodon priscoanus remains poorly understood due to its limited distribution and scarcity in the wild.</p>
