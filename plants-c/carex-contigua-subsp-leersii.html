<p>Carex contigua subsp.</p>
<p>leersii, commonly known as the slender sedges, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and spikelet-based inflorescences. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream edges, preferring full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a triangular cross-section, a common feature among sedges. Its flowering spikes are usually compact and contain small, three-ranked flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and ability to stabilize soil in waterlogged environments.</p>
