                            <h1>Canavalia Virosa</h1>
<p>Velvet bean, scientifically known as Canavalia virosa, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety stems and trifoliate leaves that give it its common name. This plant is widely cultivated for its edible seeds, which are used in various cuisines around the world. Additionally, it plays an important role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing properties. However, it also contains toxic compounds that require careful handling and preparation.</p>
