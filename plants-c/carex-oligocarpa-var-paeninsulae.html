                    <h1>Carex oligocarpa var. paeninsulae</h1>
<p>Carex oligocarpa var. paeninsulae, commonly known as the Peninsula sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along the edges of tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and more compact growth form compared to the typical Carex oligocarpa.</p>
