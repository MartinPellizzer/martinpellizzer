                    <h1>Ceratozamia delucana</h1>
<p>Ceratozamia delucana, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Ceratozamia delucana is considered vulnerable to extinction.</p>
