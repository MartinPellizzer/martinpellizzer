<p>Cuscuta monogyna subsp.</p>
<p>esquamata, commonly known as the silver dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow or white flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts.</p>
<p>The subspecies is characterized by its finely scaled, silver-gray stems, which give it its common name. It typically grows on a variety of herbaceous plants, often found in disturbed soils or along field edges.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves germinating seeds that attach to host plants, forming a parasitic relationship that can weaken or kill the host.</p>
