<p>Cinnagrostis leiophylla, commonly known as the smooth leaf cinnagrostis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and smooth, giving it the common name, while its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cinnagrostis leiophylla is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
