                    <h1>Croton leonis</h1>
<p>Croton leonis, commonly known as the lion's tail, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that resemble a lion's tail, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by bright orange or red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity should be noted.</p>
