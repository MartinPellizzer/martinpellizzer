                    <h1>Caulinia fragilis</h1>
<p>Caulinia fragilis, commonly known as the brittle caulinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a low shrub, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters, and thrives in well-drained soils. Its fragility is evident in its thin stems, which easily break, and its flowers that wilt quickly after blooming.</p>
<p>Caulinia fragilis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often going dormant during periods of extreme drought.</p>
