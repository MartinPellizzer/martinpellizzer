                    <h1>Craterosiphon scandens var. scandens</h1>
<p>Craterosiphon scandens var. scandens, commonly known as the creeping rockweed, is a marine green alga that thrives in intertidal zones.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its filamentous growth habit and the presence of air bladders that help it float and remain buoyant. The plant has a simple morphology with a central axis and lateral branches, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. It is often found attached to rocks or other substrates in shallow coastal waters.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate fluctuating salinity and temperature makes it a resilient species in dynamic marine environments.</p>
