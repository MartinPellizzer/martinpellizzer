<p>Calyptranthes pseudomoaensis, commonly known as the Maui mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests, where it thrives in humid conditions. It produces yellowish-green flowers that are often obscured by bracts, making it less conspicuous to the untrained eye.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
