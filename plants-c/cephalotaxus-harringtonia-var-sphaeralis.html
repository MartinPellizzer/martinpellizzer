                    <h1>Cephalotaxus harringtonia var. sphaeralis</h1>
<p>Cephalotaxus harringtonia var. sphaeralis, commonly known as the Harrington's yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to China.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded form with dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>However, like other yews, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
