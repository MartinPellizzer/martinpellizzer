                    <h1>Corybas simbuensis</h1>
<p>Corybas simbuensis, commonly known as the Sibuyan helmet orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its distinctive helmet-shaped flower, which is a key feature of the Corybas genus. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically dark-colored, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and overcollection.</p>
