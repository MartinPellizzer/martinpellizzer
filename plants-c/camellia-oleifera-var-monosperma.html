<p>Camellia oleifera var. monosperma, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, orange-red fruits that contain one or two seeds each. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions for its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
