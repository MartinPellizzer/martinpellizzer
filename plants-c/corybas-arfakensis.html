                    <h1>Corybas arfakensis</h1>
<p>Corybas arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfakensis hooded orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, hood-like floral structure that encloses the reproductive organs, a feature typical of the Corybas genus. The plant produces small, dark purple to black flowers that are highly specialized for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
