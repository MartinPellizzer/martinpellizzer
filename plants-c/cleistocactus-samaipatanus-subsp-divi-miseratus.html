<p>Cleistocactus samaipatanus subsp.</p>
<p>divi-miseratus, commonly known as the "sad devil" cactus, is a rare and striking species native to Bolivia. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white to pale blue spines.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that open only at night, a unique adaptation for pollination by nocturnal insects. It thrives in arid environments with well-drained soil and requires minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
