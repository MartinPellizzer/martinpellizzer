                    <h1>Cuscuta acutiflora</h1>
<p>Cuscuta acutiflora, commonly known as the sharp-flowered dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true leaves, stems, and roots.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to host plants using haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on a variety of herbaceous plants. It is native to North America and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants.</p>
