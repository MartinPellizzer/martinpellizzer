                    <h1>Cynometra americana</h1>
<p>Cynometra americana, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, though it is often used in traditional crafts and as a source of timber.</p>
