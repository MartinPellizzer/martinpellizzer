                    <h1>Ceratophyllum submersum var. spinosum</h1>
<p>Ceratophyllum submersum var. spinosum, commonly known as spiny watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, whorled leaves that are typically 2â€“4 mm in length. The plant produces tiny, reddish-brown flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often submerged or just below the water surface. It thrives in slow-moving to still waters with moderate to high light penetration.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
