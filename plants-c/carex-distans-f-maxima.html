                    <h1>Carex distans f. maxima</h1>
<p>Carex distans f. maxima, commonly known as the giant sedge, is a tall, perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its larger size compared to the typical form of Carex distans.</p>
