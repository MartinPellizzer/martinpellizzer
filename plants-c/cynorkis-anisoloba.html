<p>Cynorkis anisoloba, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, sandy soils. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk with a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are narrow and strap-like. Its reproductive structures include a cone-like structure that produces both male and female spores.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
