<p>Campyloneurum americanum, commonly known as the American groundhopper, is a small, creeping fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive, arching shape that gives it its scientific name. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in rows. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important component of its native ecosystem.</p>
