                    <h1>Ceropteris distans</h1>
<p>Ceropteris distans, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and swamps, where it forms dense floating mats. The plant has long, narrow fronds that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its rhizomes spread across the water surface, anchoring the plant and facilitating the growth of new fronds.</p>
<p>Ceropteris distans plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms.</p>
