<p>Clinostemon, commonly known as the "frost plant" or "desert bell," is a member of the Acanthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features upright, branched stems covered in dense, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers, which range from white to pink, are tubular and attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Clinostemon is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
