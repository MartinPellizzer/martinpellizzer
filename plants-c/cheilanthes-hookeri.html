                    <h1>Cheilanthes hookeri</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's rockcap, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America and the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often growing in crevices or on exposed rock faces. The plant has a short, thick rhizome with dense, leathery fronds that are typically evergreen. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes hookeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens due to its hardy nature.</p>
