                    <h1>Cuscuta ulicis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta ulicis, commonly known as common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize a wide range of host species. It is often found on plants in the legume family, such as vetch and clover.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation.</p>
