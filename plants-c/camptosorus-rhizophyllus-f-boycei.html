                    <h1>Camptosorus rhizophyllus f. boycei</h1>
<p>Camptosorus rhizophyllus f. boycei, commonly known as the Boyce's rock fern, is a rare and unique fern species characterized by its specialized adaptation to rocky environments.</p>
<p>It exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to anchor itself in crevices and soil pockets. The fronds are typically narrow and lanceolate, with a leathery texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, a feature common among ferns, and thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
