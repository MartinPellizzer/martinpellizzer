                    <h1>Cypripedium × aylingii</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × aylingii, commonly known as the Aylings' lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium pubescens.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip, which is a key feature of the lady's slipper orchid genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodlands and mountainous regions, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to anchor itself in soil while absorbing nutrients efficiently.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and rarity in the wild, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
