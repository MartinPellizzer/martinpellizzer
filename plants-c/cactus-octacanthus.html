                    <h1>Cactus octacanthus</h1>
<p>Cactus octacanthus, commonly known as the giant saguaro, is a towering cactus native to the Sonoran Desert of Arizona.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stem and distinctive branching structure that resembles an armadillo, hence its scientific name. The plant stores water in its fleshy stems and has spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. It blooms with large, white or yellow flowers during the spring, attracting pollinators like bats and birds.</p>
<p>The saguaro is a keystone species in its ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various desert wildlife.</p>
