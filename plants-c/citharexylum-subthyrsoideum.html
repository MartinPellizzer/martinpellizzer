                    <h1>Citharexylum subthyrsoideum</h1>
<p>Citharexylum subthyrsoideum, commonly known as the fragrant mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of trees, forming dense, evergreen shrubs with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by berries that are edible for some bird species. Its unique botanical structure allows it to derive moisture and nutrients from its host while also performing photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This species is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p>
