                    <h1>Cuscuta falkiiformis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta falkiiformis, commonly known as the Falkland Islands dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving both seed and vegetative propagation. The plant is native to the Falkland Islands and is adapted to grow on a variety of host plants, including grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or water, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Cuscuta falkiiformis plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
