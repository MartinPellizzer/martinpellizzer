                    <h1>Cardamine hirsuta var. prolifera</h1>
<p>Cardamine hirsuta var. prolifera, commonly known as the hairy watercress, is a variant of the broadleaf watercress.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features small, kidney-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. It produces white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in shaded, wet habitats such as stream banks and woodland edges.</p>
