<p>Cheilanthes castanea, commonly known as the chestnut fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in forested areas and along stream banks. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces fronds that are typically lance-shaped and have a leathery texture. Its spores are released from sori that are arranged in a single row along the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes castanea is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
