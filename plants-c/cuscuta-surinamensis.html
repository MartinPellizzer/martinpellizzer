                    <h1>Cuscuta surinamensis</h1>
<p>Cuscuta surinamensis, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has a vine-like structure with thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to tropical regions and is often found growing on plants such as cotton and beans. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to spread widely.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
