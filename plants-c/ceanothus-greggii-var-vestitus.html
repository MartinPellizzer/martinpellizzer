<p>Ceanothus greggii var. vestitus, commonly known as the silverleaf ceanothus, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping in arid regions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for native plant gardens.</p>
