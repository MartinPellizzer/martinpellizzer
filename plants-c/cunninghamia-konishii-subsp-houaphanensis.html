<p>Cunninghamia konishii subsp.</p>
<p>houaphanensis, commonly known as the Houaphanensis stone pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to northern Laos. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and can reach heights of up to 20 meters.</p>
<p>The plant produces cones that are typically 5â€“8 centimeters long, containing edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in whorls around the stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
