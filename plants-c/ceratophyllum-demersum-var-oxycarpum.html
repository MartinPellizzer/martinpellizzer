                    <h1>Ceratophyllum demersum var. oxycarpum</h1>
<p>Ceratophyllum demersum var. oxycarpum, commonly known as the spiked water-moss, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, dark green leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge from the water surface, often in clusters. It is a popular choice for pond and aquarium use due to its ability to oxygenate water and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth rate makes it both a valuable and sometimes invasive species in certain ecosystems.</p>
