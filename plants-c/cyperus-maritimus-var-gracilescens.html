                    <h1>Cyperus maritimus var. gracilescens</h1>
<p>Cyperus maritimus var. gracilescens, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal and wetland areas.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. The plant thrives in saline or brackish environments, making it a common sight in estuaries and tidal flats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and filter polluted water.</p>
