<p>Cyperus alatus subsp.</p>
<p>alatus, commonly known as the spineless flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its root system is fibrous, and it can spread through rhizomes, making it an aggressive colonizer in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
