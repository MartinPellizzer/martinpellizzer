<p>Calonemorchis dorrienii, commonly known as the Dorrien's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with elongated, translucent petals that resemble spectral forms. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the warmer months, often in shaded, humid environments. Calonemorchis dorrienii is a terrestrial orchid with a tuberous root system, adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
