                    <h1>Cotoneaster omissus</h1>
<p>Cotoneaster omissus, commonly known as the slender cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries that persist into winter. Cotoneaster omissus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a border plant.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant fall foliage and persistent fruit, which attract wildlife.</p>
