<p>Caprifolium elisae, commonly known as the Elisae honeysuckle, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Caprifoliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in shades of pale yellow to orange. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Caprifolium elisae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
