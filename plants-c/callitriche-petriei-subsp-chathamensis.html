<p>Callitriche petriei subsp.</p>
<p>chathamensis, commonly known as the Chatham Islands water-star, is a small aquatic plant native to the Chatham Islands of New Zealand. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches.</p>
<p>The plant has small, floating leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of the region and plays a role in supporting local aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
