<p>Cestichis pedicellaris, commonly known as the slender pedicellate orchid, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, elongated stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. Native to tropical regions of South America, this orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments within forest understories. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>
<p>The plant's unique pedicellate structure, where flowers are attached to short stalks, contributes to its distinctive appearance and ecological role in its habitat.</p>
