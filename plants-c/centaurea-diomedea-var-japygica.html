<p>Centaurea diomedea var. japygica, commonly known as the Mediterranean knapweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces striking purple to pinkish-blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
