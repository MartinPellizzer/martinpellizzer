<p>Carex bromoides subsp.</p>
<p>bromoides, commonly known as the common sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental potential in water gardens.</p>
