                    <h1>Cosmarium autumnale</h1>
<p>Cosmarium autumnale, commonly known as the autumn waterflea, is a freshwater green alga that thrives in temperate regions during the fall season.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spherical cells that often form colonies, and it typically inhabits still or slow-moving water bodies. The plant exhibits a unique life cycle that includes both motile and non-motile stages, with the latter forming resting spores to survive harsh environmental conditions. Cosmarium autumnale plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as a food source for microorganisms and small aquatic animals.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of water quality and seasonal changes in aquatic environments.</p>
