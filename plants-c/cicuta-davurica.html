                    <h1>Cicuta davurica</h1>
<p>Cicuta davurica, commonly known as water hemlock, is a highly toxic member of the carrot family (Apiaceae).</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet, disturbed soils along streambanks and marshes. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters. Its most distinguishing feature is the presence of hollow, slender stems with prominent nodes.</p>
<p>Due to its extreme toxicity, particularly from the compound cicutoxin, it is considered one of the most dangerous plants in North America.</p>
