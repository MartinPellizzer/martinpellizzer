<p>Cyathea minuta, commonly known as the small tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant is typically found growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its growth and allowing it to thrive in nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Cyathea minuta plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems.</p>
