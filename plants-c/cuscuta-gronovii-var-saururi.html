                    <h1>Cuscuta gronovii var. saururi</h1>
<p>Cuscuta gronovii var. saururi, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has a vine-like structure with tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found parasitizing various species of grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
