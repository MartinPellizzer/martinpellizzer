                    <h1>Cuscuta parviflora</h1>
<p>Cuscuta parviflora, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth rate, often forming dense mats on its host. The plant's stems are covered in tiny, adhesive structures that allow it to attach to and extract resources from its host. It is commonly found in agricultural fields and disturbed areas, where it can cause significant damage to crops.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in many regions.</p>
