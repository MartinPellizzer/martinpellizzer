<p>Cryptocentrum calcaratum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, intricate flower structure that resembles a miniature stone or rock, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers are often pale green or white, with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals that aid in pollination by specific insects.</p>
