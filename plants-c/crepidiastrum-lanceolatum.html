<p>Crepidiastrum lanceolatum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped, silver-green leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in the spring. Its fruits are berries that turn from green to red as they mature, and they are toxic to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Crepidiastrum lanceolatum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
