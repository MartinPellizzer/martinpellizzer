                    <h1>Cleistes speciosa</h1>
<p>Cleistes speciosa, commonly known as the showy cleistocarp, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Oenotheraceae family and is characterized by its unique, closed flowers that remain tightly shut throughout their blooming period. The plant produces small, egg-shaped fruits called cleistocarps, which open only after the seeds have matured. Cleistes speciosa thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
