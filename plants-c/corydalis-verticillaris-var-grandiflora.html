<p>Corydalis verticillaris var. grandiflora, commonly known as the grandiflora corydalis, is a flowering plant native to regions of Asia, including China and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, creeping stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces a unique type of seed pod known as a follicle, which splits open to release its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for both horticultural and traditional uses.</p>
