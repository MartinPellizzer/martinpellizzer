                    <h1>Calophyllum suriga</h1>
<p>Calophyllum suriga, commonly known as the Suriga or Philippine mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, glossy leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits containing several seeds. Its timber is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a significant species in local economies.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>
