                    <h1>Calodracon</h1>
<p>Calodracon, commonly known as the silverleaf cactus, is a unique desert plant characterized by its silvery, waxy foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant features spiny stems and produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb moisture from brief rainfalls.</p>
<p>Calodracon is well adapted to survive in extreme heat and drought conditions.</p>
