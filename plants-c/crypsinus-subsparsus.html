Native to the tropical regions of South America, this plant thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, which help protect it from excessive sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Crypsinus subsparsus is considered a difficult plant to cultivate outside its natural range.</p>
