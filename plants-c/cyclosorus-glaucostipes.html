                    <h1>Cyclosorus glaucostipes</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus glaucostipes, commonly known as the blue-stemmed water clover, is a rare aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, rounded leaves that form dense mats on the water surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating that gives them a bluish sheen.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality.</p>
