<p>Ctenitis mannii, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust, trunk-like stem covered in a thick, fibrous layer called the rachis. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Ctenitis mannii plays an important ecological role in humid, shaded environments by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability.</p>
