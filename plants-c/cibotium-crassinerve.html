<p>Cibotium crassinerve, commonly known as the broad-nerve tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, fibrous root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>Cibotium crassinerve plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
