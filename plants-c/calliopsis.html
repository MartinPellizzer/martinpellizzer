                    <h1>Calliopsis</h1>
<p>Calliopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Calliopsis has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
