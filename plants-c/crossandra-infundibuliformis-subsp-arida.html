<p>Crossandra infundibuliformis subsp.</p>
<p>arida, commonly known as the desert crossandra, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant orange to yellow flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping.</p>
