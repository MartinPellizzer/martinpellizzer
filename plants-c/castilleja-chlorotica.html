<p>Castilleja chlorotica, commonly known as the greenleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures, relying on host plants for water and nutrients. Its roots penetrate the roots of neighboring plants, forming a symbiotic relationship.</p>
<p>Castilleja chlorotica is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
