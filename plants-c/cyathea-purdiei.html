<p>Cyathea purdiei, commonly known as the Purdie's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots. The plant has large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, giving it a distinctive tropical appearance. Cyathea purdiei is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable component of New Zealand's native vegetation.</p>
