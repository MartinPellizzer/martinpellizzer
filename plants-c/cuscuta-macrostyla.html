                    <h1>Cuscuta macrostyla</h1>
<p>Cuscuta macrostyla, commonly known as the giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth rate, often covering its host in a dense, yellowish network of stems. The plant is native to North America and can be found on a variety of host species, including grasses and shrubs. Its life cycle involves germinating on a host, establishing a connection through specialized structures called haustoria, and then flowering and producing seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken or even kill its host plants.</p>
