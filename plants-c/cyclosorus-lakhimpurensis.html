                    <h1>Cyclosorus lakhimpurensis</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus lakhimpurensis, commonly known as the Lakhimpur water fern, is a rare aquatic fern species native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and wetlands. Its reproductive structures, including tiny submerged flowers, are adapted for water pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
