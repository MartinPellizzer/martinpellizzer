<p>Cheilanthes induta, commonly known as the rock fern or desert shield fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, drought-tolerant growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant has pinnately divided, evergreen fronds that are typically grayish-green in color, with a leathery texture that helps reduce water loss. It reproduces via spores, which are released from the underside of its fertile fronds.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes induta is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
