<p>It features small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, often silver-tomentose leaves that help reduce water loss in its cold, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species.</p>
