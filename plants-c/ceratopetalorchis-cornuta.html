                    <h1>Ceratopetalorchis cornuta</h1>
<p>Ceratopetalorchis cornuta, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure, with a prominent, horn-like spur that gives it its common name. Native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, this orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically pale green to yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ceratopetalorchis cornuta is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
