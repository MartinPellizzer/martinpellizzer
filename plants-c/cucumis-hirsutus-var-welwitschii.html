                    <h1>Cucumis hirsutus var. welwitschii</h1>
<p>Cucumis hirsutus var. welwitschii, commonly known as the Namibian cucumber, is a unique variant of the hairy cucumber species.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of Namibia and southern Angola, where it thrives in harsh, semi-desert environments. The plant is characterized by its small, spiny fruits and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in its dry habitat. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its adaptation strategies and potential for cultivation in similar climates.</p>
