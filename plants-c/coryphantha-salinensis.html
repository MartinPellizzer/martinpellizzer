                    <h1>Coryphantha salinensis</h1>
<p>Coryphantha salinensis, commonly known as the salt flat cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. Coryphantha salinensis is adapted to survive in saline and alkaline soils, making it a hardy plant in harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits reflect its evolutionary adaptations to extreme drought and high salinity conditions.</p>
