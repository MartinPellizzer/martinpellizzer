<p>Cattleya × dolosa f. coerulea, commonly known as the Blue Orchid, is a hybrid orchid prized for its striking blue to violet flowers.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. The plant typically grows as an epiphytic orchid, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its flowers are large, showy, and often have a fragrant scent, making it a popular choice for floral arrangements.</p>
<p>The unique coloration of its blooms is due to specific pigments and genetic traits inherited from its parent species.</p>
