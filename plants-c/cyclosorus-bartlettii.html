<p>Cyclosorus bartlettii, commonly known as the Bartlett's water clover, is a rare aquatic fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, rounded lobes, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique circular pattern along the margins of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus bartlettii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
