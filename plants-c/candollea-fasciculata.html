                    <h1>Candollea fasciculata</h1>
<p>Candollea fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or damp soil. The plant has simple, spirally arranged leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter in length. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its morphology reflects adaptations to its often harsh, humid habitats.</p>
<p>Candollea fasciculata is an important component of microhabitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
