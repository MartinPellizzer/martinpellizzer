                    <h1>Calopogon pallidus f. albiflorus</h1>
<p>Calopogon pallidus f. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered bog orchid, is a rare and striking variant of the pale pink bog orchid.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale white flowers, which stand out against its grass-like foliage. This plant is typically found in wetland habitats, such as bogs and marshes, where it thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the inflorescence consists of a single spike of flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
