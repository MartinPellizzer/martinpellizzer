<p>Calyptranthes angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf calyptranthes, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features elliptic to ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
