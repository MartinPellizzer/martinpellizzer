<p>Comanthera aciphylla, commonly known as the leafless mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead relies on its green stems for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked.</p>
