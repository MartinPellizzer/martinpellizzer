                    <h1>Carex tricephala</h1>
<p>Carex tricephala, commonly known as the three-headed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and pond edges, and is native to parts of North America. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually unisexual, with separate male and female structures, a common feature in the sedge family.</p>
