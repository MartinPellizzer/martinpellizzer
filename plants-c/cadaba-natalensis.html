                    <h1>Cadaba natalensis</h1>
<p>Cadaba natalensis, commonly known as Natal rock fig, is a small, evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
