<p>Cerastium arvense subsp.</p>
<p>alsinifolium, commonly known as creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a soft, hairy texture, and the flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its finely divided, almost grass-like leaves, distinguishing it from other members of the genus.</p>
