                    <h1>Cypripedium insigne var. forstermanii</h1>
<p>Cypripedium insigne var. forstermanii, commonly known as the Forsterman's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi that aid in nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its cool, humid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
