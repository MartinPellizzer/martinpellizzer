                    <h1>Coryphopteris gymnopoda var. gymnopoda</h1>
<p>Coryphopteris gymnopoda var. gymnopoda, commonly known as the naked-stemmed huperzia, is a fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and small, ovate leaves with a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the undersides of the leaves.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its lack of true roots and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
