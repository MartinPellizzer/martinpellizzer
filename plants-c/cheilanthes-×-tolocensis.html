                    <h1>Cheilanthes × tolocensis</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes × tolocensis, commonly known as the hybrid rock fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cheilanthes toloensis and Cheilanthes lindheimeri.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern that thrives in rocky, arid environments, often found in crevices and on limestone substrates. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered near the leaf tips.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry conditions.</p>
