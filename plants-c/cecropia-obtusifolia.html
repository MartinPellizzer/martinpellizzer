                    <h1>Cecropia obtusifolia</h1>
<p>Cecropia obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are grouped in clusters, followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. Cecropia obtusifolia is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is often found in disturbed habitats such as forest edges and clearings.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
