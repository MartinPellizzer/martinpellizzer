<p>Cardamine pratensis var. latifolia, commonly known as broad-leaved watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wet meadows and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features alternate, basal leaves that are broad and deeply lobed, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters atop slender stems. Its root system is fibrous, and it spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress.</p>
