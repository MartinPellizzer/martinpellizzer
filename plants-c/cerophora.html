                    <h1>Cerophora</h1>
<p>Cerophora, commonly known as the waxcap, is a genus of fungi that belongs to the family Hygrophoraceae.</p>
<p>These fungi are characterized by their waxy, often brightly colored caps and are typically found in grassy or heathland environments. Cerophora species are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with the roots of various plants, particularly grasses and sedges. They play an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil health.</p>
<p>Due to their unique appearance and habitat preferences, they are often indicators of undisturbed, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
