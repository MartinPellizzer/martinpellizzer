<p>Corybas cheesemanii, commonly known as the Cheeseman's helmet, is a rare and striking orchid native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flower that is typically green or yellowish in color. The plant produces a single, showy bloom that sits atop a slender stem, often emerging from the base of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
