                    <h1>Cheiranthus pumilus</h1>
<p>Cheiranthus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf wallflower, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found growing on slopes or in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and vibrant flowers, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements.</p>
