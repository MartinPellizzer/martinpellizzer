                    <h1>Condylocarpon</h1>
<p>Condylocarpon, commonly known as the sea lettuce, is a type of green algae that belongs to the family Ulvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, blade-like structure and is typically found in marine environments, especially in rocky intertidal zones. Condylocarpon thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and can form dense mats on coastal surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead has a thallus that absorbs nutrients directly from the water.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms.</p>
