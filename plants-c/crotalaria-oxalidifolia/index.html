                            <h1>Crotalaria Oxalidifolia</h1>
<p>Crotalaria oxalidifolia is a striking member of the legume family known for its vibrant yellow flowers and unique leaf structure. Native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia, this plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its name derives from the Greek words for "urine" and "leaf," hinting at its historical use in traditional medicine. The plant's rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. However, it contains toxic alkaloids, requiring caution in handling and cultivation.</p>
