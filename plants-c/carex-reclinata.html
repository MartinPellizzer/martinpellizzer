                    <h1>Carex reclinata</h1>
<p>Carex reclinata, commonly known as the drooping sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring grass-like leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces spikes of small, pale green to brownish flowers in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which helps stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
<p>Carex reclinata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions.</p>
