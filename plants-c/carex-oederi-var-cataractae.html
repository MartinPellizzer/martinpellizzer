The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which helps in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its aesthetic appeal in water garden settings.</p>
