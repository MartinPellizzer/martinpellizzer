                    <h1>Cladocolea diversifolia</h1>
<p>Cladocolea diversifolia, commonly known as the variable leaf lichen, is a unique species of lichen that exhibits a diverse range of morphological features.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its thallus, which is typically foliose in structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, enabling it to thrive in various environmental conditions. Cladocolea diversifolia is often found on bark, rocks, and soil surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its adaptability and variability in leaf morphology make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
