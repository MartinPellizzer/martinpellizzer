                    <h1>Cypripedium concolor var. godefroyae</h1>
<p>Cypripedium concolor var. godefroyae, commonly known as the Godefroy's yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy yellow pouch-shaped flower with a distinctive greenish throat and intricate veining. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and ovate, and it produces a single, elongated flowering stem each year.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variant is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
