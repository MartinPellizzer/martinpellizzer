<p>Cedrela ngobe, commonly known as the Ngobe mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central America, particularly found in countries like Panama and Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its straight-grained, reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and workability. The tree typically grows in lowland tropical forests and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, while its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, often clustered in panicles.</p>
<p>Due to overexploitation, Cedrela ngobe is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
