<p>Castanea floridana var. arcuata, commonly known as the Florida chestnut, is a rare and relict species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elongated nuts enclosed in spiny husks, and its leaves are typically elliptical with a serrated margin. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. It is closely related to other chestnut species but has distinct morphological features that set it apart.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
