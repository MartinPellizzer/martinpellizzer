                    <h1>Carex declinata</h1>
<p>Carex declinata, commonly known as the drooping sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a dense, bushy cluster at the base. Its flowering spikes are usually shorter than the leaves and produce small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Carex declinata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
