                    <h1>Cladium triglomeratum</h1>
<p>Cladium triglomeratum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow water. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Cladium triglomeratum plays an important ecological role in marsh ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in saturated soils makes it a key component of wetland vegetation.</p>
