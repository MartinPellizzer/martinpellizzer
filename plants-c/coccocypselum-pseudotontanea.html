<p>Coccocypselum pseudotontanea, commonly known as the coastal daisy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to saline and coastal conditions. It has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
