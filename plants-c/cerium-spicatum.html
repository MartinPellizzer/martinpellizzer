                    <h1>Cerium spicatum</h1>
<p>Cerium spicatum, commonly known as the spiky cerium, is a unique plant species characterized by its striking, spiky foliage.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, where it thrives in cool, humid climates. The plant's leaves are narrow and pointed, arranged in a dense, bushy structure that resembles a crown. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are small and clustered, often in shades of white and pale pink.</p>
<p>Due to its rare habitat and delicate nature, Cerium spicatum is considered a conservation concern.</p>
