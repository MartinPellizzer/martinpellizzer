                    <h1>Castilleja canescens</h1>
<p>Castilleja canescens, commonly known as the plains false Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange to red bract-like flowers that resemble those of the Indian paintbrush. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for nutrients, often attaching to grasses or shrubs via its haustoria. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe.</p>
<p>Castilleja canescens plays a role in pollination and serves as a food source for certain wildlife.</p>
