                    <h1>Calligonum pappii var. aciculatum</h1>
<p>Calligonum pappii var. aciculatum, commonly known as the needleleaf tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in degraded landscapes.</p>
