                    <h1>Chabertia freynii</h1>
<p>Chabertia freynii, commonly known as the Freyn's chabertia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, tufted foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or pale blue in color. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area.</p>
<p>Chabertia freynii plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying drought-resistant flora.</p>
