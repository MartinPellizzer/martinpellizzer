                    <h1>Centinodia arenaria</h1>
<p>Centinodia arenaria, commonly known as the sand centinodia, is a small, mat-forming succulent native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, greenish-yellow leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of xerophytic plants. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to absorb moisture from the surface layer of sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
