<p>Corycium bifidum, commonly known as the bifid corycium, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant features a slender, creeping rhizome and produces showy, fragrant blossoms with distinctive bifid (split) lips. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense clusters near the ground.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Corycium bifidum is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
