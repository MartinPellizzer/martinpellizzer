                    <h1>Convolvulus giganteus</h1>
<p>Convolvulus giganteus, commonly known as the giant morning glory, is a vigorous climbing vine native to South America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces large, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to cover structures make it both ornamental and invasive in some regions.</p>
<p>The flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name.</p>
