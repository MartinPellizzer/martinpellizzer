                <h1>Corispermum puberulum</h1>
<p>Corispermum puberulum, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a small annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy, pubescent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in small, spherical pods that split open when mature to release the seeds.</p>
<p>Corispermum puberulum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and efficient water conservation mechanisms.</p>
