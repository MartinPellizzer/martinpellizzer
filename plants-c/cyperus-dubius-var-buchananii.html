                    <h1>Cyperus dubius var. buchananii</h1>
<p>Cyperus dubius var. buchananii, commonly known as Buchanan's flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along water bodies, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-lobed flowers, which are often arranged in a single, terminal spike.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical Cyperus dubius, including variations in leaf structure and flowering patterns.</p>
