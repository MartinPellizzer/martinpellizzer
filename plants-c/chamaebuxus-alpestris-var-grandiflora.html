                    <h1>Chamaebuxus alpestris var. grandiflora</h1>
<p>Chamaebuxus alpestris var. grandiflora, commonly known as the Alpine bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and slightly waxy, adapted to harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense umbels. These flowers give way to bright red berries that are a food source for various birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at high altitudes.</p>
