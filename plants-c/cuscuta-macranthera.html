                    <h1>Cuscuta macranthera</h1>
<p>Cuscuta macranthera, commonly known as the giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth rate, often covering its host in a dense, tangled web of stems. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means, allowing it to colonize new areas quickly. It is found in various parts of the world, including North America, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken or even kill its host plants.</p>
