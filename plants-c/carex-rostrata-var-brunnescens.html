                    <h1>Carex rostrata var. brunnescens</h1>
<p>Carex rostrata var. brunnescens, commonly known as the brownish bristle sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>The varietal name "brunnescens" refers to its brownish coloration, particularly in the bracts and flowering structures.</p>
