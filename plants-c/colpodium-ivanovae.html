<p>Colpodium ivanovae, commonly known as the Ivanov's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its leaves are slender and often spiral around the stem, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually pale green or yellow.</p>
<p>Colpodium ivanovae plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling through its predatory behavior.</p>
