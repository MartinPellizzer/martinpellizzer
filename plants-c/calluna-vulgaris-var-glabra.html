                    <h1>Calluna vulgaris var. glabra</h1>
<p>Calluna vulgaris var. glabra, commonly known as the glabrous heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, though the 'glabra' variety lacks these hairs, giving it a smooth appearance. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>
