<p>Conophytum plenum, commonly known as the full-bodied conophytum, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its compact form. Its unique leaf structure and ability to thrive in well-drained soil make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Conophytum plenum is also known for its ability to form dense clusters over time, creating an attractive, low-maintenance landscape feature.</p>
