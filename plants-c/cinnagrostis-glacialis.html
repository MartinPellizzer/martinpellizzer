<p>Cinnagrostis glacialis, commonly known as glacierweed, is a flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Glacierweed plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small Arctic fauna.</p>
