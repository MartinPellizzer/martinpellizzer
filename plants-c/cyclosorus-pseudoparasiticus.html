                    <h1>Cyclosorus pseudoparasiticus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus pseudoparasiticus, commonly known as the false parasitic liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thalloid structure and is typically found growing on the surfaces of other plants, such as tree trunks or branches. This plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, relying instead on its flattened, ribbon-like body to absorb nutrients from its host. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with decaying wood or bark.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic-like growth habit, it plays a unique role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
