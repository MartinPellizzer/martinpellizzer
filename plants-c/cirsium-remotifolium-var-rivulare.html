                    <h1>Cirsium remotifolium var. rivulare</h1>
<p>Cirsium remotifolium var. rivulare, commonly known as the river thistle, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands and riverbanks of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, purple-tinged flower heads that bloom in late summer. The leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine, bristly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its moist habitat. It prefers full sun to partial shade and thrives in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in riparian zones and is an important plant for local pollinators.</p>
