                    <h1>Circaea decumbens</h1>
<p>Circaea decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate twinflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms a dense mat of wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, creating a carpet-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, with five petals and a prominent central column. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Circaea decumbens thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
