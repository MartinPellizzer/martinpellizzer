                    <h1>Castilleja angustifolia var. abbreviata</h1>
<p>Castilleja angustifolia var. abbreviata, commonly known as the narrowleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange bract-like flowers that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb nutrients from host plants, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
