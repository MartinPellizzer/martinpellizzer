                    <h1>Carya aquatica</h1>
<p>Carya aquatica, commonly known as the water hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by oval, green-to-brown nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. Its seeds are dispersed by water, as the fruit floats, allowing the plant to colonize wetland areas.</p>
<p>Carya aquatica is often found in swamps, river valleys, and other moist habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments.</p>
