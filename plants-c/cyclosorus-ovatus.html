                    <h1>Cyclosorus ovatus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus ovatus, commonly known as the broad-leafed water clover, is a species of aquatic fern native to freshwater environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, creeping rhizomes that root at the nodes and produce small, ovate, floating leaves. The leaves are typically 2-4 cm in length and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still waters, often forming dense mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
