                    <h1>Conocarpus pubescens</h1>
<p>Conocarpus pubescens, commonly known as the mangrove apple or white mangrove, is a salt-tolerant tree native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss and salt accumulation. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that contain numerous seeds. Its roots often form dense networks that stabilize coastal sediments and provide habitat for marine life.</p>
<p>Conocarpus pubescens plays a vital role in protecting shorelines from erosion and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
