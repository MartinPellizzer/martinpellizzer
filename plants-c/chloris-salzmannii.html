                    <h1>Chloris salzmannii</h1>
<p>Chloris salzmannii, commonly known as saltbush or saltgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass with small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces tiny, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in spring. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to saline soils and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Chloris salzmannii plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in dry regions.</p>
