                    <h1>Cereus thelegonus</h1>
<p>Cereus thelegonus, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its segmented stems that form a branching structure. The plant produces showy, vibrant flowers that typically bloom during the holiday season, hence its common name. Its leaves are modified into flattened, fleshy structures that store water, a typical adaptation for arid environments.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually red, pink, or white, and they open in the evening, making it a nocturnal bloomer.</p>
