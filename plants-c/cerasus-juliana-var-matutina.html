<p>Cerasus juliana var. matutina, commonly known as the Japanese early cherry or matutina cherry, is a compact, ornamental shrub native to Japan.</p>
<p>It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom very early in the spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has a rounded form with dense, dark green foliage that provides a striking contrast to its delicate blossoms. It is prized for its early flowering habit and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically followed by small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.</p>
