<p>Cymbanthes foetida, commonly known as the stinking bellflower, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bell-shaped, often purple or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Its name derives from the strong, unpleasant odor it emits, which is thought to attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and the plant is generally short-lived, often appearing as a biennial or perennial depending on the region.</p>
