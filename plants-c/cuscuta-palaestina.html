                    <h1>Cuscuta palaestina</h1>
<p>Cuscuta palaestina, commonly known as the Palestinian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to the Middle East and parts of Europe, often found on crops such as barley and wheat. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread across different regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops.</p>
