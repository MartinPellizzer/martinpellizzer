<p>Cissus gossypiifolia, commonly known as the ice plant or snow vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits resembling small grapes. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>It is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in warm, sunny conditions.</p>
