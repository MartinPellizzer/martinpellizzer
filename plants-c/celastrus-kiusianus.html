                    <h1>Celastrus kiusianus</h1>
<p>Celastrus kiusianus, commonly known as the Japanese staffvetch, is a deciduous climbing vine native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. The plant bears orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it both a horticultural interest and an invasive species in some regions.</p>
