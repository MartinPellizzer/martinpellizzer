<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit also makes it effective for erosion control on slopes and banks.</p>
