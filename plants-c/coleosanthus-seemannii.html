<p>Coleosanthus seemannii, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a tall, evergreen fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. The plant produces large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 5 meters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its ability to regenerate from its rhizome, allowing it to persist through environmental disturbances.</p>
