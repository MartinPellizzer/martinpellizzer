                    <h1>Camaridium amparoanum</h1>
<p>Camaridium amparoanum, commonly known as the Amparo orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the cloud forests of the Andes, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant features intricate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern that ranges from deep violet to pale lavender. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil of its high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
