                    <h1>Clitandra indeniensis</h1>
<p>Clitandra indeniensis, commonly known as the KwaZulu-Natal ironwood, is a rare and critically endangered tree species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and robust, often twisted trunk. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an important component of its native ecosystem. It produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that attract various bird species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
