<p>Chasmone crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved chasmone, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its growth habit is low and mat-forming, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Chasmone crassifolia is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water once established.</p>
