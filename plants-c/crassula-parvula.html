                    <h1>Crassula parvula</h1>
<p>Crassula parvula, commonly known as the baby chain plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a houseplant due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Crassula parvula prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
