<p>Carex rigida f. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf sedges, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stiff, grass-like leaves that are broader than those of typical sedges, often reaching widths of up to 1 centimeter. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters, with the inflorescence often appearing as a dense, cylindrical structure.

<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland habitats.</p>
