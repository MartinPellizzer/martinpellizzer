<p>Calodonta, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with a specific type of fungus, which provides it with essential nutrients. Calodonta lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
