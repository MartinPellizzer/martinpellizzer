<p>Cyperus ischnostachys, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed flatsedge, is a species of sedge native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can influence local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Cyperus ischnostachys plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
