                            <h1>Cotyledon Secunda</h1>
<p>Cotyledon secunda is a striking succulent native to southern Africa known for its vibrant, often variegated leaves. This plant belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements. Its fleshy leaves are adapted to store water, making it ideal for arid environments. It thrives in bright light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts. Despite its beauty, Cotyledon secunda is relatively rare in the wild, prompting many to cultivate it at home.</p>
