                    <h1>Cuscuta patens</h1>
<p>Cuscuta patens, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive network of thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread to new hosts. It is found in various regions worldwide and can infest a wide range of agricultural and ornamental plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and reduce their yield.</p>
