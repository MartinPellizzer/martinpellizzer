                    <h1>Cheilanthes integerrima</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes integerrima, commonly known as the rock fern or cliff brake, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically gray-green in color and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in rocky crevices and exposed soils, demonstrating remarkable drought tolerance. Its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes integerrima is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance.</p>
