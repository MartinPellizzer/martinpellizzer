<p>Coffea melanocarpa, commonly known as the black coffee bean tree, is a species native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows to a height of 2â€“5 meters. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits containing dark brown seeds. These seeds, while not widely cultivated for commercial coffee, are sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
