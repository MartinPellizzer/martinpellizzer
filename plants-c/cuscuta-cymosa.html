                    <h1>Cuscuta cymosa</h1>
<p>Cuscuta cymosa, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers and has a tangled, vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant is native to North America and can be found growing on a variety of host plants, including grasses and forbs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
