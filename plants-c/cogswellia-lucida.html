<p>Cogswellia lucida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale green, leaf-like structures that resemble leaves but are actually modified stems. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
