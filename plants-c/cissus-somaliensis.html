                    <h1>Cissus somaliensis</h1>
<p>Cissus somaliensis, commonly known as the Somali grape ivy, is a climbing plant native to the arid regions of the Horn of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and small, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers followed by edible berries that are often used in local cuisines. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in dry climates.</p>
