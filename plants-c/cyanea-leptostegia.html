<p>Cyanea leptostegia, commonly known as the Hawaiian sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the tropical climate of Hawaii. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid coastal habitat.</p>
