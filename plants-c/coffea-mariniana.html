                    <h1>Coffea mariniana</h1>
<p>Coffea mariniana, commonly known as the island coffee or maritime coffee, is a rare and lesser-known species of coffee native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped berries that contain two seeds, which are used for coffee production. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the tropical rainforests of its native habitat. It has dark green, glossy leaves and produces white flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coffea mariniana is considered a unique and ecologically significant species.</p>
