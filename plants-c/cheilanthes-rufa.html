                    <h1>Cheilanthes rufa</h1>
<p>Cheilanthes rufa, commonly known as the red-stemmed rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and serrated, leathery fronds that are typically reddish-brown in color. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is often found growing on limestone or sandstone outcrops. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in harsh environments.</p>
