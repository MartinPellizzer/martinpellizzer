<p>Ctenodon afranianus, commonly known as the African flatworm plant, is a unique species native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a type of liverwort, belonging to the family Porellaceae, and is characterized by its simple, flat, and leaf-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or tree trunks. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is often found in specific microhabitats where humidity and moisture levels are consistently high.</p>
