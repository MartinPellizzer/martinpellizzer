                    <h1>Chenopodiopsis chenopodioides</h1>
<p>Chenopodiopsis chenopodioides, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, dry fruits called achenes. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments.</p>
