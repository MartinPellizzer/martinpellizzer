                    <h1>Clematis montana var. brevifoliola</h1>
<p>Clematis montana var. brevifoliola, commonly known as the compact Clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, ovate leaves that are smaller than those of the typical montana variety, giving it a more delicate appearance. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a compact, ornamental vine.</p>
<p>Its vigorous growth habit requires support, such as trellises or fences, to showcase its beauty effectively.</p>
