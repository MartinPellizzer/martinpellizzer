                    <h1>Chloraster oblitteratus</h1>
<p>Chloraster oblitteratus, commonly known as the ghost sponge, is a unique marine sponge found in tropical and subtropical waters.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Halichondriidae and is characterized by its translucent, gelatinous body that appears almost invisible in water. The sponge lacks traditional pores and has a distinctive structure composed of a network of thin, branching filaments. It is known for its ability to filter large amounts of water to extract nutrients, contributing to its ecological role in marine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile nature, it is often overlooked but plays a significant part in benthic communities.</p>
