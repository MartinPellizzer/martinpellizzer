                    <h1>Cocos aricui</h1>
<p>Cocos aricui, commonly known as the West Indian coconut, is a tropical palm native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces coconuts that are typically smaller and have a sweeter, more delicate flavor compared to the common coconut. Its fruit is enclosed in a fibrous husk and contains a white, fleshy aril around the hard inner shell.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for both its fruit and ornamental value.</p>
