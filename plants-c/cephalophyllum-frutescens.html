<p>Cephalophyllum frutescens, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, succulent plant characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring.

It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments.</p>
