                    <h1>Calamagrostis densa</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis densa, commonly known as dense reedgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often silver-gray in color. The plant produces tall, slender panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet soils, making it a common sight in marshy areas and along waterways.</p>
<p>Calamagrostis densa is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments.</p>
