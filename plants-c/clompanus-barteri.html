<p>Clompanus barteri, commonly known as the Barter's clompanus, is a rare and specialized plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture that aids in moisture retention.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Clompanus barteri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
