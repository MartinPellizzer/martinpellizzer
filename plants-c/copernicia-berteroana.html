<p>Copernicia berteroana, commonly known as the wax palm, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean, particularly found in parts of Cuba, the Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by edible fruits that are consumed by various wildlife. It thrives in coastal and limestone-rich soils, and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often protected in conservation areas.</p>
