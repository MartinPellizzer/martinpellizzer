                    <h1>Cyrtococcum warburgii</h1>
<p>Cyrtococcum warburgii, commonly known as the Warburg's crust lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thin, leaf-like thallus with a distinctive, uneven margin. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and unique morphology make it a subject of interest in ecological and botanical studies.</p>
