                    <h1>Cuscuta planiflora var. abyssinica</h1>
<p>Cuscuta planiflora var. abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating on the surface of host plants. The plant's stems are filamentous and can缠绕 around host stems, forming a dense network. It is native to regions of Africa and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host species.</p>
