                    <h1>Crepis polymorpha var. stricta</h1>
<p>Crepis polymorpha var. stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, basal rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves and produces tiny, yellowish flowers in early summer. The plant is typically found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. It has a hairy stem and is often mistaken for other similar species due to its compact growth habit.</p>
<p>The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
