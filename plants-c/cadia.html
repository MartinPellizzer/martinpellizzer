<p>Cadia, commonly known as the mountain cedar, is a deciduous tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cupressaceae family, which includes cypresses and junipers, and is characterized by its scale-like leaves and woody, aromatic bark. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Cadia is well adapted to dry climates, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in harsh, rocky environments.</p>
