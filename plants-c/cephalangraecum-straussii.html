                    <h1>Cephalangraecum straussii</h1>
<p>Cephalangraecum straussii, commonly known as the Schomburgkia, is a rare and striking member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the humid, shaded understories of tropical rainforests in South America, particularly in Brazil and Venezuela. The plant is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its often-dry environments. Its flowers are showy, with vibrant colors that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
