                    <h1>Castilleja steenensis</h1>
<p>Castilleja steenensis, commonly known as the Steen's Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange to red, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, often hairy stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted for parasitic growth on the roots of grasses and other plants. Castilleja steenensis typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands.</p>
<p>Its unique ecological role involves forming symbiotic relationships with host plants while contributing to the biodiversity of its native environment.</p>
