<p>Capsella bursa-pastoris rubella, commonly known as the red weed or common chickweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, three-lobed pods that resemble a shepherd's pouch, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common weed in many regions.</p>
