                    <h1>Caralluma indica</h1>
<p>Caralluma indica, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of India and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season, followed by capsule fruits containing elliptical seeds. Its leaves are typically reduced to small spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Caralluma indica is also known for its traditional use in Ayurvedic medicine for its purported appetite-suppressing properties.</p>
