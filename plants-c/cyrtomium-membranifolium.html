<p>Cyrtomium membranifolium, commonly known as the membranous fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a waxy, membranous texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Cyrtomium membranifolium is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
