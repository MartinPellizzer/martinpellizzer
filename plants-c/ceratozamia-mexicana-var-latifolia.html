                    <h1>Ceratozamia mexicana var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Ceratozamia mexicana var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are typically broad and have a distinctive dark green color with a waxy texture. This plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones rather than flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
