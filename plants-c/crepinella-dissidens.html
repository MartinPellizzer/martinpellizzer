<p>Crepinella dissidens, commonly known as the narrow-leafed thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features upright stems covered in dense, spiny leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, purple flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise harsh appearance. Its leaves are often divided into narrow segments, giving it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>Crepinella dissidens is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in sunny, open habitats.</p>
