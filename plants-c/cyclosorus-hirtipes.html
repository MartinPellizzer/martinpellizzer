<p>Cyclosorus hirtipes, commonly known as the hairy cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are well-developed, allowing it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and are a key feature for identification.</p>
