                            <h1>Cytisus Hirsutus Subsp. Elongatus</h1>
<p>Cytisus hirsutus subsp. elongatus is a lesser-known member of the legume family known for its distinctive appearance and ecological significance. This subspecies is characterized by its elongated leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to specific regions in southern Europe, it thrives in rocky and coastal environments. Despite its beauty, it remains underappreciated in horticultural circles. Understanding its biology and habitat is key to its conservation and potential use in landscaping.</p>
