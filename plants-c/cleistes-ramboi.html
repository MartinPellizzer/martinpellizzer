                    <h1>Cleistes ramboi</h1>
<p>Cleistes ramboi, commonly known as the violet bellflower, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its showy, violet-colored flowers that resemble small bells, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically ovate and covered in a fine, hairy texture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cleistes ramboi is considered a conservation concern.</p>
