<p>Chevaliera thyrsigera, commonly known as the thorned candelabra, is a striking member of the Apocynaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its branched, thorny stems that form a candelabra-like structure, giving it its common name. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, are clustered in umbels and are followed by distinctive, globose fruits.</p>
