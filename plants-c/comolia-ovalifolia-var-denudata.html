The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can tolerate periods of drought.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
