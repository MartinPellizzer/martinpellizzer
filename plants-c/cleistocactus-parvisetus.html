                    <h1>Cleistocactus parvisetus</h1>
<p>Cleistocactus parvisetus, commonly known as the small-armed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and short, spiny stems that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, a unique trait among cacti. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid gardens.</p>
