                    <h1>Carex divulsa var. congesta</h1>
<p>Carex divulsa var. congesta, commonly known as the clustered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, marshes, and wet meadows. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often obscured by its dense foliage, making it less showy than other sedges.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and is often found in association with other wetland plants.</p>
