                    <h1>Chloris humilis</h1>
<p>Chloris humilis, commonly known as slender grass or small bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland areas with well-drained conditions. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces tiny blue or purplish flowers, which are attractive to pollinators.</p>
<p>Chloris humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soils in erosion-prone environments.</p>
