<p>Cynodon dactylon subsp.</p>
<p>glabratus, commonly known as Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its coarse, dark green blades and dense, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to form a thick sod.</p>
<p>The plant has short, stiff leaves with prominent veins and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a common lawn and pasture grass.</p>
<p>Its ability to spread rapidly through both stolons and rhizomes contributes to its invasive potential in many regions.</p>
