<p>Collomia grandiflora f. axillaris, commonly known as the axillary collomia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its axillary flower clusters, which develop in the leaf axils, giving it its specific epithet.</p>
