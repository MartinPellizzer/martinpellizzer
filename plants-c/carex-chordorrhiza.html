                    <h1>Carex chordorrhiza</h1>
<p>Carex chordorrhiza, commonly known as the thread-root sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers, typically blooming in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which helps stabilize soil in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Carex chordorrhiza is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions and improve soil quality.</p>
