                    <h1>Cyperus hebes</h1>
<p>Cyperus hebes, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, swamps, and along waterways. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse via water or wind.</p>
<p>Cyperus hebes is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
