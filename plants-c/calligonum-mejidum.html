<p>Calligonum mejidum, commonly known as the Desert Hawthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, yellowish-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by orange to red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it a valuable species for stabilization of degraded lands.</p>
<p>Its resilience and ornamental qualities make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates.</p>
