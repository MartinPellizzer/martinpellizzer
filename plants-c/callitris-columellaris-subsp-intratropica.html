<p>Callitris columellaris subsp.</p>
<p>intratropica, commonly known as the coastal leatherwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen conifer native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and compact, conical shape, which helps it withstand coastal conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in horticulture for erosion control and ornamental purposes.</p>
