<p>Chenopodium harae, commonly known as the desert goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are often dispersed by animals or through wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or barren soils.</p>
<p>Chenopodium harae is adapted to thrive in harsh conditions, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
