<p>Cienkowskiella kirkii, commonly known as the Malawi orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Malawi.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often display a combination of purple, pink, and white hues. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its roots are adapted to anchor in crevices, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cienkowskiella kirkii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
