                    <h1>Cypripedium × bragaianum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × bragaianum, commonly known as the Braga hybrid lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
