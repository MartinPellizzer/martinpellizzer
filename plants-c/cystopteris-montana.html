<p>Cystopteris montana, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, round groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Cystopteris montana is often found growing in clusters, with its rhizomes spreading horizontally through the soil.</p>
