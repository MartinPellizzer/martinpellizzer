<p>Calendula amplexifolia, commonly known as the creeping calendula, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and orange or red petals, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Calendula amplexifolia is often used in ornamental gardening and has historical uses in herbal medicine.</p>
