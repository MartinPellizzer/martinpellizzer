<p>Carex carniolica, commonly known as the Carniolan sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.
