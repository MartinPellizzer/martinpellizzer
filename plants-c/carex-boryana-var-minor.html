                    <h1>Carex boryana var. minor</h1>
<p>Carex boryana var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an effective plant for erosion control.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in aquatic and riparian habitats.</p>
