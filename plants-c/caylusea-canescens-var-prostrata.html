<p>Caylusea canescens var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate silverleaf caylusea, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features silvery-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its stems are prostrate, spreading along the ground, which allows it to colonize rocky or sandy soils effectively.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun.</p>
