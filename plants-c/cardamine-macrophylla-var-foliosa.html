                    <h1>Cardamine macrophylla var. foliosa</h1>
<p>Cardamine macrophylla var. foliosa, commonly known as the broad-leaved water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features delicate, floating or submerged leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, typically appearing in early spring. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
