                    <h1>Cogswellia orogenioides</h1>
<p>Cogswellia orogenioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil, relying on atmospheric moisture and nutrients. The plant is characterized by its unique, waxy leaves and striking, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom infrequently. Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is listed as critically endangered.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this ethereal species from habitat destruction and climate change.</p>
