                    <h1>Cyclophorus acrostichoides var. fissus</h1>
<p>Cyclophorus acrostichoides var. fissus, commonly known as the fissured cyclophorus, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that exhibit a unique fissured pattern on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid and nutrient-rich soil. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that are clustered on the fronds, a feature typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
