                    <h1>Cheirostylis orobanchoides</h1>
<p>Cheirostylis orobanchoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that are often difficult to spot, contributing to its elusive nature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as critically endangered in many regions.</p>
