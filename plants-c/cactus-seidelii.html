                    <h1>Cactus seidelii</h1>
<p>Cactus seidelii, commonly known as the golden cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the cooler months, adding a striking visual element to its habitat. Its spines are modified leaves, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Cactus seidelii is well adapted to extreme temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
