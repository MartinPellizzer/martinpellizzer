<p>Cymbalariella scothophila, commonly known as the moonlight lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus with a distinctive, finely wrinkled surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which provide essential nutrients through photosynthesis and decomposition. It is typically found on decaying wood and stone in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
