<p>Cereus pacalaensis, commonly known as the Pachacamac cactus, is a species of cactus native to the coastal regions of Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, segmented structure, which helps it survive in arid environments. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming at night. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in conditions with limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
