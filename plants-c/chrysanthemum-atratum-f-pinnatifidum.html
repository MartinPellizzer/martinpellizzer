                    <h1>Chrysanthemum atratum f. pinnatifidum</h1>
<p>Chrysanthemum atratum f. pinnatifidum, commonly known as the blackleaf chrysanthemum, is a unique variant of the chrysanthemum genus characterized by its dark green to almost black foliage.</p>
<p>This plant is native to China and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking leaf coloration. The leaves are deeply lobed and pinnatifid, giving them a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the fall, adding a subtle contrast to its dark foliage.</p>
<p>While it is less commonly grown than other chrysanthemum varieties, it is prized in horticulture for its unusual aesthetic.</p>
