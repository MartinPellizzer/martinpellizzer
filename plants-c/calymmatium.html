<p>Calymmatium, commonly known as the "parrot's beak" cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America, particularly in countries like Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile. The plants are characterized by their tall, spiny stems and showy, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in the spring.
