<p>Castilleja paramensis, commonly known as the Paramo castilleja, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reddish-orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, high-altitude grasslands and cloud forests, where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are often reduced to small scales, and it relies on host plants for a significant portion of its nutrients.</p>
<p>Castilleja paramensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to floral diversity and supporting pollinators.</p>
