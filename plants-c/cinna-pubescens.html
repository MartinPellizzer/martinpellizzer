<p>Cinna pubescens, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy yellow flowers in early summer. Its flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and the plant is known for its fibrous, rhizomatous root system.</p>
<p>Cinna pubescens is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate waterlogged conditions.</p>
