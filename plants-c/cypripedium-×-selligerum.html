<p>Cypripedium × selligerum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium macranthon, resulting in a plant with distinctive, showy flowers that resemble a slipper. The plant features a tall, erect stem with a single, large, pouch-shaped flower that is typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
