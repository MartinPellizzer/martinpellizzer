                    <h1>Cystopus serriformis</h1>
<p>Cystopus serriformis, commonly known as the serrated bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water and has thin, branching stems covered in tiny, leaf-like structures. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually green or yellowish in color.</p>
<p>Cystopus serriformis is an important part of aquatic ecosystems, contributing to nutrient cycling through its predatory activity.</p>
