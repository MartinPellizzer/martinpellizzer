<p>Corallorhiza wyomingensis, commonly known as the Wyoming coralroot, is an orchid species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces a tall, slender stem with clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of healthy, undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
