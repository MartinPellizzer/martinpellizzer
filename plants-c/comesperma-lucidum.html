<p>Comesperma lucidum, commonly known as the shining mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also providing nectar for native birds and insects. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Comesperma lucidum plays a unique ecological role in its native habitat, supporting biodiversity through its mutualistic relationships.</p>
