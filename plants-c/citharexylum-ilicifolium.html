                    <h1>Citharexylum ilicifolium</h1>
<p>Citharexylum ilicifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it an important component of forest ecosystems in its native habitats.</p>
