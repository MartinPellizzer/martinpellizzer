                    <h1>Cuscuta orbiculata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta orbiculata, commonly known as the roundleaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating on the surface of host plants and then developing specialized structures to extract nutrients. The plant is characterized by its slender, thread-like stems that twine around its host. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, often parasitizing various species of shrubs and grasses.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
