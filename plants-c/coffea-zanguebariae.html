<p>Coffea zanguebariae, commonly known as the Pemba coffee, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Pemba in the Zanzibar archipelago.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen shrub that produces red, fleshy berries containing its seeds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil, typical of its coastal forest habitat. Its leaves are glossy and elliptical, while its flowers are small and white, often clustered in groups.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Coffea zanguebariae is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
