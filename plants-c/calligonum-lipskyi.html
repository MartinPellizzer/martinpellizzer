                    <h1>Calligonum lipskyi</h1>
<p>Calligonum lipskyi, commonly known as the desert tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in sandy or saline soils, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Calligonum lipskyi plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
