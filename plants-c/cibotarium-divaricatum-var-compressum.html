                    <h1>Cibotarium divaricatum var. compressum</h1>
<p>Cibotarium divaricatum var. compressum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cibotium, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often folded or compressed. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in a distinctive pattern along the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and specialty horticulture.</p>
