                    <h1>Cyathea infesta</h1>
<p>Cyathea infesta, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a large evergreen fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and enabling it to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Cyathea infesta plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's forests, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability.</p>
