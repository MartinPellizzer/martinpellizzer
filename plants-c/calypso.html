                    <h1>Calypso</h1>
<p>Calypso, commonly known as the "Queen of the Sea," is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bi-color flowers that often feature a combination of purple and white hues. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or near streams. Its delicate, fragrant blooms are short-lived, adding to its mystique.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Calypso is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
