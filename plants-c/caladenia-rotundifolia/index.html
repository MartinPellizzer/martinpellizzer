                            <h1>Caladenia Rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Caladenia rotundifolia, also known as the round-leafed spider-orchid, is a unique and striking member of the orchid family found primarily in southern Australia. This plant is characterized by its intricate, spider-like flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are round and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid native habitat. The orchid's delicate appearance contrasts with its resilience in harsh environments. It is a popular subject for botanists and plant enthusiasts due to its beauty and ecological significance.</p>
