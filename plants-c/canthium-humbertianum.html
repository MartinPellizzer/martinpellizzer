                    <h1>Canthium humbertianum</h1>
<p>Canthium humbertianum, commonly known as the Humbert's spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its latex-producing sap.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of many species in the spurge family.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal in the wild.</p>
