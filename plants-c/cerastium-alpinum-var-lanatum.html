                    <h1>Cerastium alpinum var. lanatum</h1>
<p>Cerastium alpinum var. lanatum, commonly known as the downy mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in alpine gardens.</p>
