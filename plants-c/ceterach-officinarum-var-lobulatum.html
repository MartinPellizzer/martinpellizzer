                    <h1>Ceterach officinarum var. lobulatum</h1>
<p>Ceterach officinarum var. lobulatum, commonly known as the coastal tufted grass or sea grass, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing tufts of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salty air and strong coastal winds. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune systems and rocky shores. Its flowering spikes produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
