<p>Carex vulpina subsp.</p>
<p>nemorosa, commonly known as the wood sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in wetland areas.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its aesthetic appeal in natural landscapes.</p>
