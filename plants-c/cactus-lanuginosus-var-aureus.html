<p>Cactus lanuginosus var. aureus, commonly known as the golden hair cactus, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly, golden-yellow stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant typically grows in a compact, rounded shape, with the stems elongating as it matures. Its leaves are reduced to small, spiny tubercles, and it produces yellow flowers during the rainy season.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions with minimal care.</p>
