<p>Cyclosorus nakaikeanus, commonly known as the Japanese star moss, is a rare and delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, intricate fronds that form a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest undergrowth in Japan. Its reproductive structures are unique, featuring specialized spore-producing organs called sporangia.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus nakaikeanus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
