                    <h1>Claoxylon</h1>
<p>Claoxylon, commonly known as the "barkless tree," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Asia and is characterized by its unique lack of true bark, with a smooth, greenish-gray stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating.</p>
<p>Claoxylon species are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though they are not widely cultivated for commercial purposes.</p>
