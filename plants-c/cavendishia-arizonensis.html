<p>Cavendishia arizonensis, commonly known as the Arizona Cavendish, is a rare and unique plant native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescence that resembles a cluster of small, white to pink flowers. The plant produces large, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery hair, helping it conserve water in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
