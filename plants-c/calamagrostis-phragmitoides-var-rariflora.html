<p>Calamagrostis phragmitoides var. rariflora, commonly known as the rare flowering reed, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often silver-white in color. The plant produces small, clustered panicles of flowers in late summer, typically ranging from pink to purple in hue. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
