                    <h1>Coreocarpus dissectus var. longilobus</h1>
<p>Coreocarpus dissectus var. longilobus, commonly known as the long-lobed coreocarpus, is a rare and distinctive shrub native to the western Pacific islands.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with elongated, serrated leaflets that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, three-lobed fruits that are characteristic of the coreocarpus genus. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in tropical and subtropical environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
