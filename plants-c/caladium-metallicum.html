                    <h1>Caladium metallicum</h1>
<p>Caladium metallicum, commonly known as the silver leaf caladium, is a tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a metallic sheen, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are not particularly showy but are followed by red berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Caladium metallicum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its foliage rather than its flowers.</p>
