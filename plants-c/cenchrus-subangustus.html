                <h1>Cenchrus subangustus</h1>
<p>Cenchrus subangustus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments. It is well-suited for stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is also used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
