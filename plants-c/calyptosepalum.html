<p>Calyptosepalum, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, where the sepals are fused to form a hood-like covering over the petals and reproductive organs. The plants are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Calyptosepalum species are found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Their flowers are usually small and colorful, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
