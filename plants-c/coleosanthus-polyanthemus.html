<p>Coleosanthus polyanthemus, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a distinctive member of the Cyatheaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 5 meters. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing both male and female spores on separate fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is often protected in its natural habitat.</p>
