The plant is typically found in shaded, moist environments, often growing in association with other understory species. Its conservation status is vulnerable due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>
<p>Calathiana schleicheri is of significant botanical interest due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native ecosystem.</p>
