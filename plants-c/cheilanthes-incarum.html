<p>Cheilanthes incarum, commonly known as the rock fern or narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system and waxy leaf surface.</p>
<p>Cheilanthes incarum plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats and is often found in crevices or on limestone formations.</p>
