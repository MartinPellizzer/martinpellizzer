                    <h1>Crossophrys</h1>
<p>Crossophrys, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent greenish-white petals and a single, elongated lip that resembles a ghostly face. Native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, it thrives in wetland habitats and is often found growing on the trunks of trees. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on photosynthesis through its roots and stems.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and conservation status, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection.</p>
