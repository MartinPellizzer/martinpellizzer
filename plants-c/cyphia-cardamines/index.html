                            <h1>Cyphia Cardamines</h1>
<p>Spring beauty, scientifically known as Cyphia cardamines, is a delicate flowering plant that blooms in early spring. It is native to the Appalachian Mountains and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's name comes from its early blooming period and its striking, star-shaped flowers. Its short stature and vibrant colors make it a standout in woodland gardens. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
