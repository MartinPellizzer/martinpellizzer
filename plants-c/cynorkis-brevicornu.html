<p>Cynorkis brevicornu, commonly known as the short-horned cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being clustered at the base of the plant and the female cones emerging from the crown. It is native to southern Africa and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
