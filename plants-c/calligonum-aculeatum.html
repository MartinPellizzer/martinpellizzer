                    <h1>Calligonum aculeatum</h1>
<p>Calligonum aculeatum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, fleshy, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Calligonum aculeatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion.</p>
