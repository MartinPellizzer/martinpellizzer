                    <h1>Corallorhiza odontorhiza</h1>
<p>Corallorhiza odontorhiza, commonly known as the toothroot coralroot, is an orchid that lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrition.</p>
<p>It is a root-parasitic plant found in the eastern United States, typically in moist, shaded woodlands. The plant has a slender, branched stem and produces small, pale green or white flowers. Its roots are specialized to form symbiotic relationships with fungi in the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and reliance on specific fungal associations, it is considered rare and often difficult to detect.</p>
