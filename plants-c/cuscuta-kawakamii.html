                    <h1>Cuscuta kawakamii</h1>
<p>Cuscuta kawakamii, commonly known as the Japanese dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to East Asia and is often found growing on various herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating on a host and forming specialized structures called haustoria to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Cuscuta kawakamii is an example of a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent but primarily depends on its host for survival.</p>
