<p>Commiphora rostrata var. reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed myrrh tree, is a rare and ancient plant native to the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, reflexed leaf margins and aromatic resinous sap. The plant produces a gum resin that has been historically used in traditional medicine and incense. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
