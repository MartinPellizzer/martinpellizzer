<p>Ctenitis pedicellata, commonly known as the veined tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have a complex, layered structure with multiple pinnae. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystem.</p>
