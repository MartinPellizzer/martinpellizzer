                    <h1>Cyphomandra crassifolia</h1>
<p>Cyphomandra crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, kidney-shaped berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit.</p>
<p>However, the berries contain solanine, making them toxic if consumed in large quantities.</p>
