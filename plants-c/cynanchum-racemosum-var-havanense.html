                    <h1>Cynanchum racemosum var. havanense</h1>
<p>Cynanchum racemosum var. havanense, commonly known as the Cuban milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the summer months. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, open habitats such as forests and grasslands.</p>
