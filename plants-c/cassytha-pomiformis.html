                    <h1>Cassytha pomiformis</h1>
<p>Cassytha pomiformis, commonly known as the mistletoe vine, is a parasitic flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its twining, serpentine stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures, with small, inconspicuous flowers that produce berries. It attaches itself to host plants, drawing nutrients and water through its roots, which can sometimes cause damage to the host.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects.</p>
