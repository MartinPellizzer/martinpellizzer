                    <h1>Ceratopetalorchis uncinata</h1>
<p>Ceratopetalorchis uncinata, commonly known as the hooked orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring elongated, hook-shaped petals that distinguish it from other orchid genera. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-yellow, with a distinct lip that aids in pollination by certain insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ceratopetalorchis uncinata is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
