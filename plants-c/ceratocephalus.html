                    <h1>Ceratocephalus</h1>
<p>Ceratocephalus, commonly known as the burrweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their distinctive, spiny seed heads that resemble small burrs, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Ceratocephalus species are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. They produce small, yellow to brown flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants.</p>
