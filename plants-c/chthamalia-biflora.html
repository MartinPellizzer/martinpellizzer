<p>Chthamalia biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered rockweed, is a marine red alga found in intertidal zones along the Pacific coast of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocky substrates and is characterized by its branching, filamentous thallus. The plant has a distinctive two-flowered structure, with small, clustered reproductive structures called conceptacles. It plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms.</p>
<p>Chthamalia biflora is adapted to withstand tidal forces and fluctuating salinity levels, making it a resilient component of rocky shore communities.</p>
