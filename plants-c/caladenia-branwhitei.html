The plant produces a single, elongated flower with a narrow, hooded labellum, which is a unique feature among orchids. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in open habitats with good drainage.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
