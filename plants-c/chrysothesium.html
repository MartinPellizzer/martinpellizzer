                    <h1>Chrysothesium</h1>
<p>Chrysothesium, commonly known as the golden thistle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and spiny, velvety leaves. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant's foliage is often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Chrysothesium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
