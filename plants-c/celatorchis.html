                    <h1>Celatorchis</h1>
<p>Celatorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Celatorchis is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
