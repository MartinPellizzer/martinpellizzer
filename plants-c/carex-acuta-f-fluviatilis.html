                    <h1>Carex acuta f. fluviatilis</h1>
<p>Carex acuta f. fluviatilis, commonly known as the river sedge, is a variant of the common sedge, characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of spikelets.</p>
<p>It is typically found in wetland environments, including marshes, riverbanks, and along the edges of lakes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are often submerged or only partially exposed. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to moist to aquatic conditions, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems.</p>
