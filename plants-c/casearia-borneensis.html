                    <h1>Casearia borneensis</h1>
<p>Casearia borneensis, commonly known as Bornean casearia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruits are small, woody capsules that release seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in the dense forest understory.</p>
<p>Casearia borneensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has potential uses in traditional medicine.</p>
