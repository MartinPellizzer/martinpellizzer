                    <h1>Cremastus lachnaeus</h1>
<p>Cremastus lachnaeus, commonly known as the green blister beetle, is a species of beetle rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects.</p>
<p>However, it is often associated with certain plants as a pest. The beetle is known for its ability to secrete a toxic substance from its abdomen, which can cause skin irritation in humans. It is typically found in areas with abundant vegetation, particularly in gardens and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves laying eggs in the soil, where the larvae feed on plant roots.</p>
