<p>Cremastosperma peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian burr, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny pod, which helps in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals.</p>
<p>Cremastosperma peruvianum is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
