                    <h1>Cerasus avium var. macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Cerasus avium var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited cherry, is a variant of the bird cherry species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust growth and distinctive, elongated fruits that are typically larger than those of the standard species. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its characteristic large, red or dark red cherries. The leaves are ovate with a serrated edge, and the bark is smooth and grayish in color.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits, though it is less commonly consumed than other cherry species.</p>
