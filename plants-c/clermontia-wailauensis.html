<p>Clermontia wailauensis, commonly known as the Wailauensis hibiscus, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Moloka'i.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a prominent yellow center. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas of montane forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Clermontia wailauensis is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts in Hawaii.</p>
