                    <h1>Carex canescens var. alpicola</h1>
<p>Carex canescens var. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine carex, is a perennial sedge native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, rocky soils in alpine meadows and mountain tundras. The plant has grass-like leaves that are often silver-gray in color, adapted to reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna.</p>
