                    <h1>Cochlearia repens</h1>
<p>Cochlearia repens, commonly known as the creeping winter cabbage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It has small, rounded leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Cochlearia repens is often found growing in rocky or sandy habitats, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
