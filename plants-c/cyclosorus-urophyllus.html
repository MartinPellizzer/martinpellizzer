<p>Cyclosorus urophyllus, commonly known as the broad-leafed water moss, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Ulvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat, ribbon-like leaves that are typically broad and fleshy, often arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. This plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its structure consists of a central stem with branching filaments, and it reproduces through the release of spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Cyclosorus urophyllus plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
