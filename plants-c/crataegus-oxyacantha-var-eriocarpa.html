<p>Crataegus oxyacantha var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage, which gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its leaves are typically oval or elliptical with serrated edges, and the bark is smooth when young but becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
