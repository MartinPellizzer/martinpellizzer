<p>Chrysoglossum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf chrysoglossum, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, blooming in late summer. The plant has fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
