<p>Calophaca vaginalis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in the axils of the leaves. Calophaca vaginalis is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse conditions make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed.</p>
