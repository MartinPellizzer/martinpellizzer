<p>Cereaster flagelliformis, commonly known as the sea whip, is a marine colonial organism belonging to the order Hexaclystida.</p>
<p>It forms dense, branching colonies that resemble soft, gelatinous structures, often found in shallow coastal waters. The plant's body is composed of a central axis with numerous polyps extending from it, which are responsible for feeding and reproduction. It plays a vital role in reef ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for various marine species.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important subject in marine botany studies.</p>
