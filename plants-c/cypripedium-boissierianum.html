                    <h1>Cypripedium boissierianum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium boissierianum, commonly known as the Boissier's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or purple in color. The plant features a single, upright stem with broad, leathery leaves that are dark green and elliptical in shape. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, humus-filled soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
