                    <h1>Callitriche sessilis var. verna</h1>
<p>Callitriche sessilis var. verna, commonly known as spring water star, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has tiny, star-shaped leaves that are often submerged, with small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. It is characterized by its sessile leaves, which are attached directly to the stem without a stalk.</p>
<p>This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments and support aquatic life.</p>
