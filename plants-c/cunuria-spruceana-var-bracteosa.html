                    <h1>Cunuria spruceana var. bracteosa</h1>
<p>Cunuria spruceana var. bracteosa, commonly known as the bracteate cunuria, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, leathery leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common adaptation in its arid habitat. Its flowers, which are typically small and inconspicuous, are borne on short pedicels and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental stability in its native range.</p>
