                    <h1>Chamaefilix gracilis</h1>
<p>Chamaefilix gracilis, commonly known as the slender rock-rose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers during the spring, which are often overlooked due to their modest size. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an ideal choice for xeriscaping and wildflower gardens.</p>
