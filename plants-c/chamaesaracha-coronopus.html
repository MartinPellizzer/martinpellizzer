                    <h1>Chamaesaracha coronopus</h1>
<p>Chamaesaracha coronopus, commonly known as the crowned sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of tiny, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to retain moisture in dry soils.</p>
<p>Chamaesaracha coronopus is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is valued for its resilience in harsh environments.</p>
