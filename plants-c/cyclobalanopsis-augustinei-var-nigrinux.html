                    <h1>Cyclobalanopsis augustinei var. nigrinux</h1>
<p>Cyclobalanopsis augustinei var. nigrinux, commonly known as the black-stemmed ironwood, is a rare and hardy evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its dense, dark bark and long, narrow leaves. The tree produces small, inedible acorns that are encased in a thick, leathery husk. Its slow growth rate and durable wood make it a valuable but seldom harvested species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
