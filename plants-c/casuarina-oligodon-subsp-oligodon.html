<p>Casuarina oligodon subsp.</p>
<p>oligodon, commonly known as the coastal casuarina, is a small evergreen tree native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive feathery foliage, composed of tiny, needle-like leaves arranged in spirals.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, woody cones that contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for native wildlife. It thrives in sandy soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it well adapted to coastal environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various species.</p>
