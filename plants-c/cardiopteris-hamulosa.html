                    <h1>Cardiopteris hamulosa</h1>
<p>Cardiopteris hamulosa, commonly known as the Japanese holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps in moisture retention.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in distinctive patterns.</p>
