                    <h1>Cotoneaster bacillaris</h1>
<p>Cotoneaster bacillaris, commonly known as the dwarf cotoneaster, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Cotoneaster bacillaris is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value.</p>
