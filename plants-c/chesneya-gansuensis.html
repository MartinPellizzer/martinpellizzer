                    <h1>Chesneya gansuensis</h1>
<p>Chesneya gansuensis, commonly known as the Gansu chesneya, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Gansu Province in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
