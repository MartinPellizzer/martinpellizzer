                    <h1>Calamagrostis pisinna</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis pisinna, commonly known as the narrowleaf reed, is a perennial grass native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and upright, with a bluish-green hue. Its flowering stems produce panicles of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Calamagrostis pisinna is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity.</p>
