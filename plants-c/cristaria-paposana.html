<p>Cristaria paposana, commonly known as the starry water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, with a distinctive central spire. These flowers open in the morning and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty.</p>
<p>Cristaria paposana plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
