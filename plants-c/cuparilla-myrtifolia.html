                    <h1>Cuparilla myrtifolia</h1>
<p>Cuparilla myrtifolia, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant has a complex root system, including pneumatophores, which allow it to absorb oxygen from the air in waterlogged soils. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
<p>Cuparilla myrtifolia is also valued for its timber and traditional medicinal uses.</p>
