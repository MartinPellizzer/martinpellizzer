                    <h1>Cyperus rotundus var. pendulus</h1>
<p>Cyperus rotundus var. pendulus, commonly known as the hanging sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are often reddish or purplish in color. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread aggressively in moist soils. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, along riverbanks, and in flooded areas.</p>
<p>Its adaptability makes it both a common weed and an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
