                            <h1>Coursetia Fruticosa</h1>
<p>Coursetia fruticosa is a hardy shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is known for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant features small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss and conserve moisture. Its flowers, which appear in late spring, are typically pale green or white and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Coursetia fruticosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ecological benefits.</p>
