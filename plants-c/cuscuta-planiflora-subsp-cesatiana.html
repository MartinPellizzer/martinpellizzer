<p>Cuscuta planiflora subsp.</p>
<p>cesatiana, commonly known as the flatleaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts.</p>
<p>The plant is native to regions of Central and South America and often grows on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
