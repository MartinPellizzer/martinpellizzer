<p>Cleistocactus areolatus, commonly known as the red-bellied cactus, is a species native to southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in areoles, which are small, raised structures from which spines, flowers, and other growths emerge. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that bloom in the evening, a trait common among many night-blooming cacti. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance.</p>
