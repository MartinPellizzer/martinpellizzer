<p>Culcasia glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular arrowhead, is a tropical aquatic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered with small, glandular dots, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and can form dense mats on the water surface. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the sediment, while its floating leaves provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Culcasia glandulosa is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various water conditions.</p>
