                    <h1>Cypripedium × elsteadianum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium × elsteadianum, commonly known as the Elstead orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium pubescens.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base, which is a typical feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in woodland habitats, preferring moist, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single flower per stem, often in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
