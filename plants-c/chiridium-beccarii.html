<p>Chiridium beccarii, commonly known as the Bornean star orchid, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chiridium beccarii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
