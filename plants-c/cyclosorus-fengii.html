                    <h1>Cyclosorus fengii</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus fengii, commonly known as the Feng's cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its reproductive structures include sporocarps that release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health.</p>
