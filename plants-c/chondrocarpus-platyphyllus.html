<p>Chondrocarpus platyphyllus, commonly known as the flat-leaf mat grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and features narrow, flat leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and montane environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
