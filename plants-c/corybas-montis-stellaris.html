<p>Corybas montis-stellaris, commonly known as the star mountain caladium, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of New Guinea, where it thrives in cool, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that display a range of colors from deep red to bright green. Its flowers, though small, are highly specialized, featuring a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
