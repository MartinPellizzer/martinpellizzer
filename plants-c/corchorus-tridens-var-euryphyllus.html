                    <h1>Corchorus tridens var. euryphyllus</h1>
<p>Corchorus tridens var. euryphyllus, commonly known as the broad-leafed kochia, is a variant of the kochia species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is an annual herb that thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important plant in ecological studies and a potential candidate for phytoremediation.</p>
