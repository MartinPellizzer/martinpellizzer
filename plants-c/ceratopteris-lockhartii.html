<p>Ceratopteris lockhartii, commonly known as the New Zealand water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight and nutrients. Its rhizomes spread along the water's surface, anchoring the plant and facilitating the growth of new fronds.</p>
<p>Ceratopteris lockhartii plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality.</p>
