                    <h1>Cassytha novoguineensis</h1>
<p>Cassytha novoguineensis, commonly known as the creeping grapevines, is a parasitic vine native to tropical regions of Australia and Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems that often grow along the ground or up other plants. The plant lacks true leaves but has modified stems that perform photosynthesis, while its roots penetrate the host plant to absorb nutrients. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants.</p>
