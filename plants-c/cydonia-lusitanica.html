<p>Cydonia lusitanica, commonly known as the Portuguese quince, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It produces fragrant, white flowers in early spring, followed by yellow, fleshy fruits that ripen in late summer. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves. The fruit is often used in culinary applications, though it is typically cooked due to its high acidity.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant.</p>
