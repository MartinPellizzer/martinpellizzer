<p>Cirsium eliasianum, commonly known as Elias's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and large, purple to pinkish composite flower heads. Its leaves are typically rough, lobed, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces achene seeds with pappus, aiding in wind dispersal, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
