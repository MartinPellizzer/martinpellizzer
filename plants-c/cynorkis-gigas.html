<p>Cynorkis gigas, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large, ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. Native to southern Africa, this plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its cones are dioecious, with separate male and female plants producing pollen and seeds respectively.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, Cynorkis gigas is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts.</p>
