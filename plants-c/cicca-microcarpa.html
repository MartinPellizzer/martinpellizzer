                    <h1>Cicca microcarpa</h1>
<p>Cicca microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves that are typically dark green. Native to the tropical regions of South America, this plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures include a large, cone-like pollen sac and a small, seed-bearing female cone.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
