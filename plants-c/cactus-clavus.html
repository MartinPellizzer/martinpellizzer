                    <h1>Cactus clavus</h1>
<p>Cactus clavus, commonly known as the knob cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its spines provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The cactus clavus is often used in traditional medicine for its potential healing properties.</p>
