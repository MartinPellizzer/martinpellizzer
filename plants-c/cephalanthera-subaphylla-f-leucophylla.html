                    <h1>Cephalanthera subaphylla f. leucophylla</h1>
<p>Cephalanthera subaphylla f. leucophylla, commonly known as the white-leaved greenhood, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique hood-shaped flower that encloses the reproductive structures, a feature typical of the Orchidaceae family. The plant produces pale green to white flowers with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat.</p>
<p>This orchid is listed as endangered due to habitat destruction and limited distribution.</p>
