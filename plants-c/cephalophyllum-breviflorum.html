                    <h1>Cephalophyllum breviflorum</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum breviflorum, commonly known as the short-flowered headplant, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of spines that protect it from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted green foliage. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
