                    <h1>Cyphia smithiae</h1>
<p>Cyphia smithiae, commonly known as the Smith's cyphia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid purple and white flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a compact, terrestrial growth habit with fleshy, strap-like leaves that store moisture, adapting it to its high-altitude environment. Cyphia smithiae thrives in cool, shaded areas with high humidity, often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
