                    <h1>Carex tunicata</h1>
<p>Carex tunicata, commonly known as the tufted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.
