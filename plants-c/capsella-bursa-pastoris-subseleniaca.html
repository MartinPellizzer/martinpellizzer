<p>Capsella bursa-pastoris subseleniaca, commonly known as the common chickweed or mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, alternate leaves that are often heart-shaped or kidney-shaped, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, lawns, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed but also a subject of study in plant ecology and ethnobotany.</p>
