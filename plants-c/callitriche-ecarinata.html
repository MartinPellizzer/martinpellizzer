                    <h1>Callitriche ecarinata</h1>
<p>Callitriche ecarinata, commonly known as the hookless water-starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, and it produces tiny, star-shaped flowers that float on the water surface. It is a member of the Haloragaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true stems, with leaves arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>Callitriche ecarinata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its filtration abilities.</p>
