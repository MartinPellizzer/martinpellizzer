<p>Copernicia excelsa, commonly known as the carnauba wax palm, is a tall, slender palm native to northeastern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray-green trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 5 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are the primary source of carnauba wax, a valuable substance used in industries such as cosmetics and food packaging.</p>
<p>The species is also notable for its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils and its ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>
