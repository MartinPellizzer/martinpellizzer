<p>Caesalpinia fimbriata, commonly known as the lace-leaf coral tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, fern-like, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers arranged in dense, branched clusters, which bloom in the spring or early summer. Its fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release seeds, a common feature among plants in the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>Caesalpinia fimbriata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types.</p>
