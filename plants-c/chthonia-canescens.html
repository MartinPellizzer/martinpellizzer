<p>Chthonia canescens, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, bluish-green leaves and trumpet-shaped, pale blue or lavender flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture conditions. Its reproductive strategy involves producing small, capsule-like fruits that disperse seeds through wind and animal activity.</p>
<p>Chthonia canescens plays a role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems and provides nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
