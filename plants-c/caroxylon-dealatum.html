<p>Caroxylon dealatum, commonly known as the desert broom.</p>
<p>It is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowering stems produce clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which are adapted for pollination by wind or insects.</p>
<p>Caroxylon dealatum is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
