                    <h1>Cyclosorus striatus var. molundensis</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus striatus var. molundensis, commonly known as the Molund's water clover, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into small, overlapping lobes, resembling a clover leaf. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to substrates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often submerged or floating near the water's surface.</p>
<p>The varietal form, molundensis, is distinguished by its unique leaf patterns and habitat preferences compared to the standard species.</p>
