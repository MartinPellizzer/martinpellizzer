                    <h1>Cremanthodium plantagineum f. ellisii</h1>
<p>Cremanthodium plantagineum f. ellisii, commonly known as the Ellis's alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the European Alps.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Its leaves are usually basal, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution.</p>
