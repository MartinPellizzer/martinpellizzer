<p>Centaurium littorale subsp.</p>
<p>uliginosum, commonly known as the marsh centaury, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to wet conditions and plays a role in supporting local insect populations.</p>
