                    <h1>Cypripedium passerinum var. minganense</h1>
<p>Cypripedium passerinum var. minganense, commonly known as the Mingan lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the boreal forests of eastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and a tall, slender flowering stem that bears a loose cluster of pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. It is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is essential for its survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its continued existence.</p>
