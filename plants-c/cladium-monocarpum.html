<p>Cladium monocarpum, commonly known as the sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland ecosystems in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like blades that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes and shallow waters. The plant has a robust rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in muddy or aquatic environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in summer, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>Cladium monocarpum plays a crucial role in wetland habitats by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
