<p>Centropogon beslerioides, commonly known as the Beslerian flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>

The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, surrounded by the vibrant bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Centropogon beslerioides is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
