                    <h1>Cardamine tenuifolia var. dissecta</h1>
<p>Cardamine tenuifolia var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected water-cress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are finely dissected, giving it a lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wet soils.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in woodland gardens and streamside habitats.</p>
