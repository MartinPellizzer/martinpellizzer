                    <h1>Centunculus alpinus</h1>
<p>Centunculus alpinus, commonly known as the alpine buttonweed, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Primulaceae family and typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>Centunculus alpinus is often found in nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold, windy conditions.</p>
