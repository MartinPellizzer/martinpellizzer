                    <h1>Ceratozamia norstogii</h1>
<p>Ceratozamia norstogii, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate with adequate sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
