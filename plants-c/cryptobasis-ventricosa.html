<p>Cryptobasis ventricosa, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a perennial shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its berries, which are usually red or orange, are an important food source for birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Cryptobasis ventricosa is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found growing in rocky or mountainous terrain.</p>
