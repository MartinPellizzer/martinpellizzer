<p>Cottendorfia tillandsioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a delicate, almost ethereal appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
