<p>Callitris sulcata, commonly known as the smooth bark pine, is a species of conifer native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and smooth, fissured bark that provides a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are scale-like and closely pressed to the stems, typical of many coniferous species.</p>
<p>Callitris sulcata is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments.</p>
