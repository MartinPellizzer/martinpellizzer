<p>Coespeletia albarregensis, commonly known as the Albarreg√©n's cholla, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, branching stems that are adapted to store water and withstand high temperatures. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are reduced to small spines, which help minimize water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Coespeletia albarregensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various desert organisms.</p>
