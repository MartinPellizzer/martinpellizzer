<p>Coelopyrum coriaceum, commonly known as the brittle bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap air and aid in floating. The plant is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are thin and delicate, often appearing in clusters.</p>
<p>Despite its simple appearance, it plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microscopic organisms.</p>
