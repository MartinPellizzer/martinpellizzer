<p>Clusia havetioides var. pauciflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved glory bush, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, providing a dense foliage cover. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes. It is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage rather than its flowers.</p>
