                    <h1>Camarotea</h1>
<p>Camarotea, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating in water. Camarotea species typically thrive in moist environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plants have rhizomes that help anchor them in the substrate and absorb nutrients.</p>
<p>Their reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal.</p>
