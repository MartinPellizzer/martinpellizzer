                    <h1>Cheiridopsis parvibracteata</h1>
<p>Cheiridopsis parvibracteata, commonly known as the small-bract carpetweed, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring and summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
