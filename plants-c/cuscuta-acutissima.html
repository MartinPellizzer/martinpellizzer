                    <h1>Cuscuta acutissima</h1>
<p>Cuscuta acutissima, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. The plant's stems are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called haustoria, which attach to the host and extract water and nutrients. It is often found on crops such as barley, wheat, and cotton, making it a significant agricultural pest.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a challenging weed to control.</p>
