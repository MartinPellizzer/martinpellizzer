<p>Cordia decandra, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, Cordia decandra is both ecologically and culturally significant.</p>
