                    <h1>Cardamine pachystigma var. dissectifolia</h1>
<p>Cardamine pachystigma var. dissectifolia, commonly known as the dissect-leaved water cress, is a herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of finely divided, pinnately lobed leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its roots are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic properties.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its deeply dissected foliage compared to the typical form of Cardamine pachystigma.</p>
