<p>Cephalomanes cumingii, commonly known as the yellow sand dollar, is a species of sea urchin found in tropical and subtropical marine environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cidaridae and is characterized by its smooth, flattened body covered in a calcareous test. The spines of Cephalomanes cumingii are short and often covered in a fine layer of sediment, giving it a sandy appearance. It primarily inhabits sandy bottoms in shallow coastal waters.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to sediment turnover and serving as a food source for various predators.</p>
