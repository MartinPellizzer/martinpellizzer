                    <h1>Cavallium comosum</h1>
<p>Cavallium comosum, commonly known as the hairy thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a robust root system and thrives in well-drained soils. Its fuzzy, glandular hairs on the stems and leaves help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Cavallium comosum is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
