                    <h1>Campanula hostii var. uniflora</h1>
<p>Campanula hostii var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces a single, showy blue or violet bell-shaped flower at the end of each stem. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
