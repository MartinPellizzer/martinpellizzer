                    <h1>Cuscuta stenantha</h1>
<p>Cuscuta stenantha, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hairless stems. The plant attaches to its host using specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Cuscuta stenantha is often found on plants such as milkweed and other members of the legume family.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and health of its host, making it an important ecological component in certain ecosystems.</p>
