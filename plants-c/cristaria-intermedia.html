                    <h1>Cristaria intermedia</h1>
<p>Cristaria intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant features delicate, floating leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, with a central stem that bears small, inconspicuous flowers. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal, facilitating its spread across aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Cristaria intermedia plays a minor but ecologically important role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
