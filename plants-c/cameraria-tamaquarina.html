<p>Cameraria tamaquarina, commonly known as the Tamaquara leafminer, is a small moth species belonging to the family Lyonetiidae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The larvae of this species feed on the leaves of the Tamaquara tree, which is a type of palm known as Attalea maripa. The plant's leaves are broad and fan-shaped, providing a habitat for various insects and contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem.</p>
<p>The interaction between Cameraria tamaquarina and its host plant is an example of a specialized herbivory relationship in tropical flora.</p>
