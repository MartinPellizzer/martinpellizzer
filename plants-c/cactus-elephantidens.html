                    <h1>Cactus elephantidens</h1>
<p>Cactus elephantidens, commonly known as the African candelabra cactus, is a unique species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that resemble a candelabra, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Despite its appearance, it is not a true cactus but belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds.</p>
