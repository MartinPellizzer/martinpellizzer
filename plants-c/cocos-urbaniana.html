                    <h1>Cocos urbaniana</h1>
<p>Cocos urbaniana, commonly known as the urban coconut tree, is a rare and unique species of palm native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into clustered fruits resembling coconuts, though they are not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cocos urbaniana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
