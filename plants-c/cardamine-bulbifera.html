                    <h1>Cardamine bulbifera</h1>
<p>Cardamine bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous water crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and delicate, floating or submerged leaves that help it thrive in aquatic or wetland environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. Its unique feature is the production of bulbils, which are small, vegetative propagules that form at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>These bulbils allow for efficient reproduction and spread in suitable moist habitats.</p>
