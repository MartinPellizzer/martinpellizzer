                    <h1>Cocos amara</h1>
<p>Cocos amara, commonly known as the bitter coconut, is a flowering plant belonging to the Arecaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into hard, spiny fruits containing a single seed. Unlike the widely cultivated coconut, Cocos amara is less common and primarily grows in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it distinct from other coconut species, with a more robust and less commercially significant profile.</p>
