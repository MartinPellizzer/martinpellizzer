                    <h1>Cyclosorus sinodentatus</h1>
<p>Cyclosorus sinodentatus, commonly known as the Chinese cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four tooth-like lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters with soft, muddy substrates, often in regions of Southeast Asia. Its reproductive structures include small, yellowish spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
