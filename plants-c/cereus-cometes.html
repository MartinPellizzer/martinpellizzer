<p>Cereus cometes, commonly known as the comet cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, a trait common among many cacti. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths and bats.</p>
