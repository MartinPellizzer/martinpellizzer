                    <h1>Coelophragmus</h1>
<p>Coelophragmus, commonly known as the desert cactus or the golden cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in Mexico and the southwestern United States. They are characterized by their cylindrical stems, which are often ribbed and covered in spines for protection. The flowers, which are typically bright yellow or orange, bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Coelophragmus species are drought-tolerant and require minimal water, making them well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
