<p>Calligonum canescens, commonly known as the desert tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Calligonum canescens plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
