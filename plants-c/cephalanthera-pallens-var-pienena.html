                    <h1>Cephalanthera pallens var. pienena</h1>
<p>Cephalanthera pallens var. pienena, commonly known as the Pienena lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, spiraling inflorescence of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is typically found in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction.</p>
