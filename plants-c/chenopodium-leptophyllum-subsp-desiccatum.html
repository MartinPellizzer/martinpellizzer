<p>Chenopodium leptophyllum subsp.</p>
<p>desiccatum, commonly known as desert goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, greenish flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through mechanisms such as crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), which allows it to conserve water. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and the plant can go dormant during extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in desert ecosystems.</p>
