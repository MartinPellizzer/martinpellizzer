                    <h1>Coryanthes sumneriana</h1>
<p>Coryanthes sumneriana, commonly known as the Sumner's coryanthe, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Costa Rica and Panama.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its large, intricate, and often colorful floral structures, which are typically adorned with specialized nectar-producing structures called resupinate columns. The flowers exhibit a unique morphology with a labellum that serves as a landing platform for pollinators, particularly bees and wasps. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
