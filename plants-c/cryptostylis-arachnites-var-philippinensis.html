<p>Cryptostylis arachnites var. philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, spider-like appearance, with long, thin sepals and petals that resemble legs. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical forest environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
