                    <h1>Chenopodium littorale</h1>
<p>Chenopodium littorale, commonly known as sea blite, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help retain water in arid or coastal conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its seeds are enclosed in small, capsule-like fruits that disperse easily by wind.</p>
<p>Chenopodium littorale is often found along shorelines, salt marshes, and coastal dunes, contributing to stabilizing these fragile ecosystems.</p>
