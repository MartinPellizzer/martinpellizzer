                    <h1>Clypea rotunda</h1>
<p>Clypea rotunda, commonly known as the globe sedge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of broad, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common sight in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Clypea rotunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens.</p>
