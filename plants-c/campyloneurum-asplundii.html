<p>Campyloneurum asplundii, commonly known as the Asplund's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces spores in small, cone-like structures called strobili, which are borne on the upper part of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native range.</p>
