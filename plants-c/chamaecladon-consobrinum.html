<p>Chamaecladon consobrinum, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its deep root system. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Chamaecladon consobrinum is also known for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in desert landscapes.</p>
