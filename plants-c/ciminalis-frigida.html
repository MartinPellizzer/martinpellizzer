<p>Ciminalis frigida, commonly known as the cold-tolerant alpine herb, is a hardy plant native to high-altitude regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. The plant features slender, hairy stems and pinnately divided leaves that help reduce water loss in cold climates. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience to frost and poor soil conditions, it is often used in alpine gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
