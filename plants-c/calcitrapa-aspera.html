<p>Calcitrapa aspera, commonly known as the rough hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are rough to the touch, hence the species name "aspera," and its yellow flowers bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>Calcitrapa aspera is often found in disturbed areas and can spread through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
