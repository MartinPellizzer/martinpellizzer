<p>Cadaba fruticosa, commonly known as the rock rose or desert rose, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, succulent stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers, which bloom during the rainy season. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and erosion control in dry landscapes.</p>
