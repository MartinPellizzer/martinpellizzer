                    <h1>Callichroa nutans</h1>
<p>Callichroa nutans, commonly known as the drooping flame vine, is a striking tropical climbing plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vivid orange to red tubular flowers that hang in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often mistaken for those of other ornamental vines. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth habit makes it ideal for covering trellises or arches in gardens.</p>
