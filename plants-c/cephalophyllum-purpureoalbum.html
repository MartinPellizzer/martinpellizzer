                    <h1>Cephalophyllum purpureoalbum</h1>
<p>Cephalophyllum purpureoalbum, commonly known as the purple-white headplant, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, fleshy stems that resemble a head, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple and white, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation to minimize water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Cephalophyllum purpureoalbum is often grown as a decorative cactus due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
