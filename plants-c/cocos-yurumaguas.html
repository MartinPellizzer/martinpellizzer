<p>Cocos yurumaguas, commonly known as the Yurumaguas coconut, is a unique palm species native to the Peruvian Amazon.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces coconuts that are typically smaller than those of the common coconut, with a thick husk and a sweet, aromatic flesh. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in swampy or wetland areas.</p>
<p>The Yurumaguas coconut is valued for its edible fruit and has cultural significance among local communities.</p>
