<p>Corynostylis benthamii, commonly known as the Benthams' clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Microlepidoteae.</p>
<p>It is native to Australia, particularly found in the southeastern regions, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a creeping rhizome with dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. Its reproductive structures are unique, with sporangia borne on specialized stalks called sporophylls.</p>
<p>Corynostylis benthamii is of interest to botanists due to its primitive characteristics and its role in understanding the evolution of ferns.</p>
