                    <h1>Cuscuta xanthochortos var. carinata</h1>
<p>Cuscuta xanthochortos var. carinata, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to regions of Australia and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can form dense infestations on its host, potentially weakening or killing the plant.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems.</p>
