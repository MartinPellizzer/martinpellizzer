                    <h1>Carex vulgaris var. juncea</h1>
<p>Carex vulgaris var. juncea, commonly known as slender flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with staminate and pistillate spikelets arranged in a distinct sequence.</p>
