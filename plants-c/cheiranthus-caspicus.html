<p>Cheiranthus caspicus, commonly known as the Caspian poppy, is a flowering plant native to the dry regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, often with a distinctive central blotch. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
