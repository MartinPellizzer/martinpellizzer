                    <h1>Carex inflata var. utriculata</h1>
<p>Carex inflata var. utriculata, commonly known as the bladder sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikes of pale to greenish flowers. The plant has distinctive, inflated, bladder-like structures called utricles that enclose its seeds, a feature that gives it its common name. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils.</p>
