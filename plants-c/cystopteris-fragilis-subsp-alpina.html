<p>Cystopteris fragilis subsp.</p>
<p>alpina, commonly known as the alpine water fern, is a fern species native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, fragile fronds that often break easily, hence its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky areas. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a finely divided structure that enhances its ornamental appearance.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to cool, humid climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
