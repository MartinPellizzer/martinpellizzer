                    <h1>Calamagrostis halleriana var. pulchella</h1>
<p>Calamagrostis halleriana var. pulchella, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and its striking purple to pinkish inflorescence that appears in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in wet meadows or along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, making it a valuable plant for erosion control.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that contrasts beautifully with the colorful flowering spikes.</p>
