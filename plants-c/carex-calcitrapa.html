                    <h1>Carex calcitrapa</h1>
<p>Carex calcitrapa, commonly known as the limestone sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny brown flowers. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. It is typically found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Carex calcitrapa is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
