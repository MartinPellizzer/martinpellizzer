<p>Crepidium langkawiense, commonly known as the Langkawi orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively on the island of Langkawi in Malaysia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in the humid, shaded environments of tropical rainforests, often growing on tree trunks or roots. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited research, the conservation status of this species remains a concern.</p>
