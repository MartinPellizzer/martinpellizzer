                    <h1>Cactus pusillus</h1>
<p>Cactus pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf cactus, is a small, spineless plant native to the deserts of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with a globular or cylindrical shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
