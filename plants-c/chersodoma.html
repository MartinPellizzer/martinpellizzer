<p>Chersodoma, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plants are shrubs or small trees characterized by their compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. Chersodoma species are valued for their hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and craftsmanship.</p>
<p>However, many species are now threatened due to overharvesting and habitat loss.</p>
