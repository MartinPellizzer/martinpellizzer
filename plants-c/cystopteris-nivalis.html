                    <h1>Cystopteris nivalis</h1>
<p>Cystopteris nivalis, commonly known as the alpine water fern, is a small, delicate fern native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has finely divided, pinnately compound fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the fern family.</p>
<p>Cystopteris nivalis is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine zones where temperatures remain cool year-round.</p>
