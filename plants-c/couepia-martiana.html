                    <h1>Couepia martiana</h1>
<p>Couepia martiana, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or the wild starfruit, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that resemble starfruits, though they are not related to the common starfruit (Carambola). Its botanical features include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a distinct floral structure.</p>
<p>Couepia martiana is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests.</p>
