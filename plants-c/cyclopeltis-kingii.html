                    <h1>Cyclopeltis kingii</h1>
<p>Cyclopeltis kingii, commonly known as the King's cyclopeltis, is a rare and unique fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged fronds that form a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant's leaves are typically leathery and have a deep green color, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. Cyclopeltis kingii thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
