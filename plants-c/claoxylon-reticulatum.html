                    <h1>Claoxylon reticulatum</h1>
<p>Claoxylon reticulatum, commonly known as the reticulate tallowwood, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia and parts of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and its distinctive, irregularly shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its wood is valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and furniture-making.</p>
<p>Claoxylon reticulatum plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
