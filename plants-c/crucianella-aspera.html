                    <h1>Crucianella aspera</h1>
<p>Crucianella aspera, commonly known as the rough sea bean, is a small shrub native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, bean-like fruits that are often covered in a rough, textured surface. It thrives in saline and coastal environments, demonstrating a high degree of salt tolerance.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in coastal restoration projects to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
