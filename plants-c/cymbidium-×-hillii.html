                    <h1>Cymbidium × hillii</h1>
<p>Cymbidium × hillii, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cymbidium goeringii and Cymbidium lowianum.</p>
<p>It is a sympodial orchid with a pseudobulb structure that supports its growth and storage of nutrients. The plant produces inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This orchid is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and adaptability to cultivation.</p>
