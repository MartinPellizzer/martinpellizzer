                    <h1>Caralluma tsumebensis</h1>
<p>Caralluma tsumebensis, commonly known as the Tsumeb prickly pear, is a succulent plant native to Namibia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spine-tipped stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Caralluma tsumebensis is also valued for its potential medicinal properties in traditional African medicine.</p>
