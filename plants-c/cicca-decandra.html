                    <h1>Cicca decandra</h1>
<p>Cicca decandra, commonly known as the many-flowered cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, clustered cones instead of flowers, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Native to tropical regions of Africa, it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
