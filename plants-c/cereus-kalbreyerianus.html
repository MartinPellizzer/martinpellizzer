                    <h1>Cereus kalbreyerianus</h1>
<p>Cereus kalbreyerianus, commonly known as the Kalbreyer's candleplant, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a trait common among many cacti adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss and provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in dry climates.</p>
