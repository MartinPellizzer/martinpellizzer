                    <h1>Catoblastus mesocarpus</h1>
<p>Catoblastus mesocarpus, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fibrous mesocarp, which contributes to its buoyancy and structural support in tidal waters. The plant has a complex root system, including pneumatophores, which allow it to absorb oxygen from the water. Its leaves are alternate and elliptical, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, berry-like structure that plays a role in seed dispersal by water and animals.</p>
