<p>Crepidomanes minutum subsp.</p>
<p>proliferum, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
