<p>Cycas circinalis subsp.</p>
<p>riuminiana, commonly known as the Philippine cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones ovoid, both typically appearing at the top of the trunk. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests or on rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
