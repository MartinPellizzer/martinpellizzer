                    <h1>Clitocyamos</h1>
<p>Clitocyamos, commonly known as the coastal redwood, is a unique conifer native to the temperate rainforests of southern California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reddish-brown bark and conical shape, which helps it withstand strong coastal winds and salt spray. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by cone-like structures that release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
