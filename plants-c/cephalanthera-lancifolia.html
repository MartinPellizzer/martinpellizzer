                    <h1>Cephalanthera lancifolia</h1>
<p>Cephalanthera lancifolia, commonly known as the lancolate orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while the flowers are borne on tall, slender stems.</p>
<p>Cephalanthera lancifolia is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, relying instead on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption.</p>
