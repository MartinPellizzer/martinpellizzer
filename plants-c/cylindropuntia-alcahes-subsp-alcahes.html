<p>Cylindropuntia alcahes subsp.</p>
<p>alcahes, commonly known as the Arizona hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual element to its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in rocky areas and along dry washes in Arizona and southern California.</p>
