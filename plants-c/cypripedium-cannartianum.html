                    <h1>Cypripedium cannartianum</h1>
<p>Cypripedium cannartianum, commonly known as the Cannartian lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually broad and dark green, adapted to maximize light absorption in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
