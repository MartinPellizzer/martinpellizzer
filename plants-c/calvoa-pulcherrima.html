<p>Calvoa pulcherrima, commonly known as the beautiful calvoa, is a rare and striking member of the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Andean regions of South America, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant is characterized by its large, velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a challenging but rewarding plant for cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calvoa pulcherrima is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
