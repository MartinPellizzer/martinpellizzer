<p>Commelina diffusa subsp.</p>
<p>scandens, commonly known as the creeping spiderwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across moist soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, blue-violet flowers with three petals and three sepals, typical of the Commelina genus. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in disturbed areas where it can outcompete other vegetation.</p>
