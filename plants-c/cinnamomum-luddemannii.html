<p>Cinnamomum luddemannii, commonly known as the Luddemann's cinnamon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces oval, reddish-brown fruits that contain a single seed. Its bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated than other cinnamon species due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
