                    <h1>Coridothymus</h1>
<p>Coridothymus, commonly known as the sand thyme, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, often found in dry, sandy or gravelly soils. They typically produce small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in the spring or early summer. Coridothymus species are generally low-growing, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Their medicinal properties have been explored in traditional herbal remedies for their potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.</p>
