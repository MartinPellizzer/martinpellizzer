<p>Cycas micholitzii subsp.</p>
<p>multipinnata, commonly known as the multi-pinnate cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, feather-like leaves that are arranged in a dense, fan-like pattern.</p>
<p>The plant produces large, cone-like structures known as strobili, which contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
