                    <h1>Critonia naiguatensis</h1>
<p>Critonia naiguatensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the highlands of Guatemala.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Critonia naiguatensis is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for protective measures.</p>
